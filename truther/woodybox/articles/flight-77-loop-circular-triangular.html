		<span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">The above picture illustrates the final loop of Flight 77 according to the National Transportation &amp; Safety Board (NTSB), which allegedly relies on military (RADES) radar data.</span><br /><br /><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">The statements of nine controllers from Dulles Airport (TRACON), published on my last blog entry </span></span><br /><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" ></span><br /><a href="http://911woodybox.blogspot.com/2009/03/dulles-airport-controllers-on-loop-of.html"><span style="font-family:arial;">http://911woodybox.blogspot.com/2009/03/dulles-airport-controllers-on-loop-of.html</span></a><br /><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" ></span><br /><span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">are still pending interpretation, which I'm going to deliver here. Needless to say, if the official Flight 77 loop is correct, it should match the controllers' accounts.</span><br /><br /><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">Here are the key results of my analysis:</span> </span><span style="font-family:arial;"><br /></span><span style="font-family:arial;"><br /><br /><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-size:130%;" ><span style="font-size:180%;">1</span> </span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">- None of the controllers mentions the striking circular shape of the NTSB loop. You would expect the word "circle" or "circular" somewhere, but nil return. Quite the contrary, according to some controllers, the radar target was moving along a polygonal path, with corners and straight segments between the corners. </span><br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">Robert Utley</span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)"> describes a triangular path with two sharp corners:</span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-STYLE: italic"> "I observed a primary target approximately 7 miles east of AML, heading eastbound, when the target was about 1 mile west of DCA it made a right turn heading southwestbound. When it was about 3 miles north of DAA it made a sharp turn northbound, when it was about 10 miles east of AML it made a sharp turn eastbound, the target then dropped out of radar about 3 miles west of DCA. Equipment configuration was unknown to me."</span><br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">James E. Walsh</span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">'s path is a slight variation to Utley's, adding a corner and thus generating a quadrangle: </span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-STYLE: italic">The target proceeded to a point 1 mile west of Chrystal City and turned southwest to a point 5 miles northeast of DAA. It then made a right turn, 2 miles north of DAA, and proceeded northbound. 3 miles later the target turned northeastbound and shortly thereafter radar contact was lost.</span><br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">William T. Howell</span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)"> also mentions a sharp turn: </span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-STYLE: italic">"The target went a few miles south of DCA and then made a sharp turn northbound, back in the direction of DCA."</span><br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">Robert Devery</span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)"> mentions several turns, too, and stresses that, after turning south, </span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-STYLE: italic">"for a few miles, it continued south."</span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">, implying that the target moved straight south for a while.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-size:180%;" ><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">2</span></span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)"> - The position data of some accounts are absolutely incompatible with the NTSB loop:</span><br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">Todd Lewis</span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)"> locates the target east of the Potomac: </span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-STYLE: italic">"The target went just south of the White House then turned southeast and disappeared."</span><br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">Robert J. Brickley</span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">: </span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-STYLE: italic">"The aircraft proceeded to a point approximately 8 miles southwest of P-56, made a right 360 degree turn"</span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">. The starting point of the NTSB loop is located 4 miles (not 8) southwest of P-56.</span><br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">Robert Utley</span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)"> claims that the target was "</span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-STYLE: italic">10 miles east of AML</span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)"> (Dulles Airport)" after the loop and turned sharply eastbound before dropping from radar 3 miles west of DCA; so according to him, the target approached the Pentagon from due west, not southwest, as the NTSB data imply.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-size:180%;" ><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">3 </span></span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">- The statements were made on 9/12/01, one day after the attacks, as part of a routine FAA procedure to document and investigate accidents. Bad memory can therefore neither explain the huge factual discrepancies between the controllers and the NTSB nor the discrepancies between controller and controller. The Flight 77 (?) target popped up on the radar screens for at least 5 minutes, enough time to concentrate on the path and keep it in memory for a few hours. We can be sure that controllers were not conducted by carelessness when filling out the FAA form.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-size:180%;" ><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">4 </span></span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">- The assumption that the NTSB loop is correct leads inevitably to the question why the controller's accounts are not compatible with it, and what have been the motives of the controllers to alter it. I can't see any reasonable motive in this scenario.</span><br /><br /><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">However, the correctness of the NTSB loop is being shattered by eyewitnesses who have seen the plane east of the Potomac ( <a href="http://www.thepentacon.com/">http://www.thepentacon.com/</a> ) as well as real-time radio messages open to the public. NEADS commander Kevin Nasypany and his crew have located the target at "six miles east of the White House", a point that is far away from the official loop. </span><br /><br /><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">The conflicting </span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)"></span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">accounts of the controllers suggest that they were told - possibly for "national security reasons" - to keep their mouth about the real loop and move it to an area exclusively west of the Potomac. The exact position and shape was obviously not specified, thus generating a logical mess. </span><br /><br /><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">In the light of this scenario, the NTSB flight path was probably created by someone who tried to "average" the controller's versions. This must have </span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)">happened weeks, months, or years after the attacks.</span><br /><br /><br /></span>
