		<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >Since 2002, when Jared Israel was the first one to point out the lame reaction of the US air defense to the hijackings (not being able to intercept leastwise one of the airliners), there's still no satisfying answer to the question for those who were responsible for the fatal delays.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >The 9/11 Commission basically argues that the existing protocol for the collaboration between the FAA and NORAD in the case of a hijacking was "unsuited in every respect" because it was  designed for "traditional hijackings" rather than suicide terrorists using hijacked planes as missiles.  The Commission Report describes meticulously how the information "Flight X is hijacked" was ought to be processed from the basic FAA controller who spots the plane, upward the FAA hierarchy to the "hijack coordinator" who contacts the NMCC (National Military Command Center), and - after seeking approval from the Secretary of Defense - down the NORAD chain of command.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >There is an entire section on this subject ("Interagency collaboration", p. 17/18), which is copied word by word from the Commission's <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2004_rpt/staff_statement_17.pdf">Staff Statement No. 17</a>, a working paper from June 2004, with one remarkable exception. The sentence "<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Most FAA centers had a civilian employee to coordinate with NORAD, for situations like training exercises</span>", which is written down in the statement, didn't manage it into the final report.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >It should have, however. On 9/11, these civilian employees, also known as "military liaisons", were in direct contact to the NEADS air defenders. So the regional FAA Centers were by all means able to shortcut the intricate protocol by simply telling their own military liaison to call up NEADS. And this is exactly what happened:</span><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >Flight..................................................11.........175.........77.........93</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >Controller realizes flight is hijacked.......8:25.......8:55.......----........9:32</span> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" ><br />Notification of NEADS.........................8:37.......9:03.......----.......10:07</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >Delay in minutes..................................12...........8..........----.........35</span><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >While 8 or 12 minutes look to be a reasonable time for controllers to figure out the situation, discuss various options and get clearance from higher-ranking FAA managers, the outstanding 35 minutes delay for Flight 93 requires a closer look at Cleveland Center, the facility responsible for Flight 93. (Flight 77 is a special case because it was not believed to be hijacked, but missed; it completely vanished from the radar scopes of FAA controllers.)</span><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >The "Flight 93 is a hijack with a bomb on board" information needed only two minutes from the basic controller to FAA headquarters:<br /></span>
		<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >
			<blockquote><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">At 9:32, a third radio transmission came over the frequency: "Keep  remaining sitting. We have a bomb on board." The controller understood,  but chose to respond: "Calling Cleveland Center, you're unreadable. Say  again, slowly." He notified his supervisor, who passed the notice up the  chain of command. By 9:34, word of the hijacking had reached FAA  headquarters. </span>(911 CR, p. 28)</span><br /></blockquote>
			However: NEADS first received a call about United 93 from the military liaison at Cleveland Center at 10:07. We know his name from transcripts of <!--<a href="http://www.911myths.com/images/f/f4/Team8_Box20_Trip-2of3-NEADS-CDs.pdf">--><a href="FILES/Team8_Box20_Trip-2of3-NEADS-CDs.pdf">NEADS radio messages</a>: that was Mr. Dukelin - first name unknown. Dukelin was in direct contact to Stacia Rountree from NEADS, he spoke with her at 9:45 and again at 10:00. At both occasions, he alerted her to Delta 1989 - but not one single word on United 93.<br /><br />
		</span>
		<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >Did Dukelin not know about the hijacking of Flight 93? This can be precluded. He was certainly in contact with the Traffic Management Unit and Ed Wolbers, the operations manager:<br /></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" ></span>
		<blockquote  style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0); font-weight: bold;font-family:arial;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:85%;" >They are speaking to the pilot, Dukelin talks to Ed and tells him he is talking to HUNTRESS. Ed says D1989 is not being hijacked, he is landing as a precaution in Cleveland.</span></blockquote>
		<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >So Dukelin, like the Cleveland Center management, was certainly aware of the Flight 93 problem. Maybe he was eagerly waiting for an order from above to inform NEADS:</span><br />
		<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >
			<blockquote><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cleveland even told the Command Center [at 9:36] it was prepared to contact a  nearby military base to make the request. The Command Center told  Cleveland that FAA personnel well above them in the chain of command had  to make the decision to seek military assistance and were working on  the issue. </span>(911 CR, p. 28/29)</span><br /></blockquote>
			But the upper FAA management shied away from requesting the help of NEADS:
		</span>
		<br />
		<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >
			<blockquote><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">At 9:49, 13 minutes after Cleveland Center had asked about getting  military help, the Command Center suggested that someone at headquarters  should decide whether to request military assistance:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">FAA Headquarters: They're pulling Jeff away to go talk about United 93.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Command Center: Uh, do we want to think, uh, about scrambling aircraft?</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">FAA Headquarters: Oh, God, I don't know.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Command Center: Uh, that's a decision somebody's gonna have to make probably in the next ten minutes.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">FAA Headquarters: Uh, ya know everybody just left the room.</span><br />(911 CR, p. 29)</span><br /></blockquote>
			Everybody left the room. The Headquarters and the Command Center were tracking Flight 93 as it turned around and headed toward Washington. They got the information that it was hijacked and had a bomb on board. They knew that two airliners had <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >already </span>been used as guided missiles  - <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">yet nobody of the leading FAA personnel bothered to follow Cleveland Center's suggestion and tell NEADS (via Dukelin) to scramble fighters.</span>
		</span>
		<span style="font-family:arial;">What was going on there?</span><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >Additionally, at 9:45 the FAA issued the general grounding order for all aircraft. Who ordered it? The official story has it that it was Ben Sliney, director of the Command Center, but there are also <a href="http://www.slate.com/?id=2063935">reports</a> that it was Monte Belger, deputy director of the Headquarters - not to forget that Norman Mineta claims the glory for himself. No matter who was it - why did this hero make the risky, unprecedented, precautionary decision to "get all the birds down", but failed to make the acute, urgent, if well-rehearsed and operationally easy decision to alert NEADS about a hijacked airliner on his way to Washington with a bomb on board?</span><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >There seems to be only one realistic recourse: <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Flight 93 was part of a military exercise, probably a hijack simulation, and the exercise plot included a delayed alerting of NEADS. </span>The behavior of Belger, Sliney &amp; co. indicates that they didn't view the plane as a threat, but were told (possibly from the Secret Service who -<a href="http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/011805_simplify_case.shtml#bullmeans"> </a></span><a style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);" href="http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/011805_simplify_case.shtml#bullmeans"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-family:arial;" >according to Mike Ruppert</span></a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" > - had direct access to FAA data) that it was a "special", i.e. a military exercise flight. The purpose of the delayed alert might have been to test NEADS - to make it more difficult for them to intercept the flight in time.<br /><br /></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >To substantiate this thesis, I take a look at the function of the so-called military liaisons. I've already mentioned that the 9/11 Commission describes their job as "to coordinate with NORAD, for situations like training exercises". An <a href="http://www.woodybox.info/91_Hayley_thesis.pdf">analysis paper from 2001</a>, examining the structure of Air Traffic Control, confirms that the military liaisons dealt with exercises. Moreover it looks that the exercises were the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">only</span> job of the liaisons.</span><br />
		<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >
			<blockquote style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size:85%;">Military Coordinator: coordinates paper work and flight data for all military exercises within Boston Center airspace.</span></blockquote>
			This certainly applies to the other FAA Centers as well. Also  <a href="http://www.navybmr.com/AC/study%20material/76104smo.pdf">FAA directive 7610.4K</a> ("Special Military Operations") shows up the central role of the military liaisons for the exercises:<br />

		<blockquote style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;font-size:85%;"  >FAA Military Liaison Officers&#8217; Responsibilities</span><span style="font-size:85%;"><br /><br /></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;font-size:85%;"  >1&#8722;6&#8722;1.

Recommend the use of planning conferences to mission planning officers for the resolution of problems when it is evident that the exercise requirements will generate sufficient traffic to create untenable air traffic or airspace user situations.c. Provide early notification and information to the affected ARTCCs and CARF on any exercises which are classified under subparagraph b.</span></blockquote>
		<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >So by dropping the "military liaisons" from the final report, the Commission avoided questions about their function. Their function was to coordinate military exercises with civilian air traffic. It was not to assist the FAA in the case of a hijacking.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" > Interestingly, there is an interview with the military liaison of Boston Center, Colin Scoggins (as his alias "Cheap Shot"):</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" ></span>
		<blockquote style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;font-size:85%;"  >As the military specialist I am responsible for all military procedures between Boston Center and the military units in my airspace, and any visiting military units that participate in any of our Special Use Airspace (SUA).</span></blockquote>

		<blockquote><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;font-family:arial;font-size:85%;"  >Q:  What can you tell about the military exercises of that day, and if they had any effect whatsoever on the response?</span><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:85%;" ><br /><br /></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;font-family:arial;font-size:85%;"  >Cheap Shot:  I never knew anything about them.  Vigilant Guardian is an exercise that we don&#8217;t participate at Boston Center.  We normally are involved in Fertile Spades, Fertile Angels, and Amalgam Virgo&#8217;s.  Occasionally we will get involved in large-scale exercises such as a while back Amalgam Warrior, and Global Yankee.</span><br /></blockquote>
		<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/911guide/cs3"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-family:arial;" >http://sites.google.com/site/911guide/cs3</span></a><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >"Cheap Shot" denies any knowledge of or involvement in the ongoing exercises. This comes as a big surprise, because NORAD was conducting several large-scale exercises, Vigilant Guardian being only one of them. Other exercises, not mentioned by Scoggins, were Global Guardian, Northern Guardian, or Vigilant Warrior. NORAD covers the entire airspace of Boston Center. When Boston Center called NEADS, the air defenders thought it was the begin of Vigilant Guardian. Scoggins' "I never knew" claim would imply that NORAD conducted its exercises in Boston Center airspace without any coordination with civilian air traffic control - bypassing Scoggins, the scheduled coordinator.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >This is hard to believe and entails the search for an alternative explanation. Here is one: Scoggins was involved in the exercises, but to admit this fact would have opened the doors for more gnawing questions. Many suspect Scoggins of being a gatekeeper, and the job of a gatekeeper is to absorb dangerous questions. This is exactly what he's doing.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >A military liaison was not only assigned to the FAA field facilities, but to the Command Center and the Headquarters, too. There is little information available for the latter. The military liaison at the Command Center was the "Air Traffic Services Cell", consisting of Col. John Czabaranek,  Lt. Col. Michael-Anne Cherry and Maj. Kevin Bridges. Mike Williams of 911myths.com </span><a href="http://www.911myths.com/index.php/Military_liaisons"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-family:arial;" >speculates</span></a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" > that the job of the "cell" on 9/11 was to help with the communication infrastructure (teleconferences etc.)</span>:<br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" ></span>
		<blockquote style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;font-size:85%;"  >From this description the cell officers earliest task appears to have  been to set up the various teleconferences.  They were assisting with  communications in general, and there's nothing here to say the officers  would take it upon themselves to monitor FAA information and pass it on  to NORAD, especially if they believed (like Sliney) NORAD had already  been informed.  It wasn't their job, and they had other things to do.</span></blockquote>

		<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >On 9/11, there was no tension, warfare, natural disaster or civil unrest, leaving the "military training exercise support" as the residual task of the "cell". This is confirmed by an article of </span><a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/592509/posts"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-family:arial;" >Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology</span></a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" > from December 2001, describing the job of the cell as "refresher training", i.e. conducting exercises:</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" ></span>
		<blockquote style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;font-size:85%;"  >In a fluke, so was what Herndon calls "the military cell"--the Air  Traffic Services Cell, created by the FAA and the Defense Dept. for use  when needed to coordinate priority aircraft movement during warfare or  emergencies. The Pentagon staffs it only three days per month for  refresher training, but Sept. 11 happened to be one of those days.</span></blockquote>
		<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >It is unclear if the Air Traffic Services Cell was in direct contact to the military liaisons at the FAA field facilities, but there is reason to assume that. The cell was able to communicate with other military facilities via SIPRNET, the military's Internet:</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" ></span>
		<blockquote style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;font-size:85%;"  >The ATSC&#8217;s response to the terrorist attacks benefits from the fact  that, six weeks earlier, the cell had a secure terminal to access the SIPRNET&#8212;the  military&#8217;s classified version of the Internet&#8212;installed, along with  other hardware, which significantly enhances the movement of vital  information. According to Meenan, because the cell has the SIPRNET terminal, &#8220;we could immediately look at NORAD and [Defense Department]  plans as they evolved; filter, package, and format them, then walk out  to the [FAA] national operations manager&#8212;who had control of the entire  national airspace system&#8212;and give him current visibility into&#8230; fighter,  tanker, and support aircraft activities. It cut down our response time  tremendously.&#8221;</span></blockquote>

Instead, SIPRNET seems to have been the central tool to conduct the various exercises. Moreover, it was a valuable tool for "interested circles"  to make the exercises a springboard for performing the 9/11 crimes.</span>
