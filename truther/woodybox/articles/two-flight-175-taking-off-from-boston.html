		<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" >My personal 9/11 researcher "career" started with the detection of a duplicated "Flight 11" at Boston Logan Airport: one departing from Terminal B, Gate 32, at 7:45, the other one from Terminal B, Gate 26, somewhat later because the departure was delayed:</span><br><br>

		<a href="twin-11-mod.html"><span style="font-family:arial;" >Flight 11 - The Twin Flight</span></a><br><br>

		<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" >As opposed to that, the gate departure of United Airlines 175 is indisputable: </span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)font-family:arial;" >7:58 a.m.</span>

		<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" >, which is also confirmed by the database of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS):</span><br /><br /><a href="http://www.bts.gov/xml/ontimesummarystatistics/src/dstat/OntimeSummaryDepatures.xml"><span style="font-family:arial;" >http://www.bts.gov/xml/ontimesummarystatistics/src/dstat/OntimeSummaryDepatures.xml</span><br /></a><br />

		<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" >However, the BTS database reveals a strange discrepancy regarding the "wheels-off time" of Flight 175 - i.e. the moment when the plane lifted off from the runway. The BTS notes a wheels-off time of </span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)font-family:arial;" >8:23</span>

		<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" >, which differs distinctly from the "official" wheels-off time, which is </span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)font-family:arial;" >8:14</span>

		<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" >.</span><br /><br />

		<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" >This <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">8:14</span> take-off is confirmed by the ATC/pilot radio transcript and various radar data. So what about the <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">8:23</span>? How was this datum being generated?</span><br /><br />

		<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" >The wheels-off time of is triggered automatically by a mechanical switcher when the plane loses contact to the ground. The data are sent automatically to the airline via ACARS, and the airline forwards them to the BTS on a regular base. So apparently no human failure is possible. The fact that the gate departure 7:58 coincides with the official story suggests that the data are valid.<br /></span><br />

		<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" >Being familiar with the duplication of Flight 11 at Logan Airport as well as the duplication of Delta 1989 at Cleveland Hopkins Airport, I arrived at the inevitable conclusion that this was another case of a duplicated plane - i.e. a "Flight 175" taking off at <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">8:14</span> </span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)font-family:arial;" >and</span>

		<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" > another "Flight 175" taking off at <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">8:23</span>. However, there was no independent confirmation, so I hinted at the discrepancy on occasion, but always added a question mark -here, for instance:</span><br /><br /><a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/forum//index.php?showtopic=29">

			<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" >I am now able to proudly present an eyewitness for the <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">8:23</span> wheels-offtime of Flight 175: Steven Miller, US Airways pilot, who was next in line behind Flight 175 to take off from the runway:</span><br /><br /><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,102);font-family:arial;" >On the taxi-out in Boston, they ((the pilots of US Airways 6805)) waited at the runway's hold-short line, where Miller looked up to watch a United Boeing 767 take off, United Flight 175.</span><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,102);font-family:arial;" > The final weight and balance calculations from dispatch came over the ACARS at 8:05, and with that in hand, the crew was ready to fly. Wide-body aircraft produce especially powerful wingtip vortices - horizontal, tornado-like winds off the ends of the wings - which require time to dissipate before other aircraft can take off, so he waited the required three minutes after United 175 departed before he received his takeoff clearance.</span><br /><br />

		<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" >(Lynn Spencer, "Touching History", p. 58)</span><br /><br />

		<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" >A quick check with the BTS database reveals that USA 6805 had a wheels-off time of </span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)font-family:arial;" >8:28</span>

		<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" >. Miller explicitly describes that he waited 3 minutes before getting takeoff clearance; adding a little bit for the timespan between takeoff clearance and actual wheels-off, Flight 175 must have lifted off the runway around </span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)font-family:arial;" >8:23-8:24</span>

		<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" >. It is out of the question that Miller observed a plane that took off at </span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)font-family:arial;" >8:14</span>

		<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" >.</span><br /><br />

		<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" >Did Miller maybe see a different United plane? Very unlikely. Searching the BTS database for other United Boeing 767's delivers no results for the relevant time. There is a very slim possibility that a non-domestic United Boeing 767 took of just then, because the BTS database lists only domestic flights. However, Miller himself says it was Flight 175; so either he overheard the flight number when taxiing out, or, as someone who was frequently flying from Logan (as he says) he was familiar with the wide-body planes departing at that time.</span><br /><br />

		<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" >The BTS database also reveals that the tail number of the plane that took off at </span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)font-family:arial;" >8:23</span>

		<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" > was N612UA. This was United Airlines Flight 175. And there is no proof that the plane that took off at </span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)font-family:arial;" >8:14</span>

		<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial;" > was indeed N612UA, leading to the conclusion that the pilot only pretended to fly United Airlines Flight 175.<br /><br /><br /></span>
