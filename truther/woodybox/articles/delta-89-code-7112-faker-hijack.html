		<span style="font-family:arial;">The NORAD tapes are proof: Delta 89 was <em>not</em> Delta 1989.</span></strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong></strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong></strong></span>
		<p><span style="font-family:arial;"></span></p>
		<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial;">Three minutes after the Pentagon was hit, a strange aircraft with call sign "Delta 89" popped up on the radar screens of air defense commander Kevin Nasypany's crew. It signaled a hijacking and was tracked by NEADS for three minutes before it suddenly disappeared again.<br /><br />In the official story, Delta 89 doesn't exist. Better to say, for the 9/11 Commission as well as authors </span><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2006/08/norad200608"><span style="font-family:arial;">Michael Bronner</span></a><span style="font-family:arial;"> and Lynn Spencer ("Touching History"), the plane tracked by NEADS as Delta 89 was in fact Delta <em>1989, </em>i.e. a case of sloppy communication.<br /><br />This, however, is impossible. It is easy to show that, apart from the different call sign, Delta 89's transponder code, flight plan and flight path differed from Delta 1989. The evidence is present on the NORAD tapes, a source of impeccable authenticity because you can virtually look over the shoulder of NEADS technicians while they're tracking Delta 89 on their displays. </span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;color:#000000;">To demonstrate why Delta 89 was not identical with Delta 1989, I will go through the NORAD tapes step by step and comment on them. But before starting the analysis, we need to get a rough understanding how NEADS radar works - it's quite different from the FAA radar. Lynn Spencer explains in her book "Touching History" (p.32): </span><span style="color:#000066;"><br /><br /></span><span style="color:#000066;"></span><span style="color:#000066;"></span>
		<blockquote>
			<p><span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="color:#000066;">Slow and cumbersome, and not nearly as user friendly as more modern equipment, the NEADS monochromic radar displays are not designed to take internal FAA radar data or to identify radar tracks originating from inside the United States. The system offers little, if any, such low-level coverage over the country.<br />...<br />Their radar scopes are filled with hundreds of radar returns not just from aircraft but from weather systems, ground interference. and what's called anomalous propagation - false returns caused by conditions in the atmosphere, or by such obstruction as flocks of birds.</span> </span></p>
		</blockquote>
		<span style="color:#000066;"><span style="font-family:arial;color:#000000;">So the NEADS radar screen is filled with countless radar blips from planes - without the identifying data block common to FAA radar, however - as well as irregular radar returns. Only on special occasions like emergency cases, a plane's blip is highlighted and provided with a data tag. Lynn Spencer (p. 25/26): </span><span style="color:#000066;"><br /><br /></span></span><span style="color:#000066;"><span style="color:#000066;"></span></span><span style="color:#000066;"><span style="color:#000066;"></span></span>
		<span style="color:#000066;">
			<blockquote><span style="font-family:arial;">Pilots have three special transponder codes that they can dial in: 7500 for hijacking, 7600 for loss of radio, and 7700 for other emergencies. Any of them will cause the airplane's tag to light up on his radar screen, but he doesn't see any such tag.</span>
		</span>
		</blockquote><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial;">Now we are ready to start with the analysis. The complete transcripts are </span><a href="http://911woodybox.blogspot.com/2009/06/neads-transcript-on-delta-89.html"><span style="font-family:arial;">here</span></a><span style="font-family:arial;">. It is highly recommended to listen to the original audio file of the following channels (scroll forward to the respective time):</span></span><span style="font-family:arial;"><br /></span><br /><a href="http://www.erpn.org/911-NORAD-TAPES/DRM1%20DAT2%20Channel%204%20ID%20Op.wav"><span style="font-family:arial;">Channel 4, 1:14:00</span></a><span style="font-family:arial;"><br /></span><br /><a href="http://www.erpn.org/911-NORAD-TAPES/DRM1%20DAT2%20Channel%207%20ID2%20OP.wav"><span style="font-family:arial;">Channel 7, 1:09:00</span></a><span style="font-family:arial;"><br /><br /></span><a href="http://www.erpn.org/911-NORAD-TAPES/DRM1%20DAT2%20Channel%2021%20TT%20Op.wav"><span style="font-family:arial;">Channel 21, 1:09:00</span></a><span style="font-family:arial;"><br /><br /></span>

		</blockquote>
		</span></span></span>
		<p></p>
		<span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="color:#000000;">90 seconds before Delta 89 appears on stage, NEADS receives a verbal message from Colin Scoggins, the military liaison controller at Boston Center, regarding Delta 1989. The message is affirmed with professional calm. NEADS knows now that one of the many anonymous radar blips near Cleveland is a possible hijack. Note that Scoggins is wrong on the destination of Delta 1989: that was Los Angeles, not Las Vegas.</span><br /><br /></span>
		<blockquote>
			<span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="color:#000066;">(Channel 4)<br /></span><br /></span>

Another one - same place - Las Vegas</span></p>
		</blockquote>
		<span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="color:#000000;">In striking contrast to Delta 1989, the appearance of Delta 89 causes big excitement among the NEADS crew. It is echoed through all of the channels. Lynn Spencer interprets this passage as a prompt reaction to Scoggins's message, but there are several reasons why this cannot be the case:<br /><br />- the different call sign: needless to say, transmitting the correct call sign of an aircraft is an absolute must in aeronautic communication. No air traffic controller would ever get the idea to abbreviate a flight number by omitting the first two digits because that will automatically lead to massive confusion.<br /><br />- "<em>we have a code on him now</em>" - obviously, the plane has squawked a special emergency code that causes its blip to lighten up on the NEADS radar displays - just as explained above. This is immediately noticed by the NEADS crew and leads to their excited reactions. The data tag informs them about the call sign (Delta 89), the flight plan (Boston-Las Vegas), the type of the plane (Boeing 767) and the cause of the emergency: a hijacking.</span><br /><br /></span><span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="color:#000000;">- "<em>Another one - same place - Las Vegas</em>" - NEADS is already aware of Delta 1989 which was reported 90 seconds ago by Colin Scoggins. Now Delta 89 - "another one" - appears in the same vicinity. So NEADS does <strong><em>not</em></strong> identify Delta 89 with Delta 1989, but views it as a different plane.<br /></span><span style="color:#000000;"></span><br /><span style="color:#000000;">Bottom line: Delta 89's blip suddenly flashes on the NEADS screens - making it easy to follow - and indicates a hijacking. In contrast, Delta 1989's blip is not spotted yet.</span> </span><span style="color:#000066;"><br /><br /></span><span style="color:#000066;"></span><span style="color:#000066;"></span>
		<blockquote>

		</blockquote>
		<span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="color:#000000;">To understand what's going on here, I cite Lynn Spencer again (p. 32):</span><br /><br /></span>
		<blockquote><span style="font-family:arial;color:#000066;">To identify American 11, the surveillance and ID techs must go through a grueling process. (...) The technicians must first determine which radar data on their screens is for aircraft, which they do by monitoring its movement, which is distinctive for planes. The technician must observe for at least 36 seconds to a minute just to confirm that a blip is in fact an aircraft track. The tech must attach what's called a tactical display number to it, which tells the computer to start tracking and identifying the target. If the target is in fact a plane, then over a period of 12-20 seconds, the computer will start to generate information on the track: heading, speed, latitude, longitude, and the identifying information being transmitted by the transponder. </span></blockquote>
		<span style="font-family:arial;color:#000000;">The NEADS technicians start a "search" for Delta 89, described by Lynn Spencer as a grueling process. But in contrast to American 11, which had turned the transponder off, Delta 89 is tagged, enabling them to curtail the procedure. In the course of the search, they detect <strong>two</strong> <strong>planes</strong> "<em>really close together</em>" - Delta 89 and Delta 1989 -, and obtain the squawk code of one of them: <strong>7112</strong>. This is not Delta 1989's code, which is <strong>1304,</strong> so it must be the code of Delta 89. The first digit "7" indicates that it's not the ID code of an usual civilian airliner - they never begin with a 7. Instead, the 7 is reserved for emergency cases like 7500, 7600, or 7700. By squawking 7112, Delta 89 manages to pop up on the NEADS radar screens and signals a hijacking. </span><span style="color:#000066;"><br /><br /></span><span style="color:#000066;"></span><span style="color:#000066;"></span>

		</span>
		<br /><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial;">Now NEADS contacts Indianapolis Center to inform them that Delta 89 is heading for their airspace. This is evidence that Delta 89 is flying <strong>southwest- or southbound</strong> at that point because the boundary to Indianapolis Center runs 40 miles south of Cleveland. In contrast, Delta 1989 never goes south, and especially at 9:43, it is flying <strong>westbound</strong> (direction 285) according to the </span><a href="http://aal77.com/faa/faa_atc/zob/2%20AWA%202%20Accident%20Package%20ZOB-ARTCC-287%20UAL93%20REDACT.pdf"><span style="font-family:arial;">Cleveland Center/Delta 1989 transcript</span></a><span style="font-family:arial;">:</span></span><span style="font-family:arial;"><br /><br /></span>

		</blockquote>
		<span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="color:#000000;">The next radio transmission between Cleveland Center and Delta 1989 occurs at 9:44. In between, there is no order to change the direction, which is proof that Delta 1989 is <strong>not</strong> heading towards Indianapolis Center at 9:43 like Delta 89 (according to Stacia Rountree from NEADS).</span><br /><span style="color:#000000;"></span><br /><span style="color:#000000;">Back to NEADS:</span><br /><br /></span>

		</blockquote>
		<span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="color:#000000;">At 9:44, Delta 89 is suddenly "lost". NEADS doesn't know where it's gone and is unable to track it. Obviously the pilot has turned off the transponder, making himself virtually invisible. The radar technicians resume the search. At 9:46:25, they are able to identify an eligible blip, but it's Delta 1989 this time. Their comment: "<em>that's not the guy then</em>" - the 7112 guy they lost and were looking for. </span><br /><br /></span>
		<p><span style="font-family:arial;color:#000000;">Now it's time to sum up the data: </span></p>
		<p><br /><span style="color:#333300;"><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">Call sign.................Delta 1989.......................Delta 89<br /><br />Flight plan..............Boston-Los Angeles.........Boston-Las Vegas<br /><br />Squawk code..........1304.................................7112<br /><br />Direction at 9:43......westbound......................southwest/southbound<br /><br />Transponder............continously working..........turned off at 9:44<br /></span></span><br /></p>
		<span style="color:#000000;"></span><span style="color:#000000;"></span><br /><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial;">Did the 9/11 Commission overlook these discrepancies? Unlikely. Did Commission staffers not check Channel 21 with the "code 7112" message? Oh yes, they did! On January 23, 2004, Miles Kara, Kevin Schaeffer, and Geoffrey Brown interviewed </span><a href="http://media.nara.gov/9-11/MFR/t-0148-911MFR-00772.pdf"><span style="font-family:arial;">Sgt. Susan Marie Rose</span></a><span style="font-family:arial;">, whose voice is recorded on Channel 21 as she spots "code 7112":</span></span><span style="font-family:arial;color:#000066;"> </span><span style="color:#000066;"><br /></span><span style="color:#000066;"></span>
		<blockquote>
			<span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="color:#000066;">Commission staff asked Rose is she recalled details on tracking Delta Airlines Flight 1989 or United Airlines Flight 93 (UAL 93). She replied that she and LaMarche tracked a specific suspected hijack that they believe was flight planned from Boston to Las Vegas through Cleveland and Minneapolis Center airspace. This flight, she believed, was headed to a specific airport, and he was maneuvering to turn into the airport to land.</span><br /></span>
			<p><span style="font-family:arial;color:#000066;">Rose noted that she is uncertain whether the aircraft reflected in Commision staff's recording was one that was search only or one that was a mode three. <strong>She surmised there being two aircraft that they followed based on listening to the tapes</strong> in which she pointed out a mode three squawking code 1304.</span></p>
		</blockquote>
		<span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="color:#000000;">The "surmise" of Susan Marie Rose is certainly correct, but squawk code 7112, evidence for a second plane, is simply omitted in the report. Miles Kara and his colleagues don't seem to be interested in this other aircraft, despite the strange code and the fact that it was considered a hijacking. Code 7112 and Delta 89 were simply glossed over.</span><br /><br /></span>
		<p><span style="font-family:arial;color:#000000;">The NORAD tapes belong to the most authentic sources for the events of 9/11, and they are certainly not faked, as everyone will attest who has listened to them. As matters stand, the tapes provide watertight proof that <strong>Delta 89 was NOT Delta 1989</strong>, Delta 89 being defined as the aircraft that was tracked by NEADS between 9:41 and 9:44.</span></p>
		<span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="color:#000000;">The analysis must not stop at this point. What kind of plane was this Delta 89? Discarding exotic scenarios like a drunken pilot or a foreign intruder playing games with the air defense, the plane's known attributes allow only one reasonable explanation - Delta 89 was a simulated hijacking as part of a military exercise:</span><br /><br /></span>
		<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial;">- "Delta 89" was a fake call sign. The regular Delta Airlines Flight 89 was sitting at JFK airport and scheduled to depart for Los Angeles at 3:00 p.m.</span></p>
		</span><span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="color:#000000;">- The behavior of Delta 89 reminds of a hide-and-seek game. To facilitate the catcher's job, it left its cover and "cuckooed" for three minutes before disappearing in the dark again. Note that military exercises are often termed "war games".</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#000000;">- Delta 89 didn't squawk 7500, the emergency code for a "real world" hijacking, but another irregular code - 7112 - that was immediately interpreted as a hijacking by NEADS technicians. </span><br /><br /><span style="color:#000000;">- According to FAA directive 7110.65, certain beacon codes are regularly assigned to planes taking part in NORAD exercises - "7112" seems to have been one of them:</span><span style="color:#000066;"><span style="color:#000066;"><span style="color:#000066;"><span style="color:#000066;"> </span></span></span></span></span><span style="color:#000066;"><span style="color:#000066;"><span style="color:#000066;"><span style="color:#000066;"><br /><br /></span></span></span></span><span style="color:#000066;"><span style="color:#000066;"><span style="color:#000066;"><span style="color:#000066;"></span></span></span></span>

		<span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="color:#000000;">Delta 89 fulfills all conditions for an "exercise faker aircraft" whose job was to simulate a hijacking. Alternative explanations are hard to imagine. Therefore it's time now to establish the central thesis of this text: <strong>Delta 89 was a faker hijack exercise.</strong> </span><br /><br /></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial;">So what - the interested reader might ask - what impact has this insight on the official story of the 9/11 attacks? Indeed, Michael Ruppert has already pointed out the existence of at least one "live-fly exercise" (with real aircraft involved) in his book <em>Crossing the Rubicon.</em> Lynn Spencer notes: "Today's training exercise runs a number of scenarios, including a simulated hijacking in which the perpetrators overtake an aircraft for political purposes, directing it to an island in order to seek asylum". (p.24) So is the case of "Exercise Delta 89" important at all?<br /><br />Yes, it is, because of Delta 1989, which was kind of a "doppelganger" plane with nearly identical call sign (promptly leading to confusion), identical aircraft type (Boeing 767), identical origin airport (Boston), and flying in close vicinity when Delta 89 exposed itself at 9:41. Clearly the designation "Delta 89" was carefully chosen by the wargame designers to create a mix-up with Delta 1989. This is the first indication that the ongoing exercises interfered with regular civilian air traffic.<br /><br />In other words: Delta 1989, in spite of being a regular airliner, played a peripheral role in the exercise. It served as a cover-up for Delta 89. At first, NEADS was alerted by Delta 89, and when this plane stopped squawking and disappeared, the attention shifted to Delta 1989, which was closely observed until its landing in Cleveland.<br /><br />Half an hour after Delta 1989, another mysterious airliner in distress landed at </span><a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_911_26.htm"><span style="font-family:arial;">Cleveland Airport.</span></a><span style="font-family:arial;"> Just like Delta 89, its existence seems to have been covered up through "merging" it with Delta 1989 - a doppelganger case again. This naturally leads to the question whether the eerie Cleveland plane was identical to Delta 89. Indeed, there are surprising congruences:<br /><br />- Both planes were reportedly a 767<br />- Both planes were reportedly coming from Boston<br />- Both planes were suspected of being hijacked<br />- Both planes were covered up by Delta 1989</span></span><span style="font-family:arial;"><br /><br /><span style="color:#000000;">These coincidences allow the formulation of the working hypothesis that <strong>Delta 89 and the Cleveland mystery plane are identical.</strong> Confirmation pending.</span><br /><br /></span>
