		<br />--><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >This short piece is an update of my most popular article so far, "The Cleveland Airport Mystery" from 2004, prominently featured in "Crossing the Rubicon" by Michael Ruppert and "Loose Change, 2. edition" by Dylan Avery.</span>
		<br />
		<br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >I examined the circumstances of the landing of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delta 1989</span>, a Boeing 767 out of Boston,  at Cleveland Hopkins Airport on 9/11. I was lucky to find so much evidence for the existence of a shadowy doppelganger flight of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delta 1989</span> - landing at about the same time and likewise being evacuated - that I published the results <a href="http://911review.org/inn.globalfreepress/Cleveland_Airport_Mystery.html">here</a>.</span>
		<br />
		<br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >Unfortunately, many people think the central thesis of the article is that United 93 was the mysterious plane that  landed at Cleveland Airport. This ist not true. I never claimed that United 93 landed at Cleveland. For more background, look <a href="http://911woodybox.blogspot.com/2007/02/cleveland-airport-mystery.html">here</a>.</span>
		<br />
		<br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >I claimed, however, and do continue to claim that an unidentified Boeing 767 landed  at Cleveland in emergency and was evacuated, with <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delta 1989</span> serving as a cover, i. e. whoever asked for the identity of the mysterious plane afterwards reaped the answer: that was <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delta 1989</span>! and stopped asking questions.</span>
		<br />
		<br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >In 2009, numerous documents of the 9/11 Commission came to light. There I found a perfect candidate for the eerie double of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delta 1989</span> - <span style="font-weight: bold;">United 1898</span> - and published it <a href="http://911woodybox.blogspot.com/2009/03/united-1898-cleveland-airport-mystery.html">here</a>.</span>
		<br />
		<br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >In summary, <span style="font-weight: bold;">United 1898</span> is a most interesting case because Cleveland controllers reported it to a special unit of the FAA, named "AAT-200", which is dealing with accidents, emergency cases and other irregularities. However, on 9/11/2001 United Airlines operated no aircraft with flight number 1898. Together with the salient similarity of the flight number (1989/1898) this makes  <span style="font-weight: bold;">United 1898</span> a good candidate for "Flight X" and an interesting matter of investigation.</span>
		<br />
		<br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >Two years later, I'm now proud to present an independent verification for the emergency landing of a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Flight 1898</span> at Cleveland. This time it's called <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delta 1898</span>.</span>

		<br />
		<br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >In this internal FAA timeline, there is only one entry for <span style="font-weight: bold;">DAL1898</span>. Note that this is definitely no typo because <span style="font-weight: bold;">DAL1898</span> was a confirmed hijacking, whereas <span style="font-weight: bold;">DAL1989</span> (= <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delta 1989</span>) was never suspected a hijack, neither earlier nor later than the security warning of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delta 1898</span>.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" > It should be of no big surprise by now that this so-called <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delta 1898 </span>was not the <span style="font-style: italic;">official</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delta</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Flight 1898</span> who was scheduled to depart from Salt Lake City in the afternoon, but - of course - never left the ground on that day.</span>
		<br />
		<br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >So <span style="font-weight: bold;">United 1898</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delta 1898</span> were both fake flight numbers. The identity of the numbers and the similar context (<span style="font-weight: bold;">United 1898</span> was an emergency case; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delta 1898 </span>was a confirmed hijacking) leads straightforwardly to the conclusion that these two planes were one and the same. The close similarity of the flight numbers 1898 and 1989 corroborates the thesis that <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delta 1989</span> functioned as a cover-up for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Flight 1898</span>. The plane was probably evacuated as <span style="font-weight: bold;">United 1898</span>, was quickly renamed <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delta 1898</span>, and fell into oblivion due to the informational cover provided by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delta 1989. </span></span>
		<br />
		<br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >This very much reminds a shell game, with the shells bearing fake flight numbers. And the only entity entitled to legally use fake flight numbers was the military in case of conducting a war game, i.e. an exercise. It appears that the emergency landing of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Flight 1898</span> and its subsequent evacuation was indeed part of a military exercise. This may be the reason why it's so difficult to obtain information about the incident: military secrecy.</span>
		<br />
		<br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:arial;" >Combined with the information already presented in my original article, there is now ample evidence that <span style="font-weight: bold;">Flight 1898</span> was a Boeing 767 of United Airlines coming from Boston - but it was not the <span style="font-style: italic;">regular </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">United 1898</span>. The number of the United Boeing 767's departing from Boston is so small that it should narrow down the search for the identity of the mysterious plane considerably. <a href="http://911woodybox.blogspot.com/2009/11/mysterious-united-177-from-boston.html">United 177</a> looks like a good candidate.</span>
