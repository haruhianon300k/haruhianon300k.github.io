		<p><b>Strange encounter at Newark Airport</b></p>

		<p>On 9/11, Anthony F. Mazza was working at Newark Airport as a fueler. One of the planes he provided with fuel was United 93. In the cockpit of the plane, he met a person who was apparently neither Leroy Homer, jr, the co-pilot, nor Jason Dahl, the pilot.</p>

		<p>On Oct. 19, 2001, he was interviewed by the FBI. Here's the FBI report:</p>

		<ul>
			<p><span style="color:#000066;">Mazza has worked as a fueler for Ogden Aviation Services at Newark International Airport since 1973. Mazza fueled United Airlines flight 93 on September 11, 2001 prior to its departure and crash in western Pennsylvania. Mazza stated that everything seemed normal on the flight including the amount of fuel that was pumped into flight 93's tank.</span></p>

			<p><span style="color:#000066;">Mazza stated that prior to the passengers boarding flight 93, he had completed fueling the plane and proceeded to the cockpit to inform the co-pilot of the completed task. This has been the standard operating procedure for United flights out of Newark for many years. <b>Mazza entered the cockpit where he handed the fueling sheet to a young Caucasian male, well groomed, brown hair and a white shirt, who was sitting in the co-pilot's seat.</b> The male responded to Mazza by saying thank you and taking the paper from him. Mazza then departed flight 93 prior to the passengers boarding. Mazza stated that this was approximately 30 minutes prior to the scheduled departure time.</span></p>

			<p><span style="color:#000066;">Mazza was interviewed by FAA employee John Patani shortly after the crash in western Pennsylvania. Mazza stated that he reported that there was nothing unusual on the day of the flight and that the plane had been fueled without incident. </span></p>

			<p><span style="color:#000066;"><b>On Friday, October 12, 2001 Mazza saw a memorial for the crew of flight 93 and saw pictures of the co-pilot of flight 93. The picture was the actual co-pilot of flight 93, who was Leroy Homer.</b> <b>Mazza stated that he was certain that the co-pilot he spoke with was not Mr. Homer.</b></span></p>

			<p><a href="http://www.911myths.com/images/e/ed/Team7_Box12_LeroyHomer.pdf"><i>http://www.911myths.com/images/e/ed/Team7_Box12_LeroyHomer.pdf</i></a></p>
		</ul>


		<p>The FBI report ends here and leaves the reader to itself with the question: who was the "male" in the co-pilot's seat, if not Leroy Homer? Jason Dahl, the pilot? Given Mazza's report, this only "regular" explanation seems to be highly unlikely. After seeing the memorial, Mazza obviously took the initiative to contact the FBI. Had he identified Dahl - whose picture he certainly saw, too - as the "male", he would not have felt compelled to call the FBI.</p>


		<p>When interviewing Mazza, the FBI surely asked him about this possibility and probably showed ihm photos of Dahl again. In any case, the absence of Dahl in the report makes clear that he was not the "male" either. And Dahl was 43, not really a young man like the "male" as described by Mazza.</p>


		<p>Jere Longman ("Among the heroes") describes meticulously the United Airlines routine pre-flight procedures. Before the passengers board a plane, it has to be checked, of course. Basically the captain looks after the cockpit instruments along a pre-flight checklist while the first officer checks the plane outside (tires etc.). The fact that Mazza met neither Dahl nor Homer is even more disturbing than the presence of the "male".</p>

		<p>This looks like another case of plane duplication. It is already known that according to United Airlines ACARS messages, Flight 93 took off at <span class="time">8:28</span>, other than the official take-off time <span class="time">8:42</span>. We have to accustom ourselves to two different "Flight 93" taking off from Newark Airport.</p>
