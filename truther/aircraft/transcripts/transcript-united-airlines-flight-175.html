			<p><b>8:41:07 --</b> USA583: Yea we talked about him on the last frequency we spotted him when he was at our 3 o'clock position. He did appear to us to be at 29,000 feet. We're not picking him up on TCAS. I'll look again and see if we can spot him at 24.</p>
			<p><b>8:40:20 --</b> R42: No, it looks like they shut off their transponder that's why the question about it.</p>

			<p><b>8:42:50 --</b> USA583: Center where do you place him in relation to 583 now?</p>
			<p><b>8:42:55 --</b> R42: He's off about 9 o'clock and about 20 miles looks like he's heading southbound but there's no transponder no nothing and no one's talking to him.</p>
