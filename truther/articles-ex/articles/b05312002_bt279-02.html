			<p>On June 4, 2002, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) will sponsor a multi-agency, bi-national exercise, Amalgam Virgo 02, involving an airborne terrorism scenario over the United States and Canada. The exercise, which was planned prior to the events of Sept. 11, is designed to allow many U.S. and Canadian agencies to test, improve and validate their coordination and operational procedures.</p>

			<p>The exercise does not indicate an increased threat to the domestic airspace of either the United States or Canada.</p>

			<p>Amalgam Virgo is an annual small scale, live-fly exercise sponsored by NORAD. NORAD and other agencies in the United States and Canada that are responsible for homeland security and homeland defense must be prepared for a variety of threats and contingencies. Through exercises like this one, the participating commands and organizations are able to improve preparedness and interagency coordination.</p>

			<p>Approximately 1,500 people will take part in this exercise including members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Transport Canada, the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Vancouver Airport Authority and Delta Air Lines.</p>

			<p>NORAD public affairs is available to provide additional information. They can be reached at (719)554-6889.</p>
