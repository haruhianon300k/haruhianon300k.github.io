			<p>DENVER -- Jets packed with people took off from Oak Harbor, Wash., and Salt Lake City yesterday in a simulated hijacking training exercise designed to improve coordination among American and Canadian agencies.</p>

			<p>Fighter jets from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120922081617mp_/https://www.seattlepi.com/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=news&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22North+American+Aerospace+Defense+Command%22">North American Aerospace Defense Command</a> scrambled to respond to the simulated hijackings and were to run through several hypothetical scenarios, including one that involved shooting down the planes.</p>

			<p>"We're prepared to do it, trained to do it, and ready to do it, but we'd much rather it be the source of last resort," said Marine Maj. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120922081617mp_/https://www.seattlepi.com/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=news&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22Mike+Snyder%22">Mike Snyder</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120922081617mp_/https://www.seattlepi.com/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=news&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22NORAD%22">NORAD</a> spokesman. "But make no mistake, we're ready to do it."</p>

			<p>The exercise, involving more than 1,500 personnel from the United States and Canada, began about 6 a.m. The hijacking scenarios began shortly thereafter.</p>

			<p>One plane, a Delta Air Lines 757, took off from Salt Lake City and was headed to Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage, Alaska.</p>

			<p>The other was a Navy C-9 airlifter, acting as another airliner, which traveled from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120922081617mp_/https://www.seattlepi.com/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=news&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22Whidbey+Island+Naval+Air+Station%22">Whidbey Island Naval Air Station</a> at Oak Harbor to Vancouver, B.C., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120922081617mp_/https://www.seattlepi.com/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=news&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22International+Airport%22">International Airport</a>.</p>

			<p>Both were packed with military personnel acting as civilian passengers. NORAD planned to run through a number of scenarios that would end with the planes landing. Once that occurred, law enforcement on the ground were to run through scenarios dealing with the hijackers from there.</p>

			<p>The exercise was the latest training in the annual Amalgam Virgo exercises.</p>

			<p>Last year's exercise involved testing defenses against a cruise missile attack on the Florida panhandle.</p>

			<p>The 2002 scenario was planned before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but Snyder said the events of that day helped officials fine-tune plans for the exercise. There were no plans for live firing.</p>

			<p>Snyder said the exercise's chief use would be helping other agencies coordinate their response because NORAD has had so much practice since Sept. 11.</p>

			<p>The defense command has flown 22,000 sorties under Operation Noble Eagle and conducted more than 300 so-called aviation events, where fighter jets responded to worries over small or commercial aircraft to determine their intent.</p>

			<p>"NORAD is very well trained and exercised regarding this particular scenario," Snyder said.</p>
