	<h4>It Is Conclusive - 9/11 Aircraft Airborne Well After Crash&ensp;-&ensp;United 93 in the vicinity of Fort Wayne, IN and Champaign, IL at time of Shanksville alleged crash</h4><i>Tuesday, December 6, 2011</i><p></p>


	<p>More information has surfaced which conclusively demonstrates the aircraft reportedly used on 9/11, were airborne well after their alleged crashes. This article supplements our last, "<a href="ACARS-CONFIRMED-911-AIRCRAFT-AIRBORNE-LONG-AFTER-CRASH.html"><em>ACARS CONFIRMED - 9/11 AIRCRAFT AIRBORNE LONG AFTER CRASH</em></a>" in which the ACARS system is explained as well as how to determine if a message were received by the aircraft, along with how ground stations are selected through Flight Tracking Protocol based on messages routed to United 175, N612UA. We now have further evidence which places United 93, N591UA, in the vicinity of Champaign, IL, 500+ miles away from the alleged crash site in Shanksville, PA. This information is further corroborated by a (now former) United Airlines Manager of Flight Dispatch Michael J. Winter.</p>
	<p>On January 28, 2002, Mr. Winter gave an interview to the FBI at United Headquarters near Chicago, IL(1). During this interview, Mr. Winter reviewed a list of ACARS messages explaining the contents and which messages were received or rejected. The messages provided below are the most significant and fatal to what we have been told by the 9/11 Commission. Two messages were routed through the Fort Wayne, Indiana remote ground stations (FWA), followed by two more messages which were routed through Champaign, IL (CMI).</p>
	<ul>
	  <p>The remote ground station used to route the   message to the aircraft (FWA or CMI), the time and date in which the message is sent   (eg. 111351, meaning the 11th of Sept, at 1351Z or 0951am Eastern), the flight   number (UA93), and the tail number of the airplane in which the   message is intended (N591UA), are all highlighted in red. The underlined   date and time is when the message was received by the airplane. Although the first two appear to be identical, the message number denotes that they are in fact two separate messages, which is highlighted in blue. The messages are as follows - </p>

	<p>As described in our <a href="ACARS-CONFIRMED-911-AIRCRAFT-AIRBORNE-LONG-AFTER-CRASH.html">first article</a> on this topic based on Category A and B flight tracking(3), this aircraft would not have had messages routed through the above  remote ground stations if it were enroute to crash in Shanksville, PA. Many other stations are much closer if in fact United 93 crashed in Shanksville. In order to follow the messages based on remote ground stations, we have included the Google Earth File used to construct the various stations and associated messages, with an overlay of the United 93 Flight path according to the National Transportation Safety Board(2).</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>There are 10 remote ground stations closer to the flight path than FWA, even more if including CMI ground station in Champaign, IL which is nearly 500 miles from the Shanksville crater. However, according to Mr. Winter, United 93 received messages from CMI remote ground station in Champaign, IL more than 7 minutes after the alleged crash(1). Mr. Winter explains - </p>

	<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="left">"Printer" and "Screen" indicate the printer on the flight deck and the flight management computer screen, respectively, as is described in the sourced documentation(1). Based on Category A and B flight tracking(3), it can be determined that TOL and FWA are not the best stations for routing messages, however routing through CMI is completely absurd if the aircraft in fact crashed in Shanksville. Furthermore, according to the NTSB animation reconstruction, the aircraft allegedly crashed in Shanksville at 10:03am(4). How can the aircraft possibly receive a message activating an audible signal in the airplane at 1410 (10:10am Eastern)? It can't if it crashed in Shanksville, it can if were in the vicinity of CMI. Finally, there is no possible way that an aircraft can receive a message from a remote ground station which is 500+ miles away. The range for remote ground stations is 200 miles, and that is only guaranteed above 29,000 feet(5). </p>
	<p align="left">We now have several levels of corroboration demonstrating the aircraft were still airborne after their alleged crashes - </p>
	
	<ul>
		<li style="margin-top: 30px; padding-left:10px; list-style: none;"><p>-&ensp;From our first article, the logs themselves showing time sent and received based on statements made by Ed Ballinger,</p></li>
		<li style="margin-top: 30px; padding-left:10px; list-style: none;"><p>-&ensp;Ground station routing based on flight tracking protocols,</p></li>
		<li style="margin-top: 30px; padding-left:10px; list-style: none;"><p>-&ensp;Expert statements,</p></li>
		<li style="margin-top: 30px; padding-left:10px; list-style: none;"><p>-&ensp;And now, messages that were received well out of range from Shanksville, PA after the time of the alleged crash.</p></li>
	</ul>


	<p align="left" style="margin-top: 30px;"><strong> It is conclusive, the 9/11 Aircraft were airborne long after their alleged crashes.</strong></p>
	
	<br><p>Send this evidence to your Congress Representative, your Senators,   Judges, Lawyers, print it out and hand it to your pilots when boarding a   flight (Pilots love reading material while in cruise). Call into talk   shows, tell them about this evidence. Grab our DVD's and make copies,   hand them to friends, family, co-workers, etc. Demand a new   investigation into the events of 9/11. The 9/11 Families, The 9/11   Victims, The American People, The World, deserves  to know Truth about   what happened on September, 11, 2001. </p>
	<p>Founded in August 2006, Pilots For 9/11 Truth is a growing   organization of   aviation professionals from around the globe. The   organization has  analyzed Data provided by the National Transportation   Safety Board (NTSB) for the   Pentagon Attack, the events in   Shanksville, PA and the World Trade Center Attack along with other   information provided by several government agencies through the Freedom   Of Information Act. <strong>The data does not support what we have been told</strong>. Government Agencies refuse to comment. <strong>Pilots For 9/11 Truth   do not offer theory or point blame at this point in time.</strong> However,   there is a growing mountain of conflicting information and   data in which   government agencies and officials refuse to acknowledge.   Pilots For 9/11 Truth    continues to grow and exist only through your   continued support. We thank you! </p>
