			</p>
			<p>TH: I’m very skeptical of 
				anybody who says I know exactly what went on, or I know exactly what 
				didn’t go on. So my position is very agnostic on this. I think it's 
				going to take – I mean, here we are, with the JFK assassination, 40 
				years later, 44 years later – I think it's gonna take a long time 
				to figure out. That said, a good healthy discussion, a good healthy 
				debate and raising the questions and for that matter raising the <i>
				answers</i> to the questions, is a reasonable and healthy thing.
				
			</p>
			<p>Michael Shermer is with us. 
				He’s the founding publisher of <i>Skeptic Magazine</i>, the executive 
				director of the Skeptics Society – their website, 
				
				<a href="http://www.skeptic.com/" target="_blank">
				
				<u>http://www.Skeptic.com</u>
				</a>
				 – Michael, welcome to the program.
				
			</p>
			<p> MS: Welcome, thanks for having 
				me.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: You're welcome, you're 
				welcome. And Kevin Ryan is with us. He's the co-editor of the
				<a href="http://www.JournalOf911Studies.com/" target="_blank">
				Journal of 9/11 Studies</a>,
				the former site manager for Underwriters Laboratories 
				in South Bend, and the website – 
				
				. Kevin Ryan, welcome to the program.
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Hello, thanks for having me. 
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Great to have you both 
				with us. Michael is taking the position – well, I'm not even going 
				to try to characterize you guys’ position [<i>sic</i>]. My goal here, 
				my job here, is to moderate. One thing I’m going to ask is that each 
				of you keep your questions or answers relatively short, and that nobody 
				try to filibuster the other one, and if it happens I'll just jump in. 
				So let's start first of all with you, Kevin, your opening statement.
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Okay, well, really what 
				it looks like we have here, we have a couple of hypotheses, and it's 
				different than JFK because it's not really a question of a conspiracy 
				theory or not. That term actually is wrong for several reasons here 
				because, unless you believe that the crimes of 9/11 were committed by 
				one person acting alone, you believe in a conspiracy theory. Actually, 
				you don't believe in it. All you believe is some sort of hypothesis, 
				because the two major hypotheses are both not well accepted. The official 
				hypothesis is that al Qaeda, with no help from any government agency, 
				committed these irrational acts of violence, and we're not really sure 
				why. It requires extreme negligence on the part of numerous government 
				agencies. Multiple false stories have been told. And in the end it just 
				gives us a reason to invade the strategically important lands.
				
			</p>
			<p>And on the other hand, we've 
				got this alternative hypothesis, that suggests that government agencies 
				were involved, and either let it happen or made it happen. In other 
				words, the crimes of 9/11 were committed by those with the means to 
				accomplish them and those who benefit from the War on Terror. 
				
			</p>
			<p>So, along with that is, if 
				you believe in – if you lean toward the alternative hypothesis, you 
				also believe there has very likely been an intentional cover-up, which 
				can be seen as a greater crime.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Okay, so Michael Shermer 
				– Kevin suggests – and both of you, if I reparaphrase [<i>sic</i>] 
				something incorrectly, feel free to correct me and jump in, but just 
				for the sake of brevity, I'll restate something shortly. My sense of 
				what Kevin just said is that there definitely was a conspiracy – the 
				question is was it a conspiracy by Al Qaeda, you know a small band of 
				Muslim extremists, or was it a conspiracy by the federal government, 
				or people within the government, or people within the United States, 
				or was it a conspiracy by both? Your response?
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: Well, al Qaeda, of course, 
				is a conspiracy. You know, they say they did it, they say they were 
				proud they did it, they would do it again if they could, and they have 
				a long history of doing those sorts of things. Don't forget that the 
				World Trade Center was already attacked in 1993. Over a thousand people 
				were injured in that truck bomb attack. There were all these countless 
				bombings of US embassies throughout the 90s, that Clinton had to deal 
				with. [There were] thwarted attempts, as at LAX, by al Qaeda, and so 
				it's obviously, you know, when you have that kind of evidence, and … 
				And then we have to think about the economy of explanation, that is, 
				is it possible for 19 people to do that, versus to say thousands of 
				Bush operatives secretly running around planting demolition bombs in 
				the World Trade Center buildings for months or years at a time without 
				getting caught? 
				
			</p>
			<p>The reason we tend to favor 
				conspiracy theories is that I think we have a cognitive dissonance between 
				the size of the event and the size of the cause. We tend to think huge, 
				massive events like 9/11 should have an equally massive, complex cause. 
				But, in fact, it's just the opposite. It would be much easier for 19 
				people to hide in nooks and crannies of a free democratic society 
				like the one in which we live and get away with these sorts of things, 
				versus thousands of operatives that would have to be involved if the 
				US government orchestrated [it] – not to mention the issue of <i>Could 
				the US government, which can hardly do anything with competence, manage 
				to pull this off with great confidence, and nobody ever spilled the 
				beans?</i> I mean, look what happens to our US spies or former government 
				agents, Bush operatives, Bush administration members – what happens 
				when they leave office? They <i>write books</i>, they go on Larry King 
				live, they have their – they spill the beans, they tell all kinds 
				of national secrets and stories in order to sell their books and whatnot. 
				Not one person has done that in relation to 9/11, if it was a government 
				conspiracy, which is exactly what we would expect.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Okay, so Kevin Ryan, it 
				sounds like what Michael is saying is Occam's Razor – the simplest 
				explanation is probably the right one.
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Yeah, you know, I personally 
				believe also it's very likely that the truth is simple, but it's not 
				obvious. I've heard Michael use the complexity argument on both sides 
				of this issue, but again we have two hypotheses, what we've got. Really, 
				what separates them is the question of, <i>Were government agencies 
				involved?</i> So, if we can agree that there is such a thing as al Qaeda, 
				the one important question is, <i>What historical facts about al Qaeda 
				and these alleged hijackers should make people skeptical of the official 
				hypothesis? </i>I think it's clear that, if you look through the history, 
				al Qaeda is a product of the CIA's Afghanistan program of the 1980s, 
				when the mujahedin was fighting the Soviets. Al Qaeda has deep connections 
				to the Saudis, and to [the] ISI in Pakistan, and a lot of the hijackers 
				have connections to the ISI as well. You know Khalid Sheikh Muhammed, 
				the “mastermind,” is known to have worked for the ISI. Saeed Sheikh, 
				the 9/11 paymaster, was an ISI agent, and the President Musharraf has 
				a book that says Saeed Sheikh was also an MI6 agent, according to the 
				president. I don't know [about that]. But in any case, Saeed Sheikh 
				reportedly wired $100,000 to Mohammed Atta just before the 9/11 attacks 
				and at the direction of the ISI Chief General Ahmed. So it looks very 
				much like Pakistan's ISI was involved—
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: But that doesn't mean that 
				the US government was.
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Not necessarily, no.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: OK, so Michael Shermer, 
				your response. 
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: Yeah, this is interesting, 
				this is not quite the direction I thought we were going to go, but that's 
				okay. I mean, let's be realistic here, American foreign policy since 
				Kissinger has always been this <i>realpolitik</i>, where we get into 
				bed with dictators all the time. It's a question of, as Lyndon Johnson 
				said, he's a son of a bitch, but he's <i>our</i> son of a bitch. You know, 
				we [<i>sic</i>] do these things, and it's one of the reasons that presidents 
				that want to hold by strict moral principles are criticized. You know, 
				you have to live in the real world, and we have to fund this dictator, 
				because he's better than that communist guy, or whatever it is. So, 
				yeah, no doubt, there's been a lot of government underhanding [<i>sic</i>] 
				things in the Middle East, because it's such a complex mess. But that's 
				still different than saying that they intended to bring down the World 
				Trade Center.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: So, let's get into why 
				people should be skeptical of the 9/11 Commission Report – or not 
				– alternatively, why people should think that this is the last word 
				on it. And what really happened, what really happened on that day? In 
				the second half hour of our report, we'll drop in a few calls from our 
				listeners.
				
			</p>
			<p>[1:17:35 - BREAK]
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: What happened on 9/11? 
				Kevin Ryan is with us from the
				Journal of 9/11 Studies (
				
				<a href="http://www.journalof911studies.com/" target="_blank">
				
				<u>www.JournalOf911Studies.com</u>
				</a>
				)
				co-editor of that journal, and Michael 
				Shermer, editor of <i>Skeptic Magazine</i>, publisher of <i>Skeptic 
				Magazine</i>, executive director of the Skeptics Society (
				
				<a href="http://www.skeptic.com/" target="_blank">
				
				<u>www.Skeptic.com</u>
				</a>
				). I want to get into the real, the 
				inflammatory, “meat-and-potatoes” stuff here: 
				
			</p>
			<ul>
				<p><i>“The 9/11 Commission 
					got it all wrong.”</i>
					
				</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<p><i>“Building 7 was controlled 
					demolition.”</i>
					
				</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<p><i>“What about these 
					things that hit the Pentagon, what happened to all the videotapes, why 
					did they smuggle away all the evidence?”</i>
					
				</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<p><i>“Why did Rudy Giuliani 
					suspend the rescue operations as soon as he had the gold out of the 
					bottom of the World Trade Center?”</i>
					
				</p>
			</ul>
			<p>Probably that's more, you know, 
				self-evident – anyhow, let's start with you, Kevin. Why should we 
				be skeptical of the 9/11 Commission Report?
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Well, for a couple of very 
				important reasons. They left so many of the important facts out of their 
				report, and they had a lot of conflicts of interest, and also they just 
				uncritically accepted accounts from government officials. So they left 
				out, just a gigantic number of facts, all the conflicts of interest 
				– Philip Zelikow, the executive director, for example, was a Bush 
				insider, and really controlled the investigation. Any mention of World 
				Trade Center Seven, the third skyscraper that supposedly collapsed, despite 
				not being hit by a plane [was also omitted]. The fact that President 
				Bush's relatives were in charge of the security company for the World 
				Trade Center, United Airlines, and Dulles Airport –
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Now, that was, that was, 
				that was in the <i>past</i>, though, wasn't it? 
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: No, actually it was in 
				1999 through 2000 for Marvin Bush, but Wirt Walker, his cousin, was 
				CEO at the time that the attacks occurred. So, yeah, and there are a 
				lot of FBI agents who reportedly claim to have known the dates and targets 
				of the attacks well in advance, and their testimony was not included. 
				There were news stories suggesting, after 9/11, that the US military 
				allowed Osama bin Laden to escape. Just the fact that the Bush and bin 
				Laden families are old business partners might have been something you 
				could put in that report –
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: George [Bush] Sr. was having 
				breakfast with Osama bin Laden's brother on the morning of 9/11, I believe 
				that was in the <i>New York Times</i> –
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Yeah.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: So a lot of questions here, 
				Kevin. You're asserting that all of these questions
				point to conspiracy?
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Well, no, I'm saying we 
				have a conspiracy, no matter what, but of the two hypotheses, the one 
				that the evidence supports the most strongly is that there were government 
				agencies involved in the attacks. We can't prove either one, one way 
				or the other –
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: What about <i>rogue agents</i>, 
				rogues within the government – 
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Absolutely.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Like with the Kennedy assassination. 
				I mean, you know, E. Howard Hunt was part of the CIA, but that doesn't 
				mean the CIA had anything to do with it. 
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Sure, and maybe just ask 
				a simple question, like <i>Who was responsible for, and in charge of, 
				defending the country when it was under attack? What did those people 
				do on 9/11?</i> We find out that everybody in the chain of command was 
				either mysteriously absent or completely incompetent during just that 
				period of the attacks. I mean, Bush was reading <i>My Pet Goat</i>, 
				right? The next person was Donald Rumsfeld, and the Commission says 
				he did not enter the chain of command until the morning's events were 
				over. And then the Joint Chiefs of Staff Henry Shelton was flying to 
				London, and his replacement was in a meeting, and General Montague Winfield 
				of the NMCC, believe it or not, asked his deputy to take over for just 
				the two hours of the day – of the attack. This poor Captain Leidig, 
				who replaced him for just those two hours, turned out to be incompetent. 
				And then NORAD's General Eberhart was indisposed because he was driving 
				around on Cheyenne Mountain. 
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Now, is all of this or 
				is none of this in the 9/11 report, Kevin?
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Really, none of this is 
				clarified – obviously, the President was indisposed, he was in this 
				elementary school, and why—
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: But most of this stuff 
				that you're raising, that really raises eyebrows, you're suggesting 
				is not in the 9/11 report. I’ve skimmed the thing, but I haven’t 
				read every word. Michael Shermer, your response, Michael Shermer of 
				<a href="http://skeptic.com/" target="_blank">Skeptic.com</a>?
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: Yeah. Well, just for fun 
				here while we were talking, I typed in to Google Video "building demolition",
				and there are no less than 2200 videos of buildings that collapsed due 
				to intentional demolition. And every one of them – I haven't found 
				one exception, yet – collapses from the bottom up. And yet the World 
				Trade Center buildings collapsed from the top down – not quite the 
				top, but right where the airplanes impacted. So are we to believe that 
				the Bush administration orchestrated the attacks, the intentional demolition 
				of the World Trade Center buildings, planted all those bombs without 
				anybody – demolition devices without anybody catching them, and then 
				managed to place the bombs in just such a way that they would start 
				exploding right where the plane happened to hit (so they’d have to 
				know where the planes are going to hit) – and timed all that –
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: (Laughs)
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: – Are we really supposed 
				to believe all that?
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Kevin, is that possible?
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Well, there’s [<i>sic</i>] 
				a great deal of assumptions here. Michael's already worked out how many 
				people, he said thousands of operatives would be needed – let's not 
				get away from ourselves here, we've got a couple of hypotheses, we've 
				got evidence. We don't need to speculate to the point of distraction. 
				Let's consider where the towers first failed, though. We know the North 
				Tower –
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: We have to take a break 
				in about 10 seconds, 15 seconds – first of all, collapsing from the 
				top down versus the bottom up—
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: No, there are examples 
				of buildings being demolished from the top down. I’d go to 911 
				<a href="http://blogger.com/" target="_blank">blogger.com</a>, 
				you can find an example there. 
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: OK. We'll continue this 
				conversation between Michael Shermer of 
				<a href="http://skeptic.com/" target="_blank">Skeptic.com</a>
				and Kevin Ryan, 
				<a href="http://journalof911studies.com/" target="_blank">
				JournalOf9/11Studies.com</a>,
				maybe drop a few calls in here as we go through. 
				
			</p>
			<p>[1:28:19 - BREAK]
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: And here we are on the 
				radio. Who did 9/11, how and why? We’re talking with Kevin Ryan,
				co-editor of the
				<a href="http://journalof911studies.com/" target="_blank">
				Journal of 9/11 Studies</a>,
				and Michael Shermer of the
				<a href="http://skeptic.com/" target="_blank">
				Skeptic Magazine</a>, 
				executive director of 
				the Skeptics Society. Kevin, you just gone through a long list of some 
				very serious questions. Michael, your response. 
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: Well, I guess the other 
				thing I was going to add about, you know, in terms of how the buildings 
				collapsed and all that, and the assumptions we make – there's also 
				a cognitive problem here, it's called the hindsight bias. After a big 
				event like this, people start combing through the details of the event, 
				the records of what happened, in the months leading up to it. Pearl 
				Harbor’s a perfect example. There were, for many years, lots of conspiracy 
				theories about how Roosevelt knew about it, or –
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Still is.
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: – orchestrated it, or 
				Churchill and Roosevelt together –
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: And there’s still people 
				who believe it.
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: – Just like one specific 
				example, where we see like with the memo that Condi Rice got in August 
				about al Qaeda attacking the United States on United States soil. And
				<i>why didn't we heed that warning?</i> Well, there was [<i>sic</i>]
				actually lots of memos about al Qaeda doing all sorts of things all over
				the world, and of course after the event it’s easy to go back in hindsight 
				and figure out the one that mattered. The same thing with the Pearl 
				Harbor attack – there were definitely memos that the US government 
				had about the Japanese possibly attacking Pearl Harbor. It's easy to 
				pick those out and ignore the hundreds of others about the Japanese 
				attacking in other places, because after the event, after the fact,
				you go through and you reconstruct a causal chain that points right to
				that event and then hold those accountable who should've seen that chain 
				coming. When in fact at the time, you don't know what’s going to happen.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Okay, Kevin Ryan from the 
				<a href="http://journalof911studies.com/" target="_blank">
				JournalOf911Studies.com</a>. Talk to us about Building 7.
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: All-right, well, Building 
				Seven was a 47-story building that was not hit by a plane, and yet it 
				collapsed in 6.5 seconds – essentially free-fall speed – and pretty 
				much into its own footprint, and here we are six years later still waiting 
				for an official explanation about it. In 2002 FEMA gave us a really 
				low probability suggestion, <i>they</i> said, and NIST has continued 
				to push their report out. But it's important to know that no building 
				has ever collapsed from fire before or after 9/11. And no building exhibiting 
				all the features of demolition has ever <i>not</i> been a demolition. 
				So speaking of probabilities, the chances of the first three examples 
				of fire-induced collapse of a tall building happening all on the same 
				day is infinitesimal. So I think it's a good point for us to be skeptical 
				about, especially considering the 9/11 Commission didn't mention it 
				in their supposedly comprehensive report.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Here’s the question that 
				I can’t get my head around, Kevin. And let me – and Michael, if 
				I may – I suspect this is something you might say so I'll say it. 
				The flying of the planes into these two buildings was plenty. Why would 
				anybody have to go in and put in explosives on top of that? I mean, 
				you know, that was enough to give George Bush everything he needed to 
				declare – that's his Reichstag fire.
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: You know, I'm not sure 
				Thom, but you have to consider what the alternative hypothesis means. 
				And I think David Ray Griffin put it well when he said, whoever controls 
				the world's oil controls the <i>world</i>.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: He said on this program 
				two years ago.
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: This is not just another 
				government-sponsored false-flag event, like the Gulf of Tonkin or many 
				others. But it's more of a psychological operation aimed at a large 
				audience.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: But again, why bring down 
				the buildings? The planes were enough to horrify us. 
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: They needed people to be 
				in front of the TV, is what it looks like. So, if the buildings are 
				rigged for demolition, it doesn't matter – there’s a demolition 
				team there, it doesn't matter where the buildings are hit – they’re 
				rigged for demolition. And if you wait an hour or so until everybody’s 
				in front of the TV, then the psychological effect is there. And that's 
				what drives the emotionally driven 9/11 wars. You know, if something 
				just happened to a building – something had happened to a building <i>
				before</i>. The embassies in Africa that were blown up, right? 
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: The World Trade Center 
				was blown up, it just didn't –
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: The World Trade Center 
				was blown up. The Oklahoma City building was blown up. Lots of buildings 
				have been blown up, but they didn't result in generating endless wars 
				that are supposed to protect us from terrorism, which is an oxymoron 
				to begin with. You know, it just doesn't make any sense. So, what makes 
				sense is that those people with the power to make this happen, to allow 
				an effective stand down of our air defenses, to allow these hijackers 
				to get lucky at every single turn, to essentially have access to, and 
				the means to, bring those buildings down – those are the people who 
				are much more likely to have effected the crimes.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Michael Shermer. 
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: Well, Thom, I think your 
				point is well taken. It wouldn't have mattered really what happened 
				to the full extent on 9/11, we'd be in a war (laughs). I mean, I think 
				you can legitimately criticize the Bush administration for all of its 
				steps along the way, and even its motives, without any of this 9/11 
				conspiracy stuff going on, because that's just sort of the way politics 
				works. 
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: But what about the security 
				standing down, what about ignoring the warnings?
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: OK, well, let's look at 
				the specific points. If you watch the videos of the World Trade Center 
				buildings collapsing, they both collapse right at the point of the planes 
				hit. 
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: No, actually that's—
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: That's where they begin.
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: No, that’s not—
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: We can all watch it. Let's 
				all go online and watch it right now.
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Sure. Let's do it.
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: That’s the point where 
				they collapse!
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Well, hold on Michael, 
				Kevin wants to contest that.
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: That’s actually not true 
				at all. If we look at the North Tower, the first thing that happens 
				is that the antenna on the top drops first. That means the core of the 
				building failed first. And additionally in the South Tower, the first 
				thing that happened is this large upper section starts to tilt over, 
				and it's got kinks all along the top of it, so it fails in multiple 
				spots, even away from the fire. But again, even if, even if the collapse 
				or the destruction was to start right at the point of impact, if the 
				buildings are rigged for demolition, what does it matter?
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Allright, Michael, I’m 
				sorry I interrupted you in mid-sentence, but I wanted that point to 
				get resolved.
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: When you say “they” 
				did it, who in the world are we <i>talking</i> about here? Where <i>
				are</i> all these people? Why have they not come <i>forward</i>? Are 
				they <i>murdered</i>, are they kept silent? Again, back to my first 
				point, look what happens to all these people. Like, Plame, what's her 
				name –
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Valerie.
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: Yeah, Valerie Plame. Look, 
				you got a book contract out there. This is what people do once they 
				leave government. I mean, there's—
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: But Valerie Plame is not 
				running around bragging that she helped murder 3000 people.
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: Yeah, well, right. 
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: I mean, who’s gonna do 
				that? 
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: Well, no, you wouldn’t 
				be somebody who actually did it, just imagine all the people who would 
				have to be running around – it's now been estimated that it would 
				be 60 tons of explosives to bring down the World Trade Center—
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Oh, not at all, not at 
				all. 
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: Where, where are those 
				– and where are the explosives? How come all the people combing through 
				the wreckage didn't find anything, not one little piece of evidence 
				for that? Where is all that? 
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: You’ve got really a lot 
				of false speculation going on there. The Landmark Hotel was brought 
				down with about 450 pounds of explosives. It was 30 stories tall, and 
				so the World Trade Center. If you extrapolate that would've required 
				about 1300 pounds of explosives. That's about 30 trips, you know, 10 
				people in three trips. It's not that difficult to believe at all, and 
				of course the idea that —
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: But speculating is one 
				thing, but where is the evidence that that's actually what happened?
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Well, see the evidence 
				that demolition happened is about the effects, right – the sudden 
				onset, the symmetrical and vertical fall, the near-free-fall speed – 
				these are things that just can't happen in a fire-induced collapse. 
				And we've really <i>tried</i> to prove – I mean, if the government 
				has done anything, they’ve really tried to prove this fire-induced 
				collapse hypothesis, and they’ve failed. In fact, they've proved wrong 
				through contradiction. They've tried <i>so</i> many things, and we've 
				found that the only thing we have left, which they never looked at, 
				is the demolition hypothesis. And so, really, I think it’s time—
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: I’d say that World Trade 
				Center Building 7 does not collapse in, straight down into its footprint. 
				It collapses where the debris hit on the south side. If you look at 
				the photos of the north side, it looks clean and fairly pristine and 
				you can't believe it would have collapsed from that, but if you look 
				on [<i>sic</i>] the photos on the south side, it burned extensively, 
				for many hours.
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Oh, Michael, if you have 
				photos on [<i>sic</i>] the south side of the World Trade Center Seven, 
				you need to get those to the government. I don't believe they have anything, 
				and so far I don't believe they've been published. So what really happened, 
				if you look at the movie clip, this building collapses more perfectly 
				than even a perfect demolition. It comes down <i>straight</i> down, 
				and uniformly down. It doesn't lean towards any damage – and really 
				the only damage – again that’s speculation on the part of those 
				supporting the official story, is –
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Kevin, let me just 
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Sure.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Kevin, let me just toss, 
				uh – I got it – if you really wanted to create psychological chaos 
				and mass mayhem, why not have the buildings fall over sideways, take 
				out ten other buildings with them and kill 20-30,000 people rather than 
				3000? Then you really have a 9/11, or a Pearl Harbor.
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: I tell you what, let's 
				possible. I don't know why, the reasoning for whoever did it, why they 
				did it in the exact way, but again, the hypotheses don't need to be <i>
				proven</i>. We need to look at the evidence and pick which one of them 
				is best suited to be accepted, or rejected. And so, you know, to speculate 
				on all the different things that would've had to happen, as Michael 
				has done, as though he knows exactly how many people would be needed, 
				he knows exactly how many explosives (and that turns out to be wrong), 
				it's very <i>unskeptical</i>. 
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: Let me give you an analogy. 
				Last April, there was a crash in an underpass under a bridge in Oakland. 
				A tanker truck crashed into a bridge; it caused this <i>huge</i> gasoline 
				fire, and the bridge collapsed. Now, why is nobody getting all excited 
				about somebody intentionally demolishing this bridge? Well, because 
				things collapse if they burn long enough. You don't have to completely 
				melt steel, you only have to weaken it, and that's what happened with 
				the World Trade Center buildings. 
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: OK, I think we've hashed 
				this one out. I'd like to move, as we have very little time here, we’re 
				gonna&nbsp; have to take a break in about a minute and then we’ll 
				only have six or seven minutes when we resolve [<i>sic</i>] this. I 
				apologize to people waiting on hold, but I just want to get as much 
				as I can out of you guys. Let’s talk to how, how it came to be that 
				these planes hit these buildings and the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania 
				[<i>sic</i>]. Kevin, your best thought on how this came about?
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: That is a <i>great</i> 
				question, you know, because the airspace over Washington is restricted 
				and is considered the most heavily defended on the planet. It even has 
				a name, it’s called P-56-B, a three-mile inner restricted zone over 
				the White House, Capitol and the Pentagon. So we’ve got, also, Secretary 
				of Transportation Norman Mineta telling us that the Vice President was 
				warned, every ten or 20 miles, that this plane was coming in, that it 
				was coming in, and he said that the orders should still stand. He had 
				this young man telling him that. So it's interesting that Norman Mineta’s 
				testimony didn't get into the 9/11 Commission Report. But it is clear 
				that we had notice that the Pentagon was going to be struck. 
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: OK, we'll continue with 
				this conversation right after the break. Kevin Ryan,
				<a href="http://journalof911studies.com/" target="_blank">
				JournalOf911Studies.com</a>; 
				Michael Shermer,
				<a href="http://skeptic.com/" target="_blank">Skeptic.com</a>.
				
			</p>
			<p>[1:47:10 - BREAK]
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: 51 minutes past the hour. 
				Our quote from the day from Winston Churchill: “The truth is incontrovertible. 
				Malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it, but in the end, there 
				it is.” So what is the truth regarding 9/11? Michael Shermer, <i>Skeptic</i> 
				magazine, why is it that Osama bin Laden isn't on the FBI's Most Wanted 
				list, has never been charged with 9/11?
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: I have no idea, you'd have 
				to ask the government that. I mean, why are we spending billions of 
				dollars trying to find him if we don't want him? What difference does 
				it make whether he is on the list or not? Don't think the FBI's going 
				to find him, because they're not in Afghanistan, they're here.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Yeah. 
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: That would be my guess. 
				I mean, otherwise, I mean, you can argue we're in Iraq for oil, but 
				why would we be in Afghanistan other than just trying to dismantle al 
				Qaeda? 
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Well, you could argue that 
				Hamid Karzai used to be a consultant for Unocal, and Unocal wanted to 
				build a gas pipeline across Afghanistan, etc. but that's getting a little 
				away – well, maybe it's not, I don’t know.
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: Well, I wouldn't try to 
				connect too many dots there. Again, back to the economy of causality, 
				I think, Occam's Razor, you know, the simpler explanation. Nineteen 
				guys <i>can</i> get away with it. Hundreds would most likely be caught, 
				or <i>eventually</i>, something would come out. We really have nothing. 
				All of these arguments are, like in creationist circles, we call these 
				the dot of the gaps: Wherever you guys can't explain X, that must be 
				where the supernatural entity came in to do something.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: So here, Kevin –
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: here, wherever the government 
				can't explain something, that must mean there is a conspiracy. Well, 
				it's possible that maybe we just can't explain it yet. 
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Right, and sometimes there 
				actually <i>is</i> a conspiracy. So, Kevin Ryan, here again, I'm trying 
				to play independent broker. Kevin, how small a conspiracy, at the very 
				least, to allow this to happen, could there be, and you know, ‘cause 
				I hear conspiracy theories that, you know, Bush didn't really know when 
				they were going to hit, he knew it was going to happen probably in August 
				or September, and he knew it was going to happen in New York or Washington, 
				DC, and he wanted it to happen, so they stood down – all the way up 
				to, you know, right down to, they had control systems in Building 7 
				that flew the planes into the towers, but why they had to – you know, 
				there's this whole spectrum of – but how small a group could it have 
				been?
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Well, I think it could've 
				been a relatively small group, based on a military sort of operation, 
				a compartmentalized operation. I'm not an expert on those sorts of things. 
				But as far as whistleblowers go,
				we do know there's been a lot of whistleblowers related to 9/11.
				I mean, there were FBI agents trying to contact John Ashcroft
				for six weeks before 9/11 to give him exact details, and he 
				wouldn't return their <i>calls</i>. We got Sibel Edmonds, the FBI whistleblower 
				who told us, they haven't even mentioned anybody who's actually connected 
				to al Qaeda at a mid- or higher level. So the 9/11 Commission isn't 
				even addressing the issue of Al Qaeda. We got Jersey Girl Patty Casazza, 
				who recently said that whistleblowers told her [that] before 9/11, the 
				government knew the <i>day</i>, the <i>type of attack</i>, and the <i>
				targets.</i> So there's a lot of whistleblowers out there. That's not 
				the question. The question is, <i>why aren't people finding out about 
				this?</i> For example, World Trade Center 7 is a great example. A lot 
				of people still don't know about that, it's no secret, you know, it's 
				no secret that that building collapsed. So, I think that there are plenty 
				of whistleblowers. There's plenty of – a chance for the truth to yet 
				come out one way or another. 
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: So, Michael Shermer, 
				<a href="http://skeptic.com/" target="_blank">Skeptic.com</a>, 
				why – what about the stock options, these puts that were made before 
				9/11, you know, betting on the collapse of United and American Airlines? 
				You’ve got that, you've got all these whistleblowers, you got over 
				50 specific warnings to the Bush administration –
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: Well again, with the 
				hindsight bias we pick out anomalies, we connect the dots in some particular 
				way – 
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: But that's what you do 
				in criminal investigations.
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: But if there was so much 
				activity ahead of time, why didn't we know about it, why didn't somebody 
				do something about this? Because, surely, not everybody would be in 
				on the conspiracy.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Well, it certainly seems 
				to have worked out pretty well for the Bush administration.
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: Well, Has it? I mean, they’re 
				at their all-time—
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Yeah, I mean, Cheney’s—
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: — lowest rating as a 
				president—
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: I don't think he expected 
				the war in Iraq to go south like that. But you know, Halliburton's stock 
				is four times what it was, Dick Cheney has made millions and millions 
				of dollars off this, the Bush family and Bechtel have made billions 
				of dollars off this thing, and continue to [do so]. 
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: Yes, well, [but] you don’t 
				need a conspiracy for that, that, that's just good old American politics 
				and business, right?
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: You think that's opportunism.
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: That happens, that happened 
				in the Vietnam War.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Yes, Lady Bird Johnson 
				made out well—
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: That doesn't mean there 
				was a huge conspiracy, to—
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Well, again, we’ve <i>
				got</i> a conspiracy no matter how you look at it. So the “conspiracy 
				theory” term is just a derogatory term to try and turn people's minds 
				away from looking at the evidence. But I think that there's plenty of 
				opportunity for the government, certain elements within the government, 
				to have not only accomplished the attacks of 9/11 <i>much</i> more easily 
				than 19 fellas, from –
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: How about the suicide boat 
				bombing against the <i>USS Cole</i> in 2000? 
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: How about it?
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: Yeah, I mean, do you think 
				the US government did that to its own ship?
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Well, we have—
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Let me just pause this, 
				we have 30 seconds to wrap it up. So, Kevin Ryan, 15 seconds.
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Well, I think the evidence 
				that we have on hand points to the need to accept the alternative hypothesis. 
				You know, skeptics, <i>natural</i> skeptics, would be looking at that 
				official hypothesis very closely and also at the evidence for the alternative.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: And Michael Shermer? 
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: Well, because I think it's 
				legitimate to criticize the Bush administration for this whole business, 
				this [alternative conspiracy theory] is only a distraction away from 
				that because it’s so far out there. Al Qaeda said they did it, they’d 
				do it again, they were proud that they did it, and I think we should 
				take them at their word for it [<i>sic</i>]. 
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: OK, Michael Shermer, 
				<a href="http://skeptic.com/" target="_blank">Skeptic.com</a>, 
				Kevin Ryan, 
				<a href="http://journalof911studies.com/" target="_blank">
				JournalOf911Studies.com</a>. Gentlemen, both of you, thank you 
				so much for coming on the program and talking with each other and with 
				me. 
				
			</p>
			<p>MS: Oh, you’re welcome.
				
			</p>
			<p>KR: Thank you, thank you. 
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Much appreciated. 
				
			</p>
			<p>[1:58:06 - end of guest portion]
				
			</p>
			<p>[2:07:57 – start of listener 
				calls]
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: …Please be very brief. 
				Robert, Daly City, CA.
				
			</p>
			<p>Robert: Thom , thanks so much 
				for having Kevin Ryan on. He's very intelligent, moral, and even-minded.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: I agree with you, they're 
				both great people, Rob. Make your point, please, as I need to move on 
				to other people as quickly as possible.
				
			</p>
			<p>Robert: Yeah – well, Richard 
				B. Cheney was running a US Air Force training exercise on 9/11, and 
				he's the guy that hijacked the U.S. Air Force training exercises and 
				an investigation will prove that.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Yeah, okay, great – I've 
				heard that before, and I would love to see an investigation. Thank you. 
				Mike in Eugene, Oregon – hey, Mike. 
				
			</p>
			<p>Mike: Hi, how are you doing, 
				Thom? Thanks for having me. 
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Hmm, good point. [sic]
				
			</p>
			<p>Mike: People who put down “Truthers” 
				– I think, specifically, if you focus on the missing Pentagon videos, 
				we're very video-oriented society. If a car ran into a mini mart, their 
				surveillance footage would be across the nation that night.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Where are the Pentagon 
				surveillance videos? Good point, Mike, thank you very much. Josh in 
				Charlottesville Virginia? Hey Josh.
				
			</p>
			<p>Josh: Hey Thom. Thanks for 
				having me. I’m sorry, I just don’t buy into this grand conspiracy 
				theory that Bush was behind 9/11.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Now, see, that’s – 
				there's dozens of different possibilities, and one of them is that he 
				had nothing to do with it, and it's still there was a conspiracy here 
				in United States. Or, it could be that the level of his conspiracy was 
				simply “OK, I've been warned that these guys are going to hit, and 
				I can make political hay out of this, so I'm going to go to sleep for 
				six months.” I mean, he took the longest vacation in the history of 
				the United States presidency. And even at the end of that – of his 
				vacation, he was afraid to go back to DC, he went to Florida instead, 
				where his brother put the whole state on a state of emergency. 
				
			</p>
			<p>Josh: I agree with you, it 
				does seem like that. But if there was a conspiracy by the Bush administration, 
				it was that they took advantage of 9/11. I don't think that they—
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: You don't think that they 
				caused it. Josh, good – thank you very much, and excellent point. 
				As I said, my mind is not made up, but I – I'm trying to keep an open 
				mind here. We need a real investigation. Josephine in Brooklyn New York. 
				Hey Josephine. 
				
			</p>
			<p>Josephine: Hey, thank you, 
				Thom, it's so good to be on your show. Listen, we just had something 
				recently that happened, we had, on August 29 we had six nuclear bombs 
				fly across this—
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Right, down to Barksdale 
				Air Force Base.
				
			</p>
			<p>Josephine: That’s right, 
				and nobody knows what happened, nobody taking any responsibility—
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Well, actually, I think 
				about 60 people lost their jobs over that, and people got busted down 
				in rank. There was a news story about that. Assuming that that's, you 
				know, that that's true – I mean, one never knows with the Pentagon, 
				you know, whether there's a CYA going on inside, or whether it's public 
				publicity. Yeah, good point, Josephine, and frankly, I can give you 
				a long list of historical conspiracies, going all the way back to the 
				Civil War that were kept secret for more than 40 years. Lisa in South 
				Carolina.
				
			</p>
			<p>Lisa: Hello, I would like to 
				know why they all limit it to two hypotheses. And, why not look at the 
				physical evidence?
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Well, I think that's what 
				we were trying to do, what to say that there is more than just
				two possibilities, two hypotheses here.
				
			</p>
			<p>Lisa: And, where did the material 
				go? There's no material there. The guys they rescued down in Stairwell 
				B, when they came out they said it was like walking onto an empty football 
				field. That's not like any controlled demolition I've ever seen.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: That's interesting one. 
				Thank you, Lisa. Yeah, and all the steel got shipped off, as I recall, 
				to Korea to be melted down, strangely enough. Abby in San Diego, California, 
				Abby.
				
			</p>
			<p>Abby: Hi, thank you. Well, 
				one thing Kevin didn't mention was the plethora of evidence for controlled 
				demolition, including the molten metal. We see thermate dripping out 
				of the tower before it collapses. Thermate, Steven Jones, he’s a physics 
				professor from BYU, he did forensics testing on the steel, found thermate, 
				which is an explosive incendiary in the military. Hundreds of eyewitness 
				accounts of explosives [by] firefighters, emergency responders, William 
				Rodriguez, a janitor in the World Trade Center for 20 years. Now he 
				spends his life dedicated to spreading the truth, spreading information 
				that there were explosives, he heard explosions in the subbasement before 
				the towers were even hit. The freefall speed of both towers. The pulverization 
				of concrete. Wake up, guys. Visit AE911Truth.org – hundreds of architects 
				and engineers who are signing on for a new investigation because they've 
				looked at this evidence.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Yeah, I've seen their video. 
				Thank you, Abby, and it's a fascinating site. Bernard in Los Angeles. 
				A Bernard.
				
			</p>
			<p>Bruno: Hi, this is Bruno. Yeah, 
				I agree with Abby, I mean, just the videos of the buildings themselves 
				coming down is the evidence, and both towers came down the exact same 
				way –
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Couldn't that just have 
				been incompetent design, or intentional design so that it would –
				
			</p>
			<p>Bruno: Oh, yeah, right –
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: – if the buildings were 
				ever compromised, they would hurt as few people as possible? 
				
			</p>
			<p>Bruno: No. All that steel? 
				There’s a massive steel grid wrapped around each tower, and there's 
				47 massive steel columns in the core of the tower, and you think all 
				that steel snapped simultaneously, floor by floor,
				110 floors in 10 seconds. That's preposterous.
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: OK. 
				
			</p>
			<p>Bruno: And Michael from <i>
				Skeptic</i> magazine offered no evidence to support anything about the 
				official story. I mean –
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: I got it, I got it, Bernard, 
				thank you very much – and I don't disagree. Katie in Los Angeles, 
				just a very quick one, Katie, and then we’ve got to go to Tony Parsons.
				
			</p>
			<p>Katie: OK, I'm from WeAreChangeLA.org, 
				we did the Bill Maher infiltration. We have a Truth March street action 
				this Sunday, November 11, at 11 a.m. in Santa Monica. Go to WeAreChangeLA.org. 
				It’s at&nbsp; Colorado and Ocean Ave, at the top of the Santa Monica 
				Pier. 
				
			</p>
			<p>TH: Got it, got it, thank you 
				very much, Katie, and thanks for coming on and sharing that. And good 
				luck with your demonstration.
