		<p>Domestic Preparedness Against Weapons of Mass Destruction </p>
		<p>     Protecting America's homeland and citizens from the threat of weapons of mass destruction is one of our Nation's important national security challenges.  Today, more nations possess chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons than ever before.  Still others seek to join them.  Most troubling of all, the list of these countries includes some of the world's least-responsible states -- states for whom terror and blackmail are a way of life.  Some non-state terrorist groups have also demonstrated an interest in acquiring weapons of mass destruction. </p>
		<p>     Against this backdrop, it is clear that the threat of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons being used against the United States -- while not immediate -- is very real.  That is why our Nation actively seeks to deny chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons to those seeking to acquire them.  That is why, together with our allies, we seek to deter anyone who would contemplate their use.  And that is also why we must ensure that our Nation is prepared to defend against the harm they can inflict. </p>
		<p>     Should our efforts to reduce the threat to our country from weapons of mass destruction be less than fully successful, prudence dictates that the United States be fully prepared to deal effectively with the consequences of such a weapon being used here on our soil. </p>
		<p>     Today, numerous Federal departments and agencies have programs to deal with the consequences of a potential use of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapon in the United States.  Many of these Federal programs offer training, planning, and assistance to state and local governments.  But to maximize their effectiveness, these efforts need to be seamlessly integrated, harmonious, and comprehensive. </p>
		<p>     Therefore, I have asked Vice President Cheney to oversee the development of a coordinated national effort so that we may do the very best possible job of protecting our people from catastrophic harm.  I have also asked Joe Allbaugh, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to create an Office of National Preparedness.  This Office will be responsible for implementing the results of those parts of the national effort overseen by Vice President Cheney that deal with consequence management.  Specifically it will coordinate all Federal programs dealing with weapons of mass destruction consequence management within the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Justice, and Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other federal agencies.  The Office of National Preparedness will work closely with state and local governments to ensure their planning, training, and equipment needs are addressed.  FEMA will also work closely with the Department of Justice, in its lead role for crisis management, to ensure that all facets of our response to the threat from weapons of mass destruction are coordinated and cohesive.  I will periodically chair a meeting of the National Security Council to review these efforts. </p>
		<p>     No governmental responsibility is more fundamental than protecting the physical safety of our Nation and its citizens.  In today's world, this obligation includes protection against the use of weapons of mass destruction.  I look forward to working closely with Congress so that together we can meet this challenge. </p>
