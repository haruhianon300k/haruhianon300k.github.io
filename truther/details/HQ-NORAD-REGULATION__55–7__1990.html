	<p>HQ NORTH AMERICAN AEROSPACE DEFENSE COMMAND NORAD REGULATION 55-7<br>
	Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado 80914-5002 6 July 1990</p>

	<p>Operations</p>
	
	<p>AIRBORNE SURVEILLANCE OF HIJACKED AIRCRAFT</p>

	<p>This regulation defines how North American Aerospace Defense (NORAD) forces carry out airborne surveillance of hijacked aircraft and aircraft used without authorization within the NORAD system. It applies to HQ NORAD, regions, sectors and the commanders of all other units under the operational control of the Commander in Chief NORAD (CINCNORAD). Other commands and agencies having air defense responsibilities to CINCNORAD use this regulation for guidance.</p>

	<p>NORAD region commanders are authorized to supplement this regulation to establish specific responsibilities and operating procedures for their area of responsibility. Submit supplements in draft to HQ NORAD, Deputy Director for Air Defense Operations, Ground Environment Division (J30G), for review and approval prior to publication.</p><blockquote>

		<p>1. General:</p><blockquote>
	
			<p>a. For the purpose of clarity and conciseness in this regulation, the term "hijack" will cover situations in which aircraft control is seized in order to go somewhere other than the scheduled destination and when an aircraft is stolen or used without permission of the owner and or Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or Transport Canada (TC) authorities. The term "escort aircraft" applies to any military aircraft assigned to the escort mission.</p>
	
			<p>b. Escort missions are requested by the FAA or TC. The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) or Canadian Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) may task NORAD to escort aircraft in the event of a hijacking. Escort missions are coordinated between NORAD units and other military and civilian agencies to prevent interference with military operations, avoid possible international incident and provide safety of flight.</p>
		</blockquote>
	
		<p>2. Responsibilities:</p><blockquote>
	
			<p>a. HQ NORAD, Air Defense Operations Division (J30):</p><blockquote>
	
				<p>(1) Develops requirements and standards for jointly agreed upon control procedures for escort missions with the FAA.</p>
	
				<p>(2) Develops requirements and standards for jointly agreed upon control procedures for escort missions with IC.<br>
				<blockquote>

				<p>(4) Ensures hijacked aircraft track is Forward Told to the NDOC when in or approaching Canadian airspace.</p>
	
				<p>(5) Notifies designated NORAD staff personnel of hijack activity.</p>
			</blockquote>
	
			<p>c. Canadian, Continental United States (CONUS), and Alaskan NORAD Region Commanders. Are authorized to coordinate with unit commanders in their areas of responsibility to establish procedures for assigned units which might be directed by the NMCC or NDOC to perform an escort mission.</p>
	
			<p>d. Canadian NORAD Region (CANR). The commander is assigned as executive agent for Commander in Chief, NORAD (CINCNORAD), for the development of jointly coordinated procedures with TC.</p>
	
			<p>e. Commander, CONUS NORAD Region (CONR):</p><blockquote>
	
				<p>(1) Is assigned as executive agent for CINCNORAD for the development of jointly coordinated procedures with the FAA.</p>
	
				<p>(2) Is assigned as executive agent for CINCNORAD for the development of jointly agreed upon procedures for escort missions with the Caribbean Regional Operations Center (CARIBROC) (in his or her capacity as agent for US Commander in Chief, Atlantic Command (USCINCLANT)).</p>
	
				<p>(3) Determines the termination point for escort missions en route to Cuba by coordination with CARIBROC according to procedures established by CINCNORAD and USCINCLANT.</p>
	
				<p>(4) Is assigned as executive agent for CINCNORAD for development of jointly agreed procedures with USCINCPAC for escort missions.</p>
	
				<p>(5) Is assigned as executive agent for CINCNORAD for development of jointly agreed upon procedures with HQ Strategic Air Command (SAC) for the use of tanker aircraft in the event the escort mission profile requires air-to-air refueling of escort aircraft.</p>
			</blockquote>
	
			<p>f. Commander, Alaskan NORAD Region (ANR):</p><blockquote>
	
				<p>(1) Is assigned as executive agent for CINCNORAD for development of jointly coordinated procedures with appropriate FAA agencies in Alaska.</p>
	
				<p>(2) Is assigned as executive agent for CINCNORAD for development of jointly agreed procedures with the Pacific Command (PACOM) and Alaskan Command (ALCOM) for escort missions.</p>
			</blockquote>
		</blockquote>
	
		<p>3. Procedures:</p><blockquote>
	
			<p>a. Notification:</p><blockquote>
	
				<p>(1) The NMCC or the NDOC requests escort missions through the NORAD Command Center (NCC).</p>
	
				<p>(2) The NCC tasks the proper NORAD region(s) to conduct the escort mission(s). Escort missions are not conducted or continued if:</p><blockquote>
	
					<p>(a) They interfere with the conduct of an active air defense mission(s); or</p>
	
					<p>(b) Flight safety conditions do not allow airborne surveillance.</p>
				</blockquote>
	
				<p>(3) Once the NCC has approved an escort mission request, direct liaison for detailed mission execution between affected ROCCs or SOCCs and Air Traffic Control (ATC) agencies is authorized. All affected agencies will keep their higher headquarters advised of the progress and or significant changes in the mission.</p>
			</blockquote>
	
			<p>b. Departure Phase:</p><blockquote>
	
				<p>(1) Airborne and scramble orders for escort aircraft are according to appropriate ATC directives and applicable agreements.</p>
	
				<p>(2) When the situation requires an expedited departure, escort aircraft are given priority over other departing aircraft. The FAA Authorization for Interceptor Operations (AFIO) is not used for intercept and airborne surveillance of hijacked aircraft within the CONUS.</p>
			</blockquote>
	
			<p>c. Escort Mission Command and Control:</p><blockquote>
	
				<p>(1) CONR/ANR:</p><blockquote>
	
					<p>(a) When the hijacked aircraft is not within FAA radar coverage, but is within CONR or ANR radar coverage, escort aircraft are under the command and control of the appropriate region.</p>
	
					<p>(b) When the hijacked aircraft is within FAA radar coverage, escort aircraft is controlled by the appropriate FAA facility. Command of the escort aircraft remains within the appropriate region. In this case, the FAA advises the region (or sector) of the hijacked aircraft's location, direction of flight, altitude, type of aircraft, and recommended flight plan to intercept the hijacked aircraft.</p>
				</blockquote>
	
				<p>(2) CANR:</p><blockquote>
	
					<p>(a) When the hijacked aircraft is within CANR radar coverage, escort aircraft are under command and control of the CANR. All escort operations in Canada are done under the Agreement for Scramble and Intercept and Recovery (SIR) procedures (see also paragraph 3d(5) below).</p>
	
					<p>(b) When the hijacked aircraft is not within CANR radar coverage but is within TC coverage, the escort mission by NORAD fighters is terminated. IC does not control NORAD fighters except for scramble and recovery at TC-controlled airports.</p>
				</blockquote>
			</blockquote>
	
			<p>d. Approach/Escort Phase. When controlling the escort aircraft, the NORAD regions and or sectors must ensure in a timely manner that:</p><blockquote>
	
				<p>(1) Escort aircraft aircrews are informed of the reason for the mission and complete an armament safety check;</p>
	
				<p>(2) During the approach phase, escort aircraft aircrews are vectored so as to approach the hijacked aircraft from the rear to avoid the possibility of being observed;</p>
	
				<p>(3) Escort aircraft aircrews are kept advised of the hijacked aircraft's heading, altitude, speed and bearing, and range from the escort aircraft;</p>
	
				<p>(4) The intercept is planned so as to position the escort aircraft at the same altitude, speed and heading of the hijacked aircraft at a point no closer than minimum separation to the target. The fighters will roll out 5 nautical miles in the US or 10 nautical miles in Canada directly behind the hijacked aircraft. (Note: Separation may be reduced to 5 nautical miles in Canada with the approval of the Region Deputy Director for Operations);</p>
	
				<p>(5) When the escort aircraft are 30 nautical miles from the hijacked aircraft, positioning instructions are confirmed (for example, "ECHO GOLF 12, WHEN CONTACT IS ESTABLISHED, APPROACH NO CLOSER THAN 5 NAUTICAL MILES DIRECTLY BEHIND THE TARGET AND MAINTAIN SURVEILLANCE. REMAIN OUT OF SIGHT FROM THE COCKPIT OR CABIN AND REPORT ALL ACTIONS OBSERVED."); and</p>
	
				<p>(6) Aircrews advise the control facility when the hijacked aircraft is detected on airborne radar and when visual contact is made.</p>
			</blockquote>
	
			<p>e. Transfer of Control Between the US and Canada. Control of escort aircraft is transferred according to current FAA and TC instructions. Escort aircraft entering Canadian airspace for the US are transferred to the CANR prior to entering Canadian airspace. Escort aircraft entering US airspace from Canada are transferred according to established procedures. The NMCC and the NDOC coordinate with the FAA and IC for escort aircraft prior to crossing the international border, if possible.</p>
		
			<p>f. Radar and Radio Contact. Normally, radar contact with the hijacked aircraft and the escort aircraft plus radio contact with the escort aircraft is required by the control facility. However, if the hijacked aircraft is operating in the CONUS and the escort aircraft pilot has visual contact, the mission may continue without radar contact. If radio contact with the control facility is lost, the escort aircraft may continue surveillance and attempt to regain radio contact with the control facility. Aircrews will continue attempts to regain radio contact until, in their judgment, the mission should be terminated for reasons of flight safety, bingo fuel, etceteras. Aircrews must ensure minimum safe separation is maintained while attempting to regain radio contact with the control facility.</p>
	
			<p>g. Escort Aircraft Replacement. Replacement of escort aircraft which must be recovered prior to mission termination will be coordinated between affected ROCCs or SOCCs and FAA/TC agencies involved. If NORAD fighters are being controlled by an FAA facility, fuel states will be obtained from the escort aircraft and relayed as requested by the affected ROCC/SOCC.</p>
	
			<p>h. Weather and Flying Safety. Escort aircrews will keep the control facility advised of adverse weather conditions. If weather conditions or other flight safety factors make airborne surveillance impractical, the escort aircraft will be broken off and the mission canceled.</p>
	
			<p>i. Mission Termination. The NMCC, NDOC, NCC, FAA or IC may issue mission termination orders. Escort aircraft terminate airborne surveillance or mission activities when directed by the controlling facility. Additionally, the pilot may terminate the mission if any unsafe condition arises.</p>
	
			<p>j. Track Reports. Hijacked aircraft are classified "Special" according to NR 55-14, Identification of Air Traffic. The affected region sends these track reports by Forward Tell to the NCC via the NORAD Air Defense Operations Center (ADOC) (Special Track Report, RCS: NORAD-J30G(AR)7403; Emergency Status Code: Cl; MINIMIZE: Yes, applies). If the hijacked aircraft is not within CONR or ANR radar coverage but is within FAA coverage, the FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) should forward position reports to the appropriate SOCC space director (SD) periodically, but not to exceed 10 minutes.</p>
		</blockquote>
	
		<p>4. Restrictions. In addition to the escort phase requirements shown in paragraph 3, escort aircraft are restricted from proceeding inside the claimed territorial sea of a foreign country or 12 miles (whichever is less) or the Mexican border common with the United States without overflight clearance.</p>
