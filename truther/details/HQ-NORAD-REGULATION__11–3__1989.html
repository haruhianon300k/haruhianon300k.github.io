	<p><b>Administrative Practices</b></p>

	<p><b>CODE WORDS, NICKNAMES, AND EXERCISE TERMS</b></p>

	<p>This regulation tells how to assign and use code words, nicknames, and exercise
	terms. It applies to Headquarters, North American Aerospace Defense Command
	(NORAD), regions, and sectors.</p>


	<br>
	<p><b>1.&ensp;References:</b></p>
		<ul>
		<p>a. Department of Defense (DOD) 5200.1-R/Air Force Regulation (AFR) 205-1,
		Information Security Program.</p>

		<p>b. Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) Publication 1-03.19, JRS, General Use or
		Miscellaneous.</p>

		</ul>


	<br>
	<p><b>2.&ensp;Explanation of Terms:</b></p>

		<ul>
		<p>a. Code Word. A single word from JANAP 299(S) which has an assigned clas-
		sified meaning to secure and safeguard its information about actual real-world
		military plans or operations classified as CONFIDENTIAL or higher. Code words
		are not assigned from JANAP to test, drill, or exercise activities. A code word
		is placed in one of three categories:</p>

			<ul>
			<p>(1) Available. Allocated to the using command. Available code words
			individually will be unclassified until placed in the active category.</p>

			<p>(2) Active. These are current and are assigned a classified meaning.</p>

			<p>(3) Canceled. Formerly active, but discontinued due to compromise,
			suspected compromise, cessation, or completion of the operation to which it
			pertained. Each canceled code word will not be used for 2 years and remains
			canceled until returned to the active category.</p>
			</ul>

		<p>b. Nickname. A combination of two separate unclassified words which is
		assigned an unclassified meaning and is used for unclassified administration,
		morale, or public information,</p>

		<p>c. Exercise Term. A combination of two words, normally unclassified, to
		designate a test, drill, or exercise. Use an exercise term to prevent confusing
		exercise directives with actual operation directives.</p>

		<!--
		<p>2 NR 11-3 25 August 1989</p>
		-->

		<p>d. Control Point. HQ NORAD Document Control (IMCA), is the central control
		point for code words, nicknames, and exercise terms. This office controls,
		reviews, and forwards activation, change, and cancellation requests to the Joint
		Chiefs of Staff (JCS).</p>
		</ul>


	<br>
	<p><b>3.&ensp;Code Words:</b></p>
	<ul>	
		<p>a. JCS allocates words or blocks of code words from JANAP 299(S).</p>

		<p>b. CINCNORAD gets blocks of code words from OJCS/J3/Combat Operations Sup-
		port Division (CSOD) and reallocates them within the Command.</p>

		<p>c. Activate code words only to:</p>
		<ul>
			<p>(1) Designate a classified military plan or operation.</p>

			<p>(2) Designate classified geographic locations in conjunction with plans
			or operations.</p>

			<p>(3) Conceal intentions in discussions and messages or other documents
			about plans, operations, or geographic locations.</p>
		</ul>
		<p>d. Using organizations:</p>
		<ul>
			<p>(1) Assign a specific meaning, classified TOP SECRET, SECRET, or
			CONFIDENTIAL commensurate with security, to a code word. Code words are not
			used to cover unclassified meanings.</p>

			<p>(2) Avoid using a code word repeatedly for similar purposes. Example:
			If the initial phase of an operation is designated "Meaning," succeeding phases
			should not be designated "Meaning II" and "Meaning III," but should have differ-
			ent code words.</p>
		</ul>
	</ul>


	<br>
	<p><b>4.&ensp;Nicknames:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<p>a. JCS allocates letter groups to unified and specified commands. NORAD is
		assigned AM through AR, EA through FF, JM through JR, and VG through VL.</p>

		<p>b. Assignment of the first word nickname identifies the using agency (see
		figure 1).</p>

		<p>NR 11-3 25 August 1989 3</p>
		-->

		<p>c. Nicknames may be assigned to actual, real-world events, projects, move-
		ment of forces, and other nonexercise activities involving elements of informa-
		tion of any classification category. However, the nickname with the description
		or meaning it represents along with the relationship of the nickname and its
		meaning must be unclassified. A nickname is not designed to achieve a security
		objective.</p>

		<p>d. Avoid using the following as nicknames:</p>
		<ul>
			<p>(1) Any two-word combination voice call sign found in JANAP 119. Note:
			Single words in JANAP 119 may be used as part of a nickname if the first word of
			the nickname does not appear in JANAP 299.</p>

			<p>(2) Combination of words including the word "project," "exercise," or
			"operation."</p>

			<p>(3) Words that may be used correctly either as a single word or as two
			words, such as "moonlight."</p>

			<p>(4) Exotic words, trite expressions, and well-known commercial trade-
			marks.</p>

			<p>(5) Names of countries, states, and proper nouns.</p>
		</ul>
	</ul>


	<br>
	<p><b>5.&ensp;Exercise Terms:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<p>a. These terms may be assigned only to tests, drills, or exercises to
		emphasize the event as a test, drill, or exercise, and not an actual operation.
		The exercise term, description, or meaning it represents and the relationship of
		the exercise term and its meaning can be classified or unclassified.</p>

		<p>b. A classified exercise term is designated to simulate actual use of code
		words and must use identical security procedures throughout the planning,
		preparation, and execution of the test, drill, or exercise to ensure realism,</p>
		<ul>
			<p>(1) When preparing exercise messages, the controlling exercise term
			follows the message classification and originator's office symbol, and precedes
			the text of the message. Internal instructions, such as the attention line or
			reference, follow the exercise term.</p>

			<p>(2) The controlling exercise term is again repeated at the end of the
			message text. Example: "UNCLAS EFTO EXERCISE FERTILE BRAVE 88-1 FOR NCZ.
			Reference Northeast Sector OpOrd... for selected routes. EXERCISE FERTILE BRAVE
			88-1.11</p>

			<p>(3) Use Arabic numerals with exercise terms, such as FENCING VIRGO 88-
			1. Also, a letter used to denote an area is permissible, such as, FENCING VIRGO
			88-1-W denotes a Westerner training area. The letter "R" denotes a rescheduled
			exercise, such as, AMALGAM MUTE 88-2-R. However, the use of phonetic words
			(ALFA, BRAVO, and so forth) with exercise terms is not permissible, such as
			FENCING VIRGO ALFA.</p>

			<p>(4) Assignment of first-word exercise terms identifies the using agency
			(see figure 2).</p>

	<br>
	<p><b>6.&ensp;How to Request Code Words, Nicknames, and Exercise Terms:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<p>a. Each directorate requesting a code word submits a letter to HQ NORAD/
		IMCA for "Code Word Control Point Officer" with the following information:
		name, rank, and (AV) phone number of the primary and at least one alternate
		point of contact and their sample signature. Such letters are updated yearly or
		upon transfer of individuals.</p>

		<p>b. Each requesting directorate must submit a letter to HQ NORAD/IMCA for
		"Nicknames and Exercise Terms Control Point Officer" with the following
		information: name, rank, and (AV) phone number of the primary and at least one
		alternate point of contact and their sample signature. Such letters are updated
		yearly or upon transfer of individuals. Use AF Form 608, Nickname, Assignment/
		Change/Cancellation Request (original plus two), to request a nickname activa-
		tion, change, or cancellation, The request must be signed by the primary or
		alternate control point officer. Submit requests to HQ NORAD/IMCA. (Note:
		NORAD Sectors submit requests through appropriate NORAD region in turn to HQ
		NORAD/IMCA.)</p>

		<p>c. Procedures for selecting, assigning, and reporting exercise terms are
		identical to those used for nicknames as contained in subparagraph b above.
		However, when reporting an exercise term on AF Form 608, enter in block 7 the
		phrase, "This is an Exercise Term." Update these requests yearly or upon
		transfer of appointed individuals.</p>
	</ul>


	<br>
	<p><b>7.&ensp;Annual Verification.</b></p>
	<ul>
		<p>Before 15 January of each year, each agency verifies	currency of assigned code words, nicknames, and exercise terms. Send this	validation to HQ NORAD/IMCA.</p>
	</ul>


	<br>
	<p><b>8.&ensp;Classification, Downgrading, and Security:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<p>a. Code Words:</p>
		<ul>
			<p>(1) When developing a plan or planning an operation, the code word and
			its meaning have the same classification. When the plan must be sent to other</p>

			<!--
			<p>NR 11-3 25 August 1989 5</p>
			-->

			<p>organizations, the using organization may downgrade the code words below the
			classification assigned to their meanings. Classify code words at least
			CONFIDENTIAL.</p>

			<p>(2) Cancel a code word which is replaced by another code word because
			of compromise or suspected compromise or any other reason and classify it
			CONFIDENTIAL for 2 years. After that time, the code word becomes unclassified.</p>

			<p>(3) When a plan or operation is discontinued or completed and is not
			replaced by a similar plan or operation, but the meaning cannot be declassified;
			the code word assigned is canceled and classified CONFIDENTIAL for 2 years or
			until the meaning is declassified, whichever comes first. After that time, the
			code word becomes unclassified.</p>

			<p>(4) In every case, when a code word is used, place the security clas-
			sification of the code word in parentheses immediately following the code
			word. Example: "Label(C)."</p>
		</ul>
		<p>b. Nicknames: Nicknames are not classified.</p>

		<p>c. Exercise Terms: Follow procedures described in para a. above.</p>
	</ul>


	<br>
	<p><b>9.&ensp;Security:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<p>a. When correspondence mentions active code words, avoid bringing the code
		words and their meanings together, Handle them separately and dispatch related
		correspondence at different times so they do not travel through mail or courier
		channels together.</p>

		<p>b. Avoid using code words for to addresses, return addresses, shipping
		designators, file indicators, call signs, identification signals, and so on.</p>

		<p>c. The meaning of a code word may be used in a message or other documents
		with the code word only when essential. Active code words may be used in cor-
		respondence or other documents forwarded to addressees who may or may not know
		the meaning. If the context of a document contains detailed instruction or
		similar information which indicates the purpose or nature of the related mean-
		ing, avoid using the active code word.</p>
