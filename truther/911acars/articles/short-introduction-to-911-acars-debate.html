			As
			known to some 9/11 researchers, the last months of 2011 and the first 
			few weeks of 2012 have been characterized by an harsh debate over the 
			ACARS messages to and from the four aircraft involved in 9/11. The ACARS
			issue was originally raised by <a href="../../woodybox/articles/united-airlines-tracked-different.html" target="_blank">Woody Box</a>
			in 2009 after the release of the printout of Ed Ballinger's ACARS logs 
			(1) released under FOIA. However, it was only at the end of the last 
			year that the most significant implications raised by Woody Box claims 
			have been publicly analyzed and debated, mainly on Unexplained 
			Mysteries' and Pilots for 911 Truth's forum sections. Pilots for 911 
			Truth eventually published two articles (2). Warren Stutt and other 
			posters on Unexplained Mysteries raised a counterclaim supporting the 
			official story (3).

			The theory raised by Warren Stutt 
			and other people on Unexplained Mysteries is entirely based on the printout of ARINC logs (4), a document apparently created in 2004 and 
			released years later under FOIA. However, no information about the 
			submitter and the release date of such FOIA request are known as today. Also, to the best of my knowledge, the ARINC logs were never publicly 
			accessible until made public by Warren Stutt on his own server with a <a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=21756&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=10803047" target="_blank">link in the Pilots for 9/11 Truth's forum</a> on December 14, 2011 and eventually uploaded by him on <a href="http://www.scribd.com/wstutt" target="_blank">Scribd</a>
			on December 19, 2011. All this, along with the fact that the data logs 
			for United 175 are completely missing from this document, the fact that the data related to
			United 93 appear to be clearly in conflict with the statements made by 
			several UAL dispatchers to the FBI as early as 2002 and other incongruences, make the 
			authenticity of this document at least questionable. That said, Stutt's 
			claim is essentially based on the assumption that the "Stn=" field 
			within the first ULBLK block in the ARINC logs would indicate the actual
			ground station transmitting an uplink sent by the airline dispatchers, 
			while the RGS (remote ground station) shown in "Target Stn=" field 
			within the ULMSG block (that matches the RGS shown in the dispatcher's 
			logs) would merely indicate a "predicted station" based on the original 
			flight plan. Not one single section from any ARINC specification, not 
			one single statement from any ARINC employee or ACARS expert 
			corroborates this assumption. Also, during our research we found several
			cases that appear to flatly contradict this claim. All these issues will be treated in detail in the next articles. Some of them have been originally posted by me on Pilots for 9/11 Truth and will be republished here with some edits.<br />
