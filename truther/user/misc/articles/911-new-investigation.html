		<h3>September 2012</h3>
		<p>
			We need a thorough and honest investigation of the September 2001
			terrorist attacks.  Here are some reasons why.
		</p>
		<p>
			Max Cleland resigned from the investigation commission, saying that
			Dubya was keeping the investigation
			<a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2004/3/23/the_white_house_has_played_cover">
			in the dark</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			And the staff director, Philip Zelikow, had
			<a href="http://www.washingtondecoded.com/site/2008/01/commission-conf.html">
			secret discussions</a> with
			Karl Rove and other officials during the investigation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sibel Edmonds rebuked the investigation for
			<a href="http://archive.truthout.org/article/gagged-911-fbi-whistleblower-naming-names">
			ignoring important signs</a>
			of wrongdoing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bush got strong warnings from the CIA in 2001, and ignored them, and
			since then has <a
				href="http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2012/09/11">covered them
			up</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Zelikow was told that an intelligence project had recommended watching
			Mohammed Atta, then
			<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/09/25/pentagon-destroys-copies-controversial-memoir-written-army-officer/">
			buried the issue.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Pakistan's lobbyists
			<a href="/archives/2006-jan-apr.html#16%20March%202006%20(Lobbyists%20purchased%20changes%20in%20the%209/11%20commission%20report)">
			purchased changes</a> in the 9/11 commission report
			to absolve Pakistan and its citizens of involvement.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are also the various doubts about the attacks themselves
			and how they were carried out.  I don't know of any convincing
			proof that Dubya or his agents participated, but we deserve
			to have the suspicions properly checked.
