		<h4>United Flight 93</h4>

		<p>It has been a popular believe among 9/11 researchers that United 93 was shot down over Pennsylvania.  However, there are 2 independent and official evidentiary documentation that this isn't true:</p>

    <ol>
    <li><p>The ACARS messages log which contains messages sent by ATC to United 93 on 9/11, shows the location of the Radio Base Stations (that sends the message to the aircraft based on the aircraft's proximity to that location), the time (both sent and revived), and the actual message.  The last ACARS Message received by United 93 was over Champaign, ILL, hundreds of miles away from Pennsylvania.  See Link 
    <a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/MORE-ACARS-CONFIRMATION.html">http://pilotsfor911truth.org/MORE-ACARS-CONFIRMATION.html</a></p></li>
    <li><p>A document released by the Justice Department to the 9/11 commission, showing the phone bill of United 93.  In that document, the location of the Radio Base Stations and the time of the calls made from United 93 are shown.  These calls show different radio base stations (which rules out the theory that the calls were made on the ground) and the last calls one of which is by Thomas Burnett shows that his call was picked up by Radio Base Station located in FT. Wayne Indiana, hundreds of miles away from Pennsylvania.  See link <a href="http://www.911myths.com/images/e/e6/Ua93-calls-summary.png">http://www.911myths.com/images/e/e6/Ua93-calls-summary.png</a></p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>It is important to emphasize that the information submitted in for these reports originated in the FBI-302 forms.  We also have Verizon and the Air Traffic Controller + his manager who attested to the authenticity of the ACARS messages log.  The accuracy and authenticity is beyond doubt.</p>

    <p>Given the above, it is clear that Untied 93 did not crash and it was hundreds of miles away from Pennsylvanian and flying westward.  </p>

    <p>Here is my question:</p>

    <p>Is it possible that there was in fact an aircraft that was shot down over Pennsylvania on 9/11, however, it was NOT United 93 but the drone plane masquerading as United 93?  </p>

    <p>What are your thoughts on this specific question.</p>

    <p>(PS: if you believe the phone calls were fake, voice morphing, or holograms, don't bother responding).</p>
