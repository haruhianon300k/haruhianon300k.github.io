		<h4>Why Mark Bingham did not die aboard UA 93...Read On...</h4>

		<p>Mark Bingham’s Calls</p>

    <p>According to the FBI, Mark Bingham, a passenger, made 4 telephone calls
    from Air-phone located in Row 23 DEF, only one of which was successful, namely
    at 9:37, lasting 166 seconds. </p>

    <p>At 9:36:10 5 seconds to Vaughn Hoglan
    At 9:37:03 166 seconds to Vaughn Hoglan
    At 9:41:20 0 second (misdial)
    At 9:41:53 3 seconds to Vaughn Hoglan</p>

    <p>(a) FBI document 302 63761. Interview with Alice Hoglan. September
    11, 2001</p>

    <p>Carol Phipps, a family friend of Mark Bingham’s mother, Alice Hoglan, answered
    the phone at about 9:35 but no one was on the line. A few minutes later
    the phone rang again. The caller, a male, stated, “Get Alice or Kathy quickly.”
    Kathy Hoglan took the phone. As she ran to answer the phone, she looked at the
    clock. The time was 6:44 (EDT) or 9:44 (EST). Hoglan recognized the caller’s
    voice as that of her nephew, Mark Bingham. Bingham stated, “This is Mark. I
    want to let you guys know that I love you, in case I don’t see you again. I’m
    on UA Flight 93. It’s being hijacked.” Hoglan said, “We love you too. Let me
    get your mom.” Alice, Mark’s mother, who was staying with her sister-in-law
    Kathy, came and picked up the phone. Mark stated the following: “Hello mom,
    this is Mark Bingham. I’m flying from Newark to San Francisco. I’m calling from
    the Airfone. The plane has been taken over by three guys. They say they have a
    bomb.” Hoglan asked: “Who are these guys?” Mark answered, “Yes. It’s true...”
    The phone went dead in the middle of the sentence. Alice Hoglan advised that
    the entire time Bingham was on the telephone was no more than three minutes.</p>

    <p>(b) FBI document 302 31805. Interview with [redacted]. September
    17, 2001</p>

    <p>According to the [redacted], a successful call from Mark Bingham was made
    at 9:44. It was answered by a family friend (Carol Phipps). Mark told Phipps
    that he needed to speak to Alice or Kathy [Hoglan] and that it was an emergency.
    [Redacted] ran down the hall to [redacted] bedroom and knocked on the
    door...When [redacted] answered the phone, the caller was Bingham. Bingham
    said [to redacted], “this is Mark. I just want to tell you I’m on a plane and it’s
    being hijacked.” [Redacted] then got a piece of paper and asked Bingham what
    flight he was on. Bingham replied “United Flight 93.” [Redacted] told Bingham
    to stay on the telephone and that she was going to get [redacted]. As [redacted]
    proceeded down the hall, she was met [by redacted who] heard the telephone
    ring and exited her bedroom.
    It is probable that [redacted] was Kathy Hoglan, Alice Hoglan’s sister.</p>

    <p>(c) FBI document 302 8422. Interview with [probably Alice Hoglan].
    September 17, 2001
    Alice Hoglan essentially repeated what she told the FBI on September 11,
    2001. She described in greater detail his answer to her question about the identities
    of the “hijackers.”
    Alice said she asked Mark, “Who are they, Mark?” She said Bingham was
    distracted and did not answer. Hoglan was not sure if Mark had heard the question.
    There was an interruption for approximately five seconds. Bingham then
    stated to his mother, “You’ve got to believe me. It’s true.” His mother responded
    and asked again: “I do believe you, Mark. Who are they”? There was another
    approximate five-second pause, similar to the first, wherein his mother heard
    activity and voices in the background. People were murmuring. There were no
    screams. Alice got the impression that Mark was distracted because someone
    was speaking to him. Then the phone went dead.</p>

    <p>If there were “hijackers” on board, it is surprising that Bingham had no clue
    who they were and was not even able (or willing) to describe them, because he
    was sitting in row 4, very close to the cockpit.
    Alice said that her account of the conversation was nearly verbatim. Throughout
    the entire call Mark sounded calm, controlled, matter-of-fact, and focused.
    She called immediately 911 and was patched through to the FBI.
    When interviewed on CNN Live Event/Special on September 12, 2001, Alice
    Hoglan quoted her son in the following manner:</p>

    <p>I’m on a flight from Newark to San Francisco and there are three guys have
    to taken [sic] over the plane and they say they have a bomb. And I said,
    Mark, who are they? I said, Mark, I love you too. And I said, who are these
    guys?—and then he seemed to be pulled away from the phone for a minute
    [and never answered this question].1</p>

    <p>(d) Discussion</p>

    <p>Some observers find it puzzling—or even suspicious—that Mark Bingham
    should have introduced himself to his mother with his full name. And indeed, his
    mother said, chuckling, to national networks that when he called, he introduced
    himself not as Mark, but as Mark Bingham. This is cited by some observers as
    evidence that this call was made by an impersonator. However, it is possible
    that Mark did so by sheer habit. He actually talked first to Carol Phipps, then to
    his mother’s sister-in-law, and then to his mother. Were he an impersonator, he
    would hardly have known that his mother was staying with his aunt and distinguish
    the voice of his aunt from that of his mother.</p>

    <p>We note, however, that he avoided answering his mother’s repeated question
    Who are they? This avoidance is significant, for if they had been Arab or Muslim,
    he most probably would have mentioned this fact. His repeated avoidance
    suggests that “someone” prevented him from answering this question. We note,
    also, that he did not mention any violent action aboard the aircraft.</p>
