	<h4>What are the most common misconceptions about 9/11?</h4>

	<p>Everything people think about it is a misconception. Unless they are truthers.</p>

					<p>No, just started a movement. Once you come around, you will understand. There is no reason to respect people who believe nonsense, just correct them until they get it.</p>

							<p>Understanding how it was pulled off! I didn't get it until the Boston bombing, until then, I uneasily accepted the government story (although I knew the buildings were demolished, and the whole thing around it was poppycock).</p>

							<p>But then, with Boston, it was clear that there was a drill and attack simultaneously. So I thought "could you pull 9/11 off with the drills of that day?" I figured out a set of drills which work to do it, and then verifed that these drills were actually going on that day, modulo secrecy.</p>

							<p>That's enough. I made a ridiculously improbably prediction, and it was verified. I am certain. My condition was that it needs to be executed by exactly one person, with no conspirators, because nobody would go along with the plan if they knew. This allows you to figure out what drills you need in exact meticulous detail.</p>

							<p>You have no pilots, so you need unwitting pilots to fly drones. You need to switch the drones and the planes, so you have to muck with radar, and you need to get rid of the passengers and crew on the planes, so you need underbooked planes, a transfer and a shoot-down order.</p>

							<p>Before I understood this, I couldn't figure out a t how you do it without an impossible conspiracy. Once I figured out the drone/plane switch, I got a complete scenario quickly, with no conspiracy. I explained it here many times. It is consistent with all the evidence I know about.</p>

									<p>You can work it out yourself, there is an anonymous article online called "flight of the bumble planes" from 2002 which describes this scenario, and I wrote about it here: <a href="what-is-ron-maimons-executive-summary.html">What is Ron Maimon's executive summary of how and why 9/11 happened?</a></p>
