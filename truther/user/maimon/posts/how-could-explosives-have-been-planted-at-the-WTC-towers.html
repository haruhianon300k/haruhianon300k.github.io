	<h4>How could explosives have been planted at the WTC towers to trigger the collapse on 9/11/01?</h4>

	<p>During the extensive elevator renovations, over the three months prior to the events, when vans came in to do mysterious stuff at night. This is not at all an issue, it wasn't particulary difficult to do.</p>

	<p>Regarding the question, the evidence for explosive demolition was certain from the day of the collapse, and it is just ridiculous to claim that the towers collapsed gravitationally, it is a testiment to human ignorance that the media can deny this.</p>

			<p>The government can't build a website with 2 years notice, but they can pull this off?</p>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<p>It's not "the government" that did it, it's one or two people. The demolitions was probably 5 people, maybe more, maybe less, these folks are contractors. When it's 2,000 people, you get much less competent, because you need to coordinate by methods other than chatting.</p>
			<p>As an aside, the government website is not much of an issue, it was just not designed to handle large amounts of traffic. This is something that happens when a website becomes insanely popular very fast, and not a lot of web-designers have experience with sites with massive numbers of visits, and you can make a lot of mistakes.</p>
			<ul>
				<div class="reply3">
					<p>If it was one or two people, why is it being covered up?</p>
				</div>
				<ul>
					<p>The cover up is organic, it can be directed without a wide conspiracy, simply using the legislation that was rammed through Congress immediately afterwards. First, you use the rendition and torture to round up Al-Qaida agents and corroborate your phony story. Then people believe your story, and consider those who oppose it to be "helping the terrorists", and then you can get infiltrators approved, the same way that the Italian Prime-Minister approved infiltration of leftist groups in project Guiso (sp?), where the infiltrators committed terrible acts of terrorism. In this case, the infiltrators just insert all sorts of nonsense into the 9/11 truther community, like "hologram planes", "atomic energy weapons", and so on.</p>
					<p>The remainder of the cover-up is just stupid media that is easily swayed by whatever statements come out of government, and many people who think "no way, the media can't be THAT stupid, right?" Sorry, it was. That's what the internet is designed to fix, these political bottlenecks.</p>
					<p>It is also possible there is a wider conspiracy regarding the events themselves, but I seriously doubt it. If you make the assumption that it was one person (or two people) working alone, you are forced to have all sorts of cockamamie military drills and anomalies, and this is what happened on that day--- all sorts of cockamamie drills and anomalies. It is next to impossible to find a whole bunch of traitors in government willing to do something like this, they will only work on your plan unwittingly, as part of a drill.</p>
					<p>The result is "airliners" that look like drones, public information that can allow you to follow the drones and the planes, and see what happens, all sorts of people speaking out about drills, and really no serious blow-back to the truthers, as they gain strength. If it was a wide conspiracy, the truthers would have been silenced. The cover up for JFK was bigger than this, some people were actually murdered regarding JFK. Webster Tarpley has never even been threatened (I asked him).</p>
					<p>The 9/11 coverup is of the same kind as the cover up regarding Clinton's nonsense, the Oklahoma City bombing. That was a similar event that never even came close to capturing the public consciousness, it wasn't as transformative.</p>

			<p>Modern controlled demolition is often by electromagnetic remote control, no cables, the signals are coordinated by radio (Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth explain this). You don't have to hide anything, no one can see the core--- this is not a building where you can see the support columns. This building was brought down largely by thermite, probably by melting all the steel in the core into a gigantic puddle of molten steel in the basement.</p>
			<p>Once the thermite melted all the steel, I am not sure that you need a large number of charges to cut the external frame. The collapse, once the entire core is melted by thermite, only needs to be vaguely helped along at best. There were probably charges around the outside to cut the external steel frame, but they wouldn't need to be enormous, and they can be put in between floors.</p>
			<p>But it really doesn't matter what I think or speculate, the science regarding controlled demolition is conclusive, just read it. Your personal "Ridiculous!" "Absurd!" is just your brain revolting against new information, and I can't help you with that.</p>

					<p>But all the cell phone use in and around the buildings didnâ€™t trigger your electromagnetic remotes?</p>

		<p>As accepted by the US Government through investigation and subsequent criminal prosecutions, and virtually all experts: Explosives were planted in the WTC prior to 9/11 by driving a yellow Ryder truck into the public parking garage beneath WTC. They parked on underground B-2. A non-electronic fuse was lit, and the attackers left the building on foot.</p>

		<p>There were explosives in the building on 9/11/2001, and making joke of is just a way of copping out.</p>
