	<h4>What is Ron Maimon's executive summary of how and why 9/11 happened?</h4>

	<p>On the morning of 9/11, there were 4 drills:</p>

	<p>
		<ol>
			<li>Put drones in the sky</li><p></p>
			<li>Radar glitches, fake blips and so on.</li><p></p>
			<li>Simulated Hijacking on 4 airliners</li><p></p>
			<li>Flight simulation of planes into the WTC and Pentagon.</li><p></p>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<p>There were other drills too, these are the most important four. They exist and all of them are documented to one degree or another, some under the names of Vigilant Guardian, Vigilant Warrier (Northern Vigilance and Northern Guardian, which were also going on that day, were something else).</p>

	<p>On the day of 9/11, the drones were swapped with the planes (using drill 2, the computer positions were swapped when they two were close). The drones were then piloted into the WTC and Pentagon using drill 4--- pilots who thought they were doing a simulation were instead piloting real drones into real buildings.</p>

	<p>The simulated hijacking begins at some point, freaked out passengers call home using plane-phones. After the switcheroo the planes are landed on air force bases, and the passengers and crew are transferred to flight 93. After everything is done, the flight 93 is shot down in midair, killing all participants in this particular drill.</p>

	<p>The empty planes for flight 175 and flight 93 (flight 11 ends up being flight 93 when all the switching is finished, that's the physical plane shot down) go land at Cincinnatti, empty.</p>

	<p>That's the main story of the attack, it's consistent with every piece of data, and has no conspiracy and no coincidence.</p>

	<p>In the months before 9/11, the buildings were rigged for demolition using thermite. This was done by a small team of 4-5 intelligence agent type people in one or two vans, maybe the dancing Israelis, maybe someone else.</p>

	<p>The demolition is probably sold to insiders as required for public safety, because the buildings would topple over downtown Manhattan, killing lots of people. The demolition is covered up by the 9/11 commission, and that's that.</p>

	<p>The nice thing about this: nobody knows! Not a single person except the drill organizer and coordinator has any idea what all these drills do when put together. This is a one-person conspiracy, it doesn't require anyone else to do anything.</p>

	<p>Further, even when it is done, nobody knows that the attack is a fraud, except the four simulation pilots. All that the demolition people and investigators know is that the building was demolished. All the air-force people know is that flight 93 was shot down. The air traffic controllers just know that there was a crazy drill at the same time.</p>

	<p>There is the possibility that flight 77 and flight 11 were switched at the gate, so that all the flight 77 passengers went straight to flight 11. I don't know. There might not have been a flight 77 drone, or it might have crashed at the Kentucky border, there are a lot of details that you need to fill in. But this is the summary, and I am confident it is accurate as a sketch.</p>

	<p>I should say that the main idea appears in "Flight of the Bumble Planes" and is mostly contained implicitly in "Loose Change", I just reduced the size of the conspiracy required until it shrank to one person.</p>

			<div class="reply3"><p>Thanks for explaining your theory and while I think it is far fetched and unsupported by evidence, it is certainly original.</p></div>
				<ul>
					<p>It is NOT that original, and it is supported by all the evidence. You need to check the drills of that morning now that you understand. It won't take you long.</p>

			<div class="reply3"><p>Great to see an explanation of the switching although I can’t quite get my head around it at first glance and so interesting that so few people had to know, however, surely people who didn’t know before worked it out afterwards.</p></div>
