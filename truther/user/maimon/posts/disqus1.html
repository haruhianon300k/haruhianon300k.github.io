		<p>I've tried ingesting some of 9/11 truther propaganda that's out there and what I've managed to sift through so far completely neglects one crucial aspect of the explosives theory: THE LOGISTICS OF IT.</p>
		<p>How many of the WTC workers and staff would have to be in on this plot in order for it remain completely secret and be successful? I'm assuming there were hundreds of security personnel, facilities maintenance workers, and Port Authority police officers on staff around the clock. And we're supposed to believe that people with demolition expertise were able to penetrate these buildings in such a way that allowed them to carry in and plant enormous amounts of explosives at crucial structural points?</p>
		<p>How does such an elaborate plot to demolish buildings go completely unnoticed and not produce any witnesses? The only answer I can come up with is a conspiracy involving dozens, if not hundreds of WTC workers who were all willing to sacrifice their lives or their jobs, and commit treason and mass murder.</p>
		<p>It's freakin' ridiculous.</p>
	</div>


	<ul>
	
		<p>The demolition itself doesn't require a conspiracy, because it can be justified as required for public safety. The 1993 bombing was designed to topple the towers onto lower Manhattan, and it makes sense to place a demolition system, just in case there's another attack. The number of people involved is very small, and it wasn't done in such secrecy, the explosives were placed there at some point, it's not like anyone would notice, nor that the people placing it were malicious. It just sat there for a long time, until the buildings were imploded. It was not a big deal.</p>

		<p>There is nothing to argue about, because the demolition is obvious from the laws of physics, and physics trumps all other knowledge.</p>


	<ul>
	
		<div class="reply3">
			<p><b>>></b>&ensp; "it wasn't done in such secrecy"</p>
			<p>If you know this FOR A FACT, then producing sworn witnesses shouldn't be a problem.</p>
		</div>

	<ul>
	
	<p>I know this for a fact because the physics is objective, and kind of obvious to anyone who understands anything about this stuff. It is not important to produce witnesses for the setting of explosives, because the buildings themselves are the witnesses. The team itself was probably small, maybe 5-10 people, the "secrecy" just consisted of using foreigners and telling them to keep it quiet, and telling commission members that they are not to investigate explosives, for national security reasons, and then booting out anyone who disagreed. Who the heck cares. The demolition is secondary.</p>

	<p>The main thing about 9/11 is that it was happening with a simultaneous set of drills. Those drills involved live-fly airplanes, simulations of planes crashing into buildings, and air-traffic readiness exercise involving all sorts of computer-generated fake airplanes. That stuff is the main reason one can be certain that it was an inside job.</p>

	<p>The reason is not obvious, because it requires you to understand something crucial: when you are staging an attack like this NOBODY CAN KNOW. Everyone has to be clueless regarding the plan, they just have to think they are doing their job.</p>

	<p>So how the heck can you pull it off? There is essentially only one way.</p>

	<p>You need planes to go into buildings, and no pilot is going to commit suicide, so you need remote control 767s. That's drill one.</p>

			<ol><li><p>&ensp;Put remote control planes in the sky.</p></li><p></p></ol>

	<p>But no well trained military pilot would even think about deliberately crashing a remote-control plane into the WTC either. So you need to tell them that it's just a simulation on a computer. That's drill two.</p>

			<ol start="2"><li><p>&ensp;Computer simulate crashing planes into WTC and Pentagon.</p></li><p></p></ol>

	<p>Next, you need to justify where these planes originated. So you need to confuse the air-traffic control into thinking that the drones you are using are a continuation of the planes that are hijacked. So that's drill three.</p>

			<ol start="3"><li><p>&ensp;Screw with the air-traffic computer systems.</p></li><p></p></ol>

	<p>But you also need to produce a hijacking, and that's drill four.</p>

			<ol start="4"><li><p>&ensp;Fake hijacking using CIA agent fake hijackers.</p></li><p></p></ol>

	<p>Then on the day of the attack, you start the hijacking. Four people are sitting in the back, one stands up and says "I have a bomb". One is sitting in the cockpit and asks the pilots to turn off the transponders and land at the nearest military base.</p>

	<p>After the transponders are turned off, you switch the coordinates of the drones from drill one and the airliners from drill four using drill three.</p>

	<p>Next you have the pilots from drill two unwittingly pilot the drons (now identified as the airliners) into their targets.</p>

	<p>At the beginning, nobody knows about your plan. Even at the end, nobody knows what happened, only the three pilots in drill two can figure it out. They aren't involved with the rest of thre drills, all the drills are secret, and nobody has anything more than a funny feeling "Hey, weren't we simulating something similar to this just as it was happening? Weird."</p>

	<p>You set off the demolition (it's prearranged, and not hard to cover up), you herd the passengers onto flight 93 (in terms of the actual plane, after all the switcheroos, it's actually flight 11), and you shoot down flight 93 in midair, and cover that up (again, an easy cover-up, considering the potential liability). That's it. 9/11.</p>

	<p>The only way to pull off an inside job without anyone knowing is to use these drills. This way, nobody can reveal anything, except that there were a bunch of suspicious drills at the same time as 9/11. You shred the documents for the drills 6 months later, and you're off scott free.</p>

	<p>But guess what? People DID speak out about the drills. They leaked early, in 2002. I found out about the radar-blip drill in 2002, the live-fly drill leaked at around the same time (although what kind of planes were used in this drill was still classified and probably already shredded by now), and the simulation of flying planes into buildings ALSO leaked.</p>

	<p>Given the complete asininity of the idea that the exact drills you would use to stage 9/11 just happened to coincide with the real 9/11, you can conclude that the drills were used to stage the attack with no further evidence.</p>

	<p>You expect no witnesses to anything except the drills, and the various modifications to those drills. Each drill, and each modification, in isolation, looks harmless. It's only when you put them together that you get a false flag.</p>

	<p>I should point out that one person was in charge of all the drills of the day, and of the US military response on that morning. It seems likely to me that even George W. Bush wasn't sure what was going on that day. It is possible that only one person in the administration was responsible, although it could have been a handful more, of course, it's not necessary.</p>

	<p>The same method is used to stage false flags still, it is the only real way to do it. So now you know how to end terrorism--- simply forbid terrorism drills.</p>

	<p>Now that you know what happened, you can also understand why the attack is crappy, why so many things didn't look right. The person planning this can't make everything go ok, all this person has are drills. So the airplanes that hit the buildings don't look like commercial airliners, they look like military remote controlled planes. This is confirmed by eyewitness testimony, and also by looking at the bottom of the plane that struck the second tower. You can easily see with your own eyes that there is an outjutting at the bottom, and you can find remote-control military equipment that is in the shape of that outjutting. There is no such outjutting on a commercial 767, and it is hard to deny evidence of your own eyes.</p>

	<p>You can also track the switcheroo on Pilots for 9/11 truth, who show flight 175 getting real close and appearing to swap with an "unidentified military plane" from one of the exercizes of that day, the exercize I identified as "drill one".</p>

	<p>You can find the murray st. engine, which is consistent with a military plane, you can find eyewitness accounts to corroborate ALL of the drills required (and more), and given that this story I told you is NOT EVEN DESCRIBED BY MOST TRUTHERS, you can see that they would have no motivation to plant this stuff, because, without the complete story of how the attack was pulled off, who the heck cares about all those drills?</p>

	<p>I urge you to do a review. I am afraid that if you don't, you will continue to say stupid things in public.</p>

<p>I don't believe it there's no way something as big as 9/11 could be kept secret because of the sheer volume of people who would have had to be involved.</p>

<div class="reply3">
<p>What you believe or don't believe about the actual conspiracy is irrelevant, because your beliefs are not evidence. Any investigation of the event of 9/11 must begin with the evidence and there is plenty to show that the WTC towers were brought down by controlled demolition. The list is long, but here a just a few of the items.</p>
<p>Molten metal was seen flowing from the towers.<br>
Red hot metal was seen in the debris following the collapse.<br>
There is one video that shows a projectile being ejected from the tower that all of a sudden changes direction. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMX7qHGEODs">https://www.youtube.com/wat...</a><br>
Nano-thermite was discovered in the dust.</p>
</div>
</ul>

<ul>
<p>There is only one person that needs to know what's happening--- that's the person in charge of the drills of that day. The way you stage it is by setting up drills for each of the individual parts of the attack.</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>&ensp;Put remote control 767s in the sky</p></li><p></p>
	<li><p>&ensp;Fake/altered computer radar blips on air-traffic control screens</p></li><p></p>
	<li><p>&ensp;flight simulation of crashing planes into buildings</p></li><p></p>
	<li><p>&ensp;fake hijacking of airliners</p></li><p></p>
</ol>
<p>Then on the day of the attack, you use drill 2 to switch the coordinates of the airliners from drill 4, and the drones from drill 1, and use drill 3 to professionally pilot the drones into the buildings. Nobody involved has any clue that they are doing an attack, they just think that a real attack happened to coincide with a set of drills that suspiciously resemble the attack.</p>
<p>This is exactly what happened on 9/11. An attack coincided in time, place, and type with a series of drills that resemble the attack. Since this is a-priori statistically impossible, you can be sure that this is how the attack was carried out, and you don't need further evidence. Nevertheless a lot of further evidence is available if you look for it.</p>
