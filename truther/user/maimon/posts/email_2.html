		<p class="quote3">Next time I am in CT, I will go to Newtown and try to find a school worker unaffected by the shooting, a parent whose child attended the school. I haven’t done this directly yet, but you can be sure Alex Jones has, and he failed. I am sure I will fail too, like all the journalists and Alex Jones, but I will try for real.</p>
	</ul>
	<p class="reply2">Did you ever do this? Please let me know!</p>


	<br>
	<ul>
		<p>Sadly, no. The next time I was in CT, I was 20 miles away, and I couldn't get a ride, my brother thought I was crazy!</p>

		<p>I left the US in 2016. I have seen photos from inside the school since then, but I am still not sure if they are authentic.</p>

		<p>I am sorry.</p>

		<p class="reply2">In one of your posts, you say that George W Bush wouldn't have known about it. Do you think it's possibly just a coincidence that his brother Marvin was on the board of directors for Stratesec from 1995 to 2000? (Stratesec did security for Dulles International Airport, United Airlines, the World Trade Center, and Los Alamos National Laboratory where nanothermite was being developed).</p>

		<p class="reply2">And also some of the insider trading: 56,000 shares of Stratesec that were traced back to Wirt Walker III (he was the business partner of Marvin Bush and a distant cousin of George and Marvin).</p>

		<p class="reply2">Thanks again for all the info and take care my friend.</p>


	<br>
		<p class="reply2">I am speaking with regards to 9/11, sorry.</p>
	

	<br>
	<ul>
		<p>I understood your point. I am guessing regarding how much Bush knew. The point is, he didn't need to know, and assuming he didn't know gets the right predictions: Cheney's office was in charge of EVERYTHING that day, including US airspace. If others were involved, he could relax and let Rumsfeld deal with his area of expertise, and so on. So I believe the scenario I told you, that only people Cheney selected knew about it, and perhaps only Cheney himself knew the whole story. I genuinely believe that.</p>

		<p>Now, Bush knew about the drills, and when 9/11 happened, he would be EXTREMELY suspicious about Cheney. I believe this explains his stunned facial expression in the classroom when he heard the second plane hit.</p>

		<p>The US is not a modern country, with a meritocracy, like modern Europe, or modern Japan or something like that. The elite in the US is like the 'magic community' of Harry Potter, it consists of about a thousand 'special families' that go back to the founding of the country and they keep tight control of all the land and all the property, and trade it with each other. There are only a handful of new additions to this clique in each generation, like Bill Gates, or Jeff Bezos. They only add you to the club if you believe in their aristocratic specialness.</p>

		<p>Because of this, there are incestuous circles of contracting among these families. Because of this incestuous circle, you expect the Bush family is involved in about one in a hundred of peripheral government contracts, whether through security or through energy bids, or whatever they have their hands in. I don't consider it suspicious.</p>

		<p>The insider trading IS suspicious. But I believe it is explained as follows: the drills involved would use American Airlines and United Airlines for terrorism drills. Those involved in those drlls, my guess is, thought a terrorism drill would impact the business of those airlines badly, as it would involve delays and diverting passengers, and perhaps it would give the airline the taint of being unsafe, even though it is just a drill. I believe the two airlines were selected because they were both union-owned businesses, the goal was to eliminate the last vestiges of orgnized labor power in the US. It worked. The two airlines returned to capitalist management after 9/11.</p>

		<p>BUT, the insider trading didn't work! People didn't even collect the short-sell profits after they saw what happened! This suggests to me that those people didn't know the whole story, but only a part, otherwise they wouldn't have made themselves look suspicious by short-selling UA and AA.</p>

		<p>These are speculative ideas, they are not as certain as the remainder of the events, but I believe these things with 60% confidence, which is not a lot.</p>
