                There is an important purpose to “online trolling”, when it is directed at ideas and does not threaten individual persons, as it serves as an effective immune system against incorrect or immoral ideas that propagate online.
                Without it, state agents, or deep pockets, can easily create a situation where criticism of blindly accepted material is heckled and silenced, even when the material is clearly nonsense and the criticism is cogent. Offensive
                language and over-the-top attacking is the way to overcome this barrier of authority.
            </p>
            <p>
                The over the top behavior crossed the line to personal harassment in the cases you cite, harassing you, and epileptics, etc. But in fighting such harassment, one must preserve freedom of speech, most especially speech which
                is not nice. While it is not ethically right to threaten people, it is a criminal offense, the rude behavior is not of the same character, as rude behavior is the most effective tool of the powerless to effect change.
                Harassment and stalking are crazy, and have no relation to this behavior. One must clearly and forcefully insist that you separate the two modes of behavior, as they are distinct, and online verbal battery is not at all
                intended as a personal threat or personal harrassment, but as a method of winnowing out ideas with powerful propaganda.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason is that the internet only works to produce truth when it is free to be as hostile as possible, only bounded by the limits of sanity. This has been clear since the early days of usenet. While there are a few people
                who use this freedom to prop up existing power structures, by dismissing the concerns of women or ethnic minorities, there is no exclusion of this tool to such folks, and their attacks are ineffectual, because ultimately
                they cannot go that far. The freedom of speech is most precious when it is used against those power structures, as it is the most effective form of anti-power anti-propaganda.
            </p>
            <p>
                For an example of a constructive troll, take a minute to read the feminist classic “The SCUM Manifesto”, which was written well before there was an internet (although in the early 1960s, the independent free press,
                consisting of self-published pamphlets and magazines served a similar purpose). This document can be read as a prototype for modern-day internet bashing, the rude, foulmouthed, offensive, hate-filled diatribes that threaten
                one’s sanity, but which serve to recast the world in an alien point of view. You need to protect the aliens, because sometimes the aliens get things right.
            </p>
            <p>
                Such propaganda techniques are important because they quickly and powerfully overwhelm the comparatively feeble propaganda techniques you find in old media, television, film, or traditional publishing (with the sole
                exception perhaps the exceedingly vicious and foul-mouthed race-baiting Nazi tracts). In old media, such crass language and over the top insults cannot get through the most rudimentary censors that block the way. The
                internet allows such language, and unfortunately such language is absolutely required in order to smash through bad or fraudulent science, to purge discussions of bigotry and xenophobia (using the same language the trolls
                you don’t like use), and to promote harmony and peace (despite the offense inherent to the language).
            </p>
            <p>
                This language can also be used unproductively, of course. But thankfully, the people telling the truth always have the advantage in a rude discussion. A quick correction such as what you wrote above, renders it harmless, and
                even counterproductive. In many cases where censored mass-media has been lying to the public, such language is needed now more than ever. So I would suggest to you to grin and bear it, and to learn to do it effectively
                yourself, because, while psychologically difficult, perhaps especially so for women, it is important. It is an essential online sacrament.

                Weev is a reasoned but somewhat angry and irresponsible young fellow, who is being smeared here by unfair associations with much more vicious folks, in particular those who stalk and menace women. You must remember that his
                _sole_ offense is (arguably) placing already publically available information about the lady in question on a public forum, where it could be more easily read by others. This doxxing is certainly not ethical, but it is not
                quite criminal either, and it happens frequently towards much more powerless others who do not have the wherewithall to write a long rambling article in WiReD to complain about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here he is being compared with folks who purposefully induce seizures in epileptics, threaten to rape women, threaten to harm one’s children, and threaten murder! It is not right to make this comparison, he certainly didn’t
                do any of that. Doxxing isn’t stalking, it’s just a bad thing to do. It’s not even the worst legal thing he could do.
            </p>
            <p>
                In his blog posts, Weev has made it clear that he is not stalking the author of this article (why anyone would pay attention to her is not clear to me). I irrationally like him, simply because he defended internet pioneer,
                academic martyr, and free-software guru Richard Stallman from the permanent unfair attacks against him. He also made a cogent argument in support of a counterintuitive ethical proposition: he argues we should preserve the
                right to write and sell software exploits for profit. The ACLU, normally on the side of freedom, opposes this, because they are worried the exploits can be used for surveillance His argument is that, seemingly paradoxically,
                by allowing folks to sell exploits on an open market, the software exploits are found and fixed much more quickly, as the price is low enough for companies to buy the exploits themselves so as to fix them. In a regulated
                market, governments are the only customers who can afford to hire the dedicated staff to find the exploits, so the exploits are not fixed, and this actually reduces the cost of government surveillance, because there are more
                low-hanging fruit. His argument is cogent, and sincere, although I am not sure he is right in this case.
            </p>
            <p>
                He seems to be a normal sane person. His reckless nonsense, doing borderline criminal things, is probably just youth. He is obviously a valuable contributor to online discussions, possibly more so than the person bringing up
                the overblown and defaming charges against him, ridiculously associating him with rapists and murderers and those that incite murder.

                Thanks, I think you are a garbage person too! The fellow is being smeared by associating his unethical action with much worse actions (for example, “come rape me” is not something he did). I don’t know the details of this
                case, I just quickly made up my mind by reading this article, and noticing it is propaganda. I didn’t know anything about this case before, and I won’t bother learning.
            </p>

            <p>
                I don’t know the details, but I am certain he didn’t say “come rape me”. I agree that this stuff is unethical, but the article is a propaganda piece against internet speech, and I reserve judgement about claims of criminal
                behavior, as it is very easy to make someone look bad in a forum such as this.
            </p>
            <p>No one should EVER dox anyone, it is an unethical thing, but I am not sure you are getting the full story.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>
                If he is lying, which I am not 100% sure about, he is lying so as to avoid the wave of persecution and prosecution directed against him, for example, right here. Remember that he might have been lying the first time, when he
                obliquely didn’t deny the doxxing. People sometimes aren’t so honest, and take credit for things they didn’t do. People also sometimes lie about things they did do. I don’t know, and I don’t care.
            </p>
            <p>
                The doxxing is a really unethical thing, it was extremely stupid, but whoever did it was just being an idiot. Who the heck would do anything to this harmless patzer who wrote the article? She is paranoid sure, so am I, isn’t
                everybody? I also would hate to get doxxed. But there’s little one can do about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The doxxer didn’t get the information by hiring a PI or following her around, he found it on the internet. The association with rapists, murderers, and so on is not appropriate, as I didn’t see a claim that there was any of
                that, except by innuendo. The association with malicious eplepsy inducing people is just a smear.
            </p>
            <p>
                If it was him, as best as I can see (with a minute’s reading), his motivation seems to have been retaliation for doxxing of others. Doxxing just shouldn’t happen, and retaliating with more doxxing is absurd, and only makes
                you into a complicit supporter of the practice. But this guy sounds like he’s twenty three, and doesn’t know any better.

                Please don’t compare, you have it much worse! She did not recieve a single death threat, nor were there any pictures of her house posted, nor were there threats to her or to her family. She had compromising personal
                information posted by someone online. It’s not right, but it’s not like the persecution you face.

                Individuals with Irrelevant Comment Syndrome (ICS) have difficulty following a discussion online and responding in a relevant way. Symptoms of ICS include posting psychoanalysis which has not been requested as a response to
                discussions of the limits of internet speech, and jargonny pseudoscience to make the ICS sufferer sound like they have something to say.

                Good, you are not important. WiReD is right. His actions are not criminal, and his sentence was absurd. He’s a weird guy with maturity problems, not a criminal threat. Especially not to Kathy whats-her-face, she is just
                doing propaganda against him.

            <p>He didn’t make rape threats, liar. You are making vicious slander by saying so, much worse than what he did. I think you should rot in a solitary confinement cell for saying that about weev.</p>

                Good people DO do that. He might not be the most sane or mature person, but he might be a decent human being. As for racist screeds, I have seen him on his blog explicitly praise a hypothetical black transsexual midget, so I
                don’t think he suffers from tnis problem, but I might be wrong.

                No, he didn’t contradict himself. Trolling is a sacrament, as it is the only tool to oppose government and corporate propaganda. In this case, you have a person who is easy to dislike, but he is the exception, not the rule,
                and he seems to be the target of an active smear campaign.

                I am ignorant, sure, but I don’t believe you or her. The reason is that people say “I think you should be dropped out of an airplane for suggesting comment moderation, an I hope you land on a cactus” on an internet forum,
                and if you insist on doing propaganda with this, you could call that a “death threat”, it sounds like one doesn’t it? Except we all know it’s not.
            </p>
            <p>
                I won’t know from talking to you, frankly, because I don’t trust your reporting. This is a propaganda smear campaign against an individual, so I can’t trust you, sorry. If you were more honest, in a verifiable way, and
                honestly explained the actual details of the death threat, I would be more likely to be persuaded, but honestly, there’s very little you can say, as I decided from the main body of the article that this is a bunch of
                bullshit propagana directed at someone somebody powerful doesn’t like.

                In situations like this, you have to give this weev character the full benefit of the doubt. He’s innocent until proven guilty. Actually, heck, in my book, he’s just innocent no matter what you prove, even though that
                bastard denies the genocide of my relatives and thinks “my people” are out to get him.

                I just read the article. Ok, I am Jewish, and relatives of mine were murdered and enslaved. He thinks I am, with my Jewish cohorts, engaged in a conspiracy to get him. I don’t know why, but it doesn’t make me upset. I know
                why now, it’s because he’s always attacking BASTARDS IN POWER, not powerless people as real nazis do.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m sorry, but ultimately, I know a smear campaign when I smell one, and this one reeks to high heaven. He doesn’t deserve this, he did offensive things, but probably not criminal things. He should grow up, meet a nice
                Jewish girl and have some children.

                his does not read like a neo nazi, but a very good troll who is manipulating imagery in a very nice way.

                you are doing here is worse than what you accuse him of doing.

                This article and comment thread is far worse than what weev has been accused of doing. There are propaganda minded folks here actively campaigning to destroy his life, people who don’t even know him, and have no way of
                getting the full story, except through rumor and innuendo, who have decided to silence and bury him forever. Not using imaginary threats from imaginary friends, like he is imagined to have done, but using the all-too-real

                propaganda. He might be lying, he might not, it is secondary consideration. The primary consideration is that there is an internet lynch mob sicced on him, and this must be resisted.

                No, no. In the 90s, people saw that on the internet, you could say “You turd-mouthed rat-faced skunk-fucker” to a top notch professor, and nobody could stop you! This made it possible to challenge authoritative statements,
                and it is still possible, so long as trolling is not forbidden.
            </p>
            <p>
                This heckling is what allows movements to slowly gain power, and it is extremely important to preserve. It also scares people with money, and people in government shitless, because they can’t abide mockery, and they want to
                make sure that writing is sanitized for approval. This is why protecting weev is so important.

                It is the exact opposite— good trolls brought more people than they drove away. The ones driven away were simply the ones who couldn’t respond to the harshly worded attacks, because they were IGNORANT. This has the effect of
                inverting traditional power-structures, and it made truth win out in cases which had been problematic in the published literature for decades.

                Trolls are not really bullies, they are simply removing authority from discussions, so that your status no longer matters, and politeness becomes a deteriment to your argument. This allows quick progress to the truth, and it
                is the principle that the internet is founded on. This principle is preserved where there are “righteous assholes”, like Linus Torvalds for the Linux Kernel mailing list, or Richard Stallman for GNU. Physicists pioneered
                this anti-authoritative discourse, it was especially popular in the Soviet physics school.

                He is being compared to rapists, those who threaten murder, etc, for internet activity which is miles removed from any of this. His reputation is being dragged through the mud, purposefully, by hearsay derived from the
                testimony of powerful idiots, and without any trial, simply through a lynch mob of malicious malcontents who don’t know fuck all about him or his accuser.

            <p>That includes me, of course, I don’t know fuck all about any of this. But I AM NOT MALIGNING HIM, OR HIS ACCUSER, you see. I just try to stop YOU from doing it, you vicious asshole.</p>

                through a lady who is purposefully and maliciously linking it to heinous crimes like murder and rape by suggestion and innuendo. It is a trial of sorts, and you are revealing yourselves to have lost your minds and lost your
                souls.
            </p>
            <p>He should be left alone, and all of you should crawl back into your holes. He should also say “sorry” to the lady for having done that bad thing, and she should say “it’s ok, it’s all over now.”</p>

                He didn’t do this, he just posted some information he found online. You are inferring that he did, as you were meant to, from the article’s long stream of suggestive innuendo and propaganda, which is designed to paint a
                picture of a stalker, without actually saying it. The article doesn’t come out say it because it simply isn’t true.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is why the article is so long-winded and has such gas-baggy phrasing, she can’t out and out say he was following her, because he really wasn’t. She’s was never that important, nobody followed her or threatened her in
                her real-life world. People just got pissed off at her and flamed her online.
            </p>
            <p>
                What he did is post some personal information stuff he dug up on her on an online forum. It might not even have really been him, he might have just boasted about doing it to falsely take credit from someone else (he has done
                this before regarding some other hacking claims, for notoriety purposes).
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s not like the guy who really posted it will say “Hey, weev, no! no! That was me! I did it.” They’d be happy that he’s taking the credit for this. He likes attention. He also might have done it too, I don’t know and I
                don’t care. I don’t like speculating about other people I don’t know anything about, and I certainly don’t follow a lynch mob sicced on them like you have been doing.

            <p>This is false! How do you debate holocaust deniers? You do it LIKE A TROLL.</p>
            <p>
                You say “Here, asswipe, are the deportation records from Hungary. Here, turd-fucker, is the testimony of a Treblinka guard” and so on and so on, you can respond to all their arguments completely, while at the same time
                denying them any respect or credibility!
            </p>
            <p>That’s EXACTLY why trolling is so important to preserve— you can use it to knock down arguments WITHOUT giving them authority or respect as you are doing so.</p>
            <p>
                It is exactly for this reason that the internet killed holocaust denial. The centers for Holocaust remembrance were able to respond to the points with enough disrespect to make it clear they did not deserve much respect.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is for exactly the same reason that you need to preserve freedom of speech online, because, in other situations, not the holocaust, the holocaust deniers are the powerful ones, and the persons trying to call attention to
                the thing are dismissed. You must not rob them of the tools of disrespect an mockery, even using the most offensive trollish language you can imagine, and then some!

                It’s not sweet, it’s necessary, you malicious carnivore. He likely didn’t threaten Kathy at all, you weren’t there, you know nothing. I know what flame-fests are like, they are personal, and abusive. When you are doxxed, you
                get all paranoid, because sudenly all the potential threats become real in your mind, because “Oh no! Oh no! They know my address”.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here’s the thing she didn’t realize: nobody cares about you! Nobody is going to follow you, nobody is going to threaten you, nobody is going to hurt you. It’s a psychological ploy to scare you, that’s all it was. It worked.
            </p>
            <p>It was never anything more, and I know, because she never said it was anything more in this article. She tried to imply it like all heck, with weasel words and double speak, but she didn’t say it.</p>
            <p>I know enough to know why she didn’t say it. She didn’t say it because it wasn’t true. Nobody did anything to her, and there was no credible threat.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <hr>

            <p>Because you don’t know what he did! You don’t know anything. You are INFERRING what he did from a malicious propagandistic testimony designed to smear him.</p>
            <p>He may have doxxed her, or he may have LYINGLY boasted about doxxing her. He has claimed hacks he didn’t do in the past.</p>
            <p>But it doesn’t matter, this is not the smear I am talking about. The smear is making a propaganda painting to make his online potential doxxing activity look like it involved any credible threat whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
                There was no threat here at all, beyond the fear it induced in her mind. This fear she is inducing in your mind, so suddenly you are just as angry at him as she was. There was no stalking, there were no real threats, it was
                all online nonsense like you have seen a million times, when user A threatens user B that he will rip his guts out of his belly and feed it to him. That’s the kind of threat you are talking about.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your anger and malice is just pure evil, and collective evil, a lynch mob evil. Unlike his non-threat to her, you pose an actual threat to him, as he is being targeted by the state for incarceration, and is susceptible to
                this political nonsense attacks.

                anyone else. Women don’t do too badly either, if they are sufficiently profane. The people who do badly are those of HIGH CLASS, and HIGH BREEDING. Those are the people that this type of internet censorship is trying to

                Since this discussion is all about unsettling internet speech, perhaps it would be best to inject as much emotion as possible into it, to give a series of examples of exactly what gigantic chunk of our internet heritage we

                This discussion, unlike the ridiculous doxing, has actual serious real world consequences, as this man is now subject to the criminal justice system. I wouldn’t claim that this was anything more than an interesting
                discussion regarding trolling if there were no consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are two consequences here. The first one is that this guy was just released from prison on a technical point of evidence. He was in SOLITARY CONFINEMENT for dubiously illegal internet activities, for MONTHS. You
                wouldn’t last five days. He was deprived of reading material and writing material, and his lawyer confidentiality was breached. This is serious, and it is potentially grounds for a successful lawsuit, if his character is
                intact.

            </p>
            <p>Further, defending rude speech is required for internet liberty. There is nothing for women and minorities to fear, as the racists and sexist folks are heckled worse than anyone in an uncensored discussion.</p>
            <p>The stuff he did, if he did it, ultimately had no real world consequences, beyond inducing psychological fear. It is just internet nonsense, although extremely unethical internet nonsense.</p>
            <p>
                This discussion is NOT the same kind of internet nonsense, because he might go to jail. It is also NOT just internet nonsense because it is setting the grounwork for policy which will censor internet discussions in the
                future, and this would be a catastrophe for the project of open participation science and open participation humanities, which is my real angle on this.

            <p>
                There’s a big difference between harassing me online (I don’t really mind) and harrassing Dzokhar Tsarnaev. If you harrass Tsarnaev with insults, he is more likely to get executed, regardless of guilt. If you harrass me,
                I’ll get annoyed and flame you back.
            </p>
            <p>
                The real world consequences for Kathy were unfortunate, but ultimately minimal in terms of actual threat. It was definitely wrong to dox her. But the picture she is painting is calculated to cause him maximum political
                damage, and this is not appropriate. Just leave him alone, and pick on someone else who is not being hounded by the government. If she wants to press charges, let her do that. This is just making propaganda.

            <p>I am defending a human that looks like a not-so-awful human to me, perhaps a decent human being, for the reason that I’ve heard it before.</p>
            <p>He is not a likable character, mostly because he does anti-politics. I understand this, as I do anti-politics too.</p>
            <p>This young kid is the powerless person in this exchange, in case you don’t see it. The powerful person in question is the lady attacking him. Call me sentimental, but I don’t like it when the strong pick on the weak.</p>
            <p>
                She did have something wrong done to her, but it is not 100% clear that it was something criminal, nor is it 100% clear that it was done by the fellow she is propagandizing against. Also, it is clear that her complaints are
                with the rude online culture in general, a culture which I believe one must defend to the death.

            <p>
                Following my own internet upbringing, and also the Sieg-Heiling David Bowie, Nazi themes are fair game, so long as you aren’t picking on powerless people. That’s exactly what he’s doing, which is far beyond the type of
                transgression I could have imagined possible 20 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                These transgressive exercizes are the proper way to leave the mainstream behind so that you can search for something new. Racist talk was something one could not really do in the past, because the power imbalances just did
                not allow one to joke about racism, with all the real racists still running around. There really are only a handful of real nazis left, and I’m pretty sure that deep down this guy is not one of them. Nazis don’t admire
                Stallman, and they attack the weak, not the strong.They admire the strong.

                the only kind of death threat you could ever generate from an internet discussion, no matter how charged.
            </p>
            <p>
                The NYT was SPINNING, as usual. There was no actual real threatening activity as far as I can see, otherwise this article would actually TALK ABOUT IT instead of talking vaguely about “trolls” and “Kool-aid”, but about the
                actual criminal activity.

                It’s not about elite, dude. It’s about the hard work required to produce new technical stuff. It’s not the same kind of work as the social schmoozing and ass-kissing you use to rise up corporate ranks, and in fact, the two
                are mutually exclusive.

                It is not clear that the harassment was done by weev, nor was there a “campaign”, there was one doxing and a Craigslist prank of some kind, neither of which produced a credible threat to her safety or her families safety
                (although it was unethical and deplorable, because it induced paranoid fear).
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s not about me or weev, it’s anyone who works hard to do actual original technical work, including Yvonne Choquet Bruhat, Karen Vogtman, Ingrid Daubechies, and many others. This is completely different kind of work than
                becoming a “known and trusted expert” or becoming a wealthy successful businessperson. It’s producing work so radical and important that you are LAUGHED AT and THROWN OUT of companies, like Daubechies was for her
                revolutionary work on wavelets. Daubechies wasn’t appreciated for more than a DECADE, you understand. This is the kind of harassment that trolls fight against, they fight against the power-structure of the bourgoisie, the
                orders that always oppress and suppress new mathematics and new science, and new computer science.

                Not false. Nobody is motivated enough to do anything criminal with the information, as there is NO MONEY IN IT, nor is there any BENEFIT TO IT, and all the people involved, due to the self-selection on online forums are
                LITERATE and SANE. Rapists don’t go looking at the list of latest internet grudges and flame wars when picking their victims, and actual murderers need a real motive. What you are talking about is just a stupid game with
                fear and emotion.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am 100% sure on this, as I have been involved in internet discussions which ACTUALLY briefly involved one psychopathic cannibalistic mass-murderer (Jeoffrey Dahmer), and several drug deranged folks, back in usenet days on
                alt-tasteless. There is NOTHING in the modern internet which can compare to the level of profanity and hostility in 1994 alt tasteless, or to the type of comments posted on a daily basis. Look it up and check for yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                I met Mr. Alt-Tasteless 1994 in 1995 in person, we had a beer, and the conversation cause me mental disturbance for weeks and months. He was an EMT, and he described things that no human being should ever see. Many of the
                folks (not me) had drug habits which were mind-melting.
            </p>
            <p>
                The actual psychopath’s postings were so stupid and banal, nearly al of them were lost forever, as nobody thought they were interesting enough to save. These posts described actual horrifying murders in gruesome detail,
                although at the time, people simply thought they were extremely unimaginative illiterate nonsense.
            </p>
            <p>
                You need to learn to distinguish between internet writing and reality. They don’t intersect today, and in the incredibly rare case that they do, real psychopathology is invisible, because it’s drowned out by good punchy
                writing about psychopathology.

            <p>
                Besides, Wallace was probably not a real racist either, aside from his public face. He was comfortable with black people as a young man. He just supported it politically after he lost an election because he was too
                integrationist.

                He has nothing against technical females. He dislikes politically powerful people, because these people are always anti-tech. It doesn’t matter if it’s Steve Jobs or this lady, power and tech just don’t mix. Either you’re a
                big shot, or you build circuits. You’re never both. That’s why he likes Stallman. It’s not about gender. It’s about social class.
            </p>
            <p>The aversion to bourgeoise class power is present in all techies, even if they don’t know what it is. It’s why so many were sympathetic to socialism, and why the USSR despite all it’s weakness, was a tech powerhouse.</p>

                He knew the effect of his actions— he knew that she would get SCARED, and that NO ONE would do JACK to her. Why? Because nobody ever does jack with this crap, there’s no money in it, there’s no motive to do anything, and
                psychopaths don’t seek out victims by perusing the latest flame-wars.

                Online stalking is not real stalking. There is no Manson here, because there are no drug-crazed followers, nor personal influence, nor any actual violent criminal activities at all. People on the internet have no real world
                power to effect criminal activity. They can harmlessly prank someone, as this guy did, and scare them witless. That’s all he can do, and that’s all he did. It’s not right, but it posed no credible threat to her.
            </p>
            <p>
                The invention of bogus real-world threats is simply to whip up a frenzy for internet censorship, which is the kiss of death. I won’t support it under any circumstances, and I consider you a traitor to the internet for even

                There are rare cases of outright racist or sexist comments online, which are quickly met with a wall of hostile outrage by anti-racist trolls. People just don’t do it very often on uncensored fora. They do it only when they
                can control the content to exclude anti-racist comments, which make racist comments go like molasses. The racists and sexist never got the upper hand on uncensored fora, they got hammered on it right from the beginning, in
                usenet times. It was one of the things that made it clear the internet was very useful as a mechanism of social justice.

                I find it hard to believe Rebecca Schaeffer was singled out for pissing off somebody on an online forum. She was obviously stalked because she was on TV, and had a tremendous amount of mass-media visibility. There are ZERO

                Jeffrey Dahmer was the exception, and this was in the early 1990s. He was no good on the forum, and he eventually got sick of it. People were certainly sick of him. Rather, more correct to say, nobody noticed him, he was
                just the worst writer there by a long shot. No psychopath is a decent writer, at least not while the psychopathology is active. Valerie Solenas was a good writer before she became a psychopath, but that was a long time
                before her breakdown.

                It takes nothing to succeed as a professional in tech, except being in the right social class or getting in that class through assiduous copying of rich people, then reading many other poor people who had original ideas,
                then parrotting these people while claiming the ideas as your own. You then will get praised for innovation. This is the tried and true method in the US. And then people wonder why so few Americans want to be engineers or
                scientists. Would you purposefully work hard so as to have your idea ripped off by a bourgeoise idiot?
            </p>
            <p>
                Doing original work is damn hard, harder than you think by a factor of 100, and it requires many years of total commitment with absolutely zero payoff. To produce a good mathematical work, or a good engineering breakthrough,
                is comparable to climbing Mt. Everest alone. Further, you will, if you have a really important idea, certainly get ripped off by the worthless social schmoozers mentioned above, it is nearly inevitable. They will be of the
                right social class, you will not. They will have time to persuade others, you won’t. Because you are expending 100 times more effort than they are on internal development, and you just don’t have time to learn to win friends
                and influence people.

                I know enough about what was going on at SUN, as these corporations produced the Sun UNIX, and other corporate UNIX. After it was a corporate behemoth, it produced the same garbage as all the other corporate behemoths. All
                that corporate crap is dead now, because we have Linux, which was produced by two independent free-thinkers who lived on the margins. Richard Stallman who slept in his office (until he got his MacArthur) and Torvalds, who

                The work of Daubechies, Bruhat and Vogtman is not irrelevant, as it required actual hard creative work in isolation. I met one of them (Vogtman) and she was amazing. The creative work is not the only work that is needed,
                other work is important too, but it is the work that is not cookie cutter, this is the stuff that absolutely requires an individual to stretch outside the mainstream, and leave the culture entirely behind. This is what weev
                is trying to do, although I hope he finds less abrasive ways to do it (weev, dude, please, please, knock it off with the Jew business— it really gets under my skin for obvious reasons).

                liability is the proper recourse, so that she can sue him for damages, and I would suggest that perhaps she should win her lawsuit. It’s an easier burden of proof anyway, she probably can manage it.

            <p>
                Yes, trolls are often bullies, but so what? You can’t handle being bullied? It’s online, no harm will come to you, guaranteed. These bullies clarify discussions, because there is no better way to get rid of preconceptions
                than to have a bullying person argue something that 99% of the world doesn’t believe. You need to consider the idea, see whether it’s wrong or right, confront the alien world view head on, and if it’s incorrect, you can
                bully right back, and even harder, with true statements that make the bully realize they are wrong. It’s not so easy, because you need to actually think about the idea, it is forced upon you. But doing this, you learn to
                distinguish between ridiculous social consensus and objective truth, you see the difference, and it makes you a better scientists (if that’s what you are).
            </p>
            <p>
                Since I respect science, and since this type of bullying is exactly how consensus is produced in science, I cannot accept it being villified. The arguments for relativity, or for string theory, went through the same hazing
                in the professional literature, except there is mathematics in there coding the insults so that they are harder to see.

                That’s definitely a crime, but the sentencing was perhaps excessive (although in this case, it does not chill anything, the impact on normal speech is nil). It depends on the credibility of the threat, obviously this one was
                taken seriously (I can’t judge, I don’t know). It is credible when there is an actual threat. I don’t see how such a thing could happen on a site with no real-world content, you are speaking about hypotheticals, and
                hypotheticals make bad law.
            </p>
            <p>
                In our case, I didn’t see an actual threat, simply accusations of such. One must be careful here not to punish offensive speech, rather to punish threatening behavior, and to do so fairly and uniformly. Civil liability seems
                the best recourse.

                It’s obviously worth more than the stance of an insincere “free speech” hypocrit who refuses to support speech he does not like. Neo Nazi speech is not even close to the most offensive speech I have heard, there was speech
                on usenet that would make a typical neo-nazi’s blood curdle with horror. I defend that speech too, although some of it gave me nightmares.

            <p>I am not sure I believe you have the doxx. How did you get it? Could you demonstrate it in some way? I really don’t believe you, I think you are simply making more propaganda.</p>
            <p>
                I know there is an association between REAL WORLD threats and REAL WORLD violence. I am telling you, “professional in this field”, that the association between online threats between strangers on internet discussion fora and
                real-world violence, is nil. The flame wars you see on sites like this have never led to a single case of real world violence, simply because there is no motivation or opportunity for it to ever happen, even in cases where
                doxxing has occured. It is not right, it is unethical, and it deserves a lawsuit, but I don’t see a credible realistic threat there. People just let out steam in hostile comments, there is some bad feeling, it goes away, and
                this activity is essential, as it is the mechanism of producing truth. I WISH everyone did it! As it stands, it is not the norm.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will not accept your expertise blindly. I would like you to demonstrate that there is a real-world violence threat from online discussion fora before imposing restrictions on these. I simply dogmatically don’t believe it
                is possible for these discussions to spill over into real world confrontation, as there is no mechanism for it to happen.
            </p>
            <p>Any credible threat I see only appears in real world sites, where people actually exchange goods and services, or meet in person.</p>

                I have no serious problem with the criminal prosecution of this case. It bears no resemblance to the case we are talking about here, as the context is worlds apart. Craigslist is a forum for real-world interactions, and
                people are looking for real world interaction in the same geographical region.
            </p>
            <p>
                The context of the doxxing was an international flame war, between parties who are geographically remote. In this case, nobody is looking for real world anything, it would require extreme contortions to make anything
                real-world happen, and there is zero motivation for such a thing. I am sorry, but be realistic, there is simply zero chance of a real world encounter, and there is no real motive for hostility.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is impossible to imagine that a violent confrontation could ever happen from anything that went on in a discussion forum, no matter how hostile. I think if you posted the same craigslist comment, with all it’s malice and
                violence, on a discussion forum, you would also get zero responses. It’s not a real-world thing, it doesn’t spill over.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know the purpose of this was to create fear. It was frightening for sure, I would be scared too. I am saying that the threat was psychological and not imminent, and there was no real danger, although psychologically it
                didn’t feel that way (it wouldn’t to me either).
            </p>
            <p>
                Further, I have to tell you that you are not a judge or a jury, you have not seen the doxx, you have not been presented unbiased evidence with representation for both sides, you don’t even know if he even posted the material
                (your evidence for this is his demonstrably unreliable bragging), and you have made assumptions of harm by associations and extrapolations that are suggested by the original author of the post above, who is also the victim,
                so you really aren’t getting two sides of the story here.
            </p>

            <p>I DON’T CONDONE DOXXING! I NEVER DID. IT IS A BAD THING TO DO. I SAID THIS TWENTY TIMES.</p>
            <p>Doxxing has nothing to do with what you call “verbal abuse”. The accusation of verbal abuse can come (and has come) for the following actions:</p>
            <p>
                1. Showing someone who thinks they are an expert that their optics solution approximation is incorrect.<br />
                2. Pointing out that the Drude model of electron flow is obsolete.<br />
                3. Explaining that Neitzsche was a racist writer.<br />
                4. Explaining the abiogenic theory of petroleum formation.<br />
                5. Describing the S-matrix theory of hadronic processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                etc. etc. Although these look like safe topics, they are all hotly disputed, and taking the wrong side, an arguing forcefully against the other side brings up accusations of “trolling”, “dishonesty”, “crackpottery”,
                “creating bad vibes” and finally “verbal abuse” in this order, leading to censorship of these scientific topics, and leading to mistakes in the peer review process online.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason is simply POWER. Criticism from powerless to the powerful is simply always percieved as rude when it does not seek compromise, while criticism the other way is never percieved as rude, period. This imbalance is
                compensated by rude speech online, i.e. by trolling.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is exactly what is happening in this case too. The powerless person is this weev fellow, the powerful person is his opponent who wrote the article, and the mud she is throwing at him sticks, which includes accusations
                of threats of rape, threats of murder, when all that she has grounds to suspect him of is the doxxing. Doxxing is NOT threat of rape or murder.
            </p>
            <p>My position is that you can’t censor online discussions period. Any attempt to do so must therefore show some sort of real world danger, and this person is claiming such a danger. I dispute this claim.</p>
            <p>
                I agree that doxxing is a reprehensible thing, she should sue. She should press charges. But she didn’t. Instead she is proposing to censor online discussions. This is not about the doxxing anymore, but about censorship.
            </p>
            <p>Further, the fact that doxxing is a terrible thing to do does not mean that you get to do unlimited propaganda against this guy. You don’t even know for sure he did it, he has boasted of hacks he didn’t do before.</p>
            <p>
                I am afraid of the chilling effect of making this guy a test case, or tearing his reputation apart (more than he has done himself, that is). He is an unpopular jerk, just like the person who attacks the drude model, defends
                abiogenic petroleum, attacks Nietzsche, points out mistakes in not using optical Fresnel equation approximation methods, and that’s ME. I’m acting out of self-interest here. You can’t see it, because you don’t have enough
                experience with internet censorship. It is simply never necessary.
            </p>

                WITH THE DOXXING. The doxxing is unethical, but this is no cause for censorship of discussions, but simply for a lawsuit.

            <p>I am not ok with censoring anybody. If he does crap like doxxing, just sue him. If he makes real-world threats, arrest him. It’s not an argument for censoring the internet, and it will never be.</p>

            <p>I DON’T BELIEVE YOU HAVE THE DOXX. Can you post the MD5 sum?</p>
            <p>Regarding your comments, I accept this threat model is true of traditional interactions. Threats can be credible in the real world.</p>
            <p>
                However it is simply not true that all online idle threats can be construed to automatically turn into actual live threats through the action of posting the dox. There is simply no credible motive or opportunity for
                real-world violence in an international forum, with participants often thousands of miles away, and nearly always hundreds of miles away, with no expectation of violence, and with no financial or personal motive, other than
                impersonal insults to pet ideas. It is ludicrous to assume this, it has never happened, and it will never happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                While it is true that the fellow is doing something I consider highly unethical by doxxing, that does not make him automatically liable for all the idle threats which were posted in the weeks before, which were clearly made
                with no intention of actually carrying them out. He would be liable only for the direct threat of the dox, the potential of a homocidal or sociopathic reader (although the probability is small, it is not zero) and for the
                harm caused by justifiable fear of such a person.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this, he is liable, and he can be sued for damages. I don’t think this is inappropriate, I would take such action myself. Perhaps with proper legislation against doxxing, he can even be prosecuted, although I would not
                support this legislation if you ask my opinion, as I think the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt is simply never going to be met.
            </p>
            <p>But this is NOT THE TOPIC OF THE DISCUSSION.</p>
            <p>
                The topic of the discussion is the censorship of online forums. There is simply nothing in this case that leads one to think that this is necessary or advisable. Online forums are useful because they are free speech, and
                free of real-world violence, or repercussions. They are simply abstract discussions of ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                The use of harsh language, and threats in such a forum constitutes a rhetorical device, plain and simple, and it is simply a mistake of context to ever construe such a thing as a direct threat or call to action against an
                individual. It is designed to offset imbalance in authority, so that an individual with no standing to argue is equally visible as an individual with authority. That is, until the exchange terminates, and one side has been
                refuted.
            </p>
            <p>
                This discourse is unprecedented, because it is quite rude, and it is free of the strictures of tradtional authority. This is what makes internet discourse invaluable. Any attempt to rid the internet of “trolling” (unlike,
                say, an attempt to rid the internet of doxxing) would jeopardize the very essence of the new medium, it would transform it into just another platform for government and business, rather than the public open platform for
                individuals which it has been since its inception.

            <p>He also might have done it. I don’t know. It’s not my job to judge him, and might I suggest it is not your job either. Why are we doing it here?</p>

                I understand perfectly well what leads to the charge of “trolling”. This charge is levelled against anyone forcefully defending an unpopular opinion, whether it is correct or incorrect. This activity must be defended to the
                very end, period.

            <p>This is simply false. The alternative viewpoint the racist trolls produce is the RACIST viewpoint, which a decent person is simply never exposed to in ordinary life, except by seeking it out, which never happens.</p>
            <p>
                By listening and understanding the racist viewpoint, a lot of subtle racism in mass media is exposed, because you learn what racism really sounds like and what the racism really is. There are subtle racist things that were
                not picked up on in the past, like the “magic negro” or the “soft bigotry of low expectations”, in George W. Bush’s favorite phrase, which were clarified by out an out racists explaining themselves online. These are now
                regularly identified by the public, and called out for what they are— racism.
            </p>
            <p>
                The racist comments may be deleted when they are off-topic, there is nothing wrong with that. But they are simply bringing up one particularly unpopular and particularly heinous point of view, and on usenet, you could always
                get rid of the racists by heckling quicker than they could produce their nonsense.

            <p>The forum for epileptics is simply a far-fetched excuse for internet censorship. It is pure propaganda.</p>
            <p>Trolling can “kill” ideas in the abstract. It can only do so when the ideas are wrong, and deserve to be killed in the abstract. It feels violent to those ideas, of course, but it is not violent towards any persons.</p>
            <p>
                Trolling cannot kill positive things, it has never done this. Trolling against string theory can be countered by two minutes of trolling for string theory. The trolling of the lynch mob sicced on weev here can be cured by a
                few minutes of trolling against it, as I am trying to demonstrate.
            </p>

                I disagree, you are lying just as much as Queod Quodington above. These things do not lead to real world violence, just the opposite, they mitigate it, by allowing the powerless to speak out and be heard, and to debate on a
                level playing field with the powerful. This levelling effect is why the free speech is being attacked, there is no violence associated with fora.

                resource.

                The professor isn’t swayed, but his authority is diminished and the truth wins out. For an example, here is an extremely important famous flame-fest from computer science:
                <a
                    title="http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/appa.html"

            <p>
                The authoritative position was “microkernels are superior”. Linus Torvalds’ position is “No, they’re not. Poopyface.” Linus won, because he was right, and because he gave the official position the zero credibility it
                deserved. Nobody takes microkernels seriously anymore.

                It’s true, these things are rare. You only think they are common because you remember them when you see them. The place where they are rarest is on serious discussion forums dedicated to such things, with open access, for
                example, Wikipedia talk pages in the days when they were uncensored.
            </p>

            <p>I contradicted myself, and I have a corn on my foot. Both are equally relevant.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <hr>

            <p>It fits both of them, actually. The contrast is that weev is completely powerless, he can do nothing except internet blather, and she can do something to him real world.</p>

            <p>The truth in the Sierra case is that comment censorship is unacceptable, and she proposed and condoned it, and still does, despite her denials.</p>
            <p>The truth in the epileptic forum case is that malicious people can actually induce epileptic siezures using moving gifs.</p>
            <p>
                Both are important to know, even though the method used in both cases was unnecessarily threatening. Ultimately, both threats are easily neutralized and dealt with, while the benefit from disseminating the truth, and
                allowing it to be disseminated without limitations outweighs other considerations, which have been embellished in this case by effective propaganda.

            <p>
                The scientific community works in exactly this way, you just don’t have enough experience with it. The insults are much more subtle of course, and the threats are to livelihood and professional advancement, not threats of
                death and rape, but the situation is entirely analogous.
            </p>
            <p>
                The insults and ridicule are not subtle, they are just mostly in one direction, from the established authoritative idea towards any challenger. The reverse criticism is not tolerated except online, and it is essential to
                have, as it is the only way to produce new ideas and let them win politically.
            </p>
            <p>
                The internet most certainly does operate this exact same way in every case where it is uncensored. The only censorship required is to remove off-topic or libelous postings, so to remove doxxing. The censorship meted out for
                “trolling” is absurd, and it is always counterproductive.
            </p>
            <p>
                The censorship of online media is a grave threat, a much worse one than weev can ever pose to anyone. Kathy does propose online censorship, her condoning of the practice is exactly what began the hostile confrontation which
                led to this mess. Her current article is simply more arguments in favor of more censorship, and they must be resisted, resisted more or less like the Roman empire was resisted, by throwing your body to the lions.

                real-world violence. The separation is sacrosanct.

                internet censorship, it must be resisted, without facts, simply by repeatedly confronting it head on, with no regard for the loss of credibility or bad association one endures.

                I would be scared too, of course. It’s not right. But the level of threat is not the same as death threats, or following, or any real world threatening activity. This stuff is deadly serious, and the internet stuff is a
                psychological war of attrition.
            </p>
            <p>I don’t condone doxxing at all. I am simply separating the threat and countering the propaganda that equates this behavior with attempted rape and murder. It’s bad, but it’s not as bad as that.</p>

                The threats were largely imaginary, they didn’t really exist as credible imminent threats, as they do when an abusive husband threatens his wife. Doxxing can carry a short prison term, I don’t think that is wrong, although
                this is not what is being discussed here. The doxxing is simply a focus for the propaganda for internet censorship, and the villifying of those who make harsh comments online.
            </p>
            <p>
                The psychological pain that the doxxing caused is real, but here it is used as simple propaganda. The threat was nearly entirely psychological and imaginary. There were no direct real-world threats, only the indirect implied
                threat that those online harrassers would somehow get motivated to use the doxx to seek out and commit violent crimes against a person they don’t personally know living hundreds or thousands of miles away. While there are a
                handful of such mentally disturbed individuals, you can usually count them on the fingers of one hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                This threat is not entirely without cause, it is a real threat, but it is not of the same calibre as a threat from someone you have a real-world interaction with, as there is simply no reasonable expectation that there is
                any motive or ability here to commit any violent crime. The threats in the real world are simply much more serious than this.
            </p>
            <p>The context of this discussion is to mount a propaganda war against a politically unpopular powerless hacker with extremely offensive views. I don’t like this context.</p>
            <p>
                The other context of this discussion is that internet discussions are problematic because they are dominated by trolls. I vehemently disagree with this, because it is the long trolling which is the only useful thing in the
                internet discussions. The trolls are challenging the authority of experts, they are challenging the powerful dogmas at the basis of our knowledge/ structure, and one must confront each such challenge so that progress can
                happen, and wrong dogmas jettisonned.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mark Twain used to say “What gets us in trouble isn’t the things we don’t know, but the things we know that just ain’t so”. A troll is someone who is trying to tell you that a thing you know just ain’t so. He might be wrong,
                in which case you can demonstrate it, but rarely, this troll is right, and then you have had a breakthrough.
            </p>
            <p>
                These breakthroughs simply require uncensored no-holds-barred debate, as you see in the Tannenbaum Torvalds debate, or in the physics literature disputes regarding string theory. There is no substitute for this
                power-challenging attacks, they are the only mechanism to dismantle the authority from an idea.
            </p>
            <p>If the idea is correct, it will withstand the challenge, and regrow it’s authority quickly. It is for the cases where the idea is incorrect that the freedom must be preserved.</p>
            <p>
                Weev is a powerless fellow using dirty methods to win propaganda wars at any cost, including psychologically disturbing borderline criminal activity. This is not necessary, it is counterproductive. All you need to do is tell
                the truth bluntly, and seek no compromise. But his example is used to chill speech in general, and this one cannot abide.

                to pretend it can. The examples cited are extremely unusual, even so they are not comparatively damaging compared to real world events, and they are simply being spun and used as a pretext to get less educated people to try

                Weev’s exploit was nothing like Kuban’s, it only psychologically seemed that way to the victim, and she is making it psychologically seem that way to you, using effective emotional writing, aka propaganda. His actions were
                wrong, but they were far less dangerous than Kubans, and there is a propaganda team of nitwits here trying to make it seem different by repetition and mutual masturbation.
            </p>
            <p>
                But this is ultimately ineffectual, because a person who is telling the truth with a few hours to spare can counteract the propaganda by simply standing firmly against it. That person is invariably labelled a troll, I am
                trying to be that person, and the first and most important freedom, the freedom to mount this challenge, is what you are trying to take away.

            <p>Sure. There are lots of dogmas in the world, for example</p>
            <p>
                1. 9/11 was done by 19 muslims, not by the coordinator of the military drills of that day.<br />
                2. Petroleum is made from ancient marine plants, not from chemistry in the high-pressure environment of the mantle.<br />
                3. Large classical black holes are purely one-way, and the Cauchy horizon evolves to a spacelike singularity under perturbations.<br />
                4. Cold fusion is a phony phenomenon<br />
                5. Self-modifying computer code is a bad practice<br />
                6. Bourgeoise power structures are necessary and justified so as to produce progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only way to challenge to these dogmas is by a discourse which is open and free, and open to anyone. The internet provides this. On previous media, powerful gatekeepers stopped you from hard criticism, and any new idea
                needed to fight in obscurity for decades to overcome this political authority barrier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hard criticism with insults and ridicule overcomes the authority barrier immediately. But the hard criticism is extremely damaging to abstract power, and leads groups of powerful people to accuse you of trolling, no matter
                what the truth is. This is not an abstract rarefied concern, the accusations of trolling occur when a person who has no power challenges an established authority.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is what happened in this case too. The person writing this article is an authority in her field, the challenge came from a powerless young man seriously lacking in real-world social skills, but strong with the internet
                skills. Using an unusual psychologically intimidating tactic, a tactic which is simply not acceptable (but applied regularly toward the powerless anyway), he intimidated an authority into backing down online.
            </p>
            <p>This was both highly unethical and counterproductive, but it ultimately did not amount to a credible imminent danger to the author, although it felt like that to her, and she is making it feel that way to you.</p>
            <p>
                The article is a propaganda piece with a goal of producing internet restrictions on speech. This cannot be abided, as the internet is valuable precisely because it allows challenge to authority. You may not like it when that
                challenge comes from a person you disagree with who holds obnoxious discredited views, but this challenge is what is most important to preserve. An accepted truth does not need additional external political defense, it can
                defend itself very well, it is established. It is the new truths, the currently unpopular truths, that require defense. To defend them requires a strong defense of those who are putting out unpopular untruths. The method of
                sorting out true from false is a long debate, and trolling is the component that levels out the authority playing field, so that the debate is over the objective evidence, and not over the politics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trolling is the defense of new or marginalized ideas against the authority of those who oppose them. It is the mechanism by which new ideas politically flex their muscles. It does not imply any real-world threat, any such
                real-world association is imaginary in all but a handful of extremely pathological cases, although it does involve a real psychological attack, in that it is attacking world-views which are dominant or popular.
            </p>
            <p>
                One must preserve the right to troll, as it is simply the right to remove authority from those who have power. The propaganda against trolling always comes from established voices with good social skills and a high position,
                because in order to get to an established high position one must forsake hard outsider positions. This is a serious obstacle to the progress of humanity, it must be resisted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Authority is what Galileo was fighting against when he trolled the Aristotelians in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief Systems of the World. Trolling is what Linus Torvalds did to Andrew Tannenbaum in the Operating Systems
                Microkernel debate, the famous Tannenbaum Torvalds debate of 1992. It is what everyone who has a new idea must do to reconfigure authority structures, and preventing it is a serious offense against the internet’s very
                structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you aren’t trolling in defense of a marginalized position you agree with, what the heck is the purpose of your online activity? Supporting the status quo? You don’t need to do support it, it’s already the status quo. The
                internet is for debate over marginalized opinions.

                The insults is a result of conservative hostility toward feminism. Feminism is a form of Marxism subversion of power structures, and there are powerful opponents for this reason. I have seen feminism defended viciously and
                cogently, it is not so hard to do “The SCUM Manifesto” was probably the first real troll ever written, I consider this one of the best models for what trolling can and should be, and it was written in support of feminism by
                a woman.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since defending feminism is basically defending Karl Marx himself, Feminism is the pinnacle of Marxist thought really, as the power structures touch on our very biology, the same power structures that oppose hackers coalesce
                around feminists. The attacks are stupid lame insults, and overcoming them is trivial. You simply have to challenge male authority more crassly than the anti-feminist trolls. They simply cannot win on a level playing field,
                as they are using social authority as a crutch, and trolling sweeps that crutch right out from under them.
            </p>
            <p>Valerie Solenas showed how to do it by example:</p>
            <p>
                “You would swim through a river of snot, wade through a puddle of diarrhea just to get a chance to screw” “You are an incomplete female, a walking abortion”, etc. This is how you remove male authority, it is no different
                from any other authority, although it seems more menacing for obsolete biological reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                The online hostility is more difficult for those who are more empathetic, this is true, but it is not a serious problem, as a few anti-empathy exercizes can easily cure this. There are fine female trolls, some of the best,
                and the defenses of feminism are ultimately easy, because the feminists are telling the truth.

                It’s not false advertizing— this was one of the most offensive posts in academically important writing, and it would be thrown out in any forum which disallowed trolling. This is what is really being threatened by linking
                trolling with violence.
            </p>
            <p>
                You simply don’t know how many powerful people staked their reputation on microkernels, and how offensive and troll-like Linus Torvalds seemed. He sounded like an out and out bitter young man with a complete lack
                understanding of computer science. This was only belied by the fact that he was objectively right, and he had just written the working and obviously revolutionary Linux kernel.
            </p>
            <p>
                He maintains this honesty, you can google ‘nVidia fuck you’, it is essential. Another such righteous asshole is Lubos Motl. They used to come from the left (like me), but now they come more from the right, I don’t care where
                they come from, I support them either way. I suppose the conservatives are trying to conserve the internet heritage from the 90s, when it was radical.

                . It might have been the first real modern troll in history.

                Threatening violence online is not ok at all, but it is not really seriously threatening either, and it is stupid and counterproductive. It naturally dies on its own eventually, people stop doing it, because all it does is
                hurt your own cause. It doesn’t do anything except make you look bad and get you ignored.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason it happens is because the internet is extremely violent to ideas, it can topple a long held dogma very quickly. The measures against offensive speech are used to protect powerful positions against dismissive
                ridiculing attack, and this is something that is necessary. Sometimes that means you need to speak out in defense of people who crossed that line to some real world harassment, because if you don’t, that line will gradually
                move to the point where all criticism is squelched.
            </p>
            <p>
                Online threats don’t spill over to the real world except in extraordinarily unusual cases, and this is not one of those cases. It doesn’t need special legal protection or any meddling by the state. This is just the response
                of people who hear a completely uncensored discussion for the first time, and become freaked out, and think ‘oh no, you can’t say THAT, can you?’ Yes you can, and this freedom is what makes the internet different from your
                TV.

                I have to come clean, I posted the doxx. Weev was lying to protect me. He and I had been lovers for a while, then one night he told me about her, and I got jealous, So one night, when I was drunk and stoned, I snuck over to
                his computer and put up the doxx. I regretted it immediately. As I sobbed on the bed, he held me close, stroked the tears off my cheek, and he said he would make it all ok.
            </p>
            <p>
                He claimed credit to deflect attention, and then to protect our secret, he joined a neo-nazi organization, so that nobody would suspect our relationship. It was a brilliant move. Of course, we could never be seen together
                after that. I moved away, to avoid the temptation. He never calls or writes. It was very hard for him to get that tattoo, but he did it anyway, that’s how much he loves me.
            </p>
            <p>
                People say all sorts of shit online, for rhetorical purposes. For example “I have the doxx right in front of me” (just a few comments above) or “weev is a POS” (everywhere), etc. You can’t take online boasting seriously.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have never seen a shouting match which ended with a lying position winning out, it simply removes authority from all sides, and then, in the mud, the truth gradually emerges, and then everyone goes home tired and more

                Einstein was sent worse, he was threatened with death, thugs went through his home, and he could not return to Germany. This was a direct result of his science. His university appointed an anti-Einstein director who openly
                supported the Nazi purges to get rid of the anti-German influence of Jewish positivists and their German counterparts, like Mach and Heisenberg. This is probably the most vicious attack on an intellectual. He was also mocked
                and torn apart in publications, including the famous classic “100 against Einstein” from the 1920s, perhaps you’ve read it.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>I call for no solution to this problem, as I don’t see a problem in her case. I see an invented problem. In your case, there might be a problem, but it is not the same problem, and it might be a made up problem.</p>

                On the off chance that you seriously are a journalist telling the truth, you should think a little about what makes online discussions more radical than journalism in the New York TImes. You should consider that the New York
                Times published out and out propaganda on yellowcake, WMDs, not to mention the granddaddy of lies, the mentally retarded 9/11 official story.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why did these lies have such a hard time online, when in the media they were dominant? It’s because of trolls continuously attacking them without granting them authority, by mocking. This is scary to established power, so
                they always try to shut it up. It must not be shut up, it must be done doubly hard.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the real problem, and trolling is the solution. The solution to trolling is more trolling, and even more, until the entire corrupt edifices of modern journalism is replaced by something which cusses a whole lot more,
                and cares a whole lot more about accuracy.

                possession of the doxx (he isn’t). Trolling is the way to get at truth quickly, and I got at the truth— you aren’t making stuff up.

                I have been kicked out Wikipedia, Stackexchange, and Quora, and there is only one or two blogs or discussion places where I have not been blocked. The discussion here is a typical amount of rudeness from me. The real issue
                is forcefully holding a position, never backing down. In the case of Quora, it was in challenging a personal sob-story directly, to make sure it was honest, and to remove it’s propaganda power so that the events of the
                Boston Bombing can be evaluated with neutrality. All of these are trolling in the broad sense, and this is what is really under attack here, with weev as a poster boy for why “something needs to be done about this”.

                No, no, you little mental-head, this is simply not true. Kuban was posting in a place for sex solicitation, with the intent of producing either an attack or a serious risk of atttack. Our buddy weev was possibly posting
                harassing nonsense together with not-so-sensitive publically available information, in an attempt to scare somebody into going away. Both are bad, but one is a teeny weeny bit worse, doncha think?
            </p>
            <p>
                The “death threats” were nothing to do with weev, they were people talking trash to her on the thread, because of her support of censorship, with no actual threat of violence, as follows: Raven, you should be humped by a
                chimp and crushed by an elephant. Your remains should be scattered in the ocean, and feed the algae, which would be a step-up, evolutionarily speaking.
            </p>
            <p>Threats of rape and murder. You are free to sic the world on me now.</p>
            <p>The impression you got from reading her piece was different, but this is what was going on.</p>
            <p>
                In any case, this is a pointless conversation, as you are a bit too limited to understand what is going on here. Online, the real concern is the shutting up of suppressed voices, and the silencing of actual forceful dissent.

                The internet does produce a much more abrasive discussion than is normal in day-to-day life, but this is also a much more effective discussion in terms of information content, and it is much more accurate when it is left
                alone. If it is made polite, then horrible and offensive lies are produced, and lynch mobs (such as this one) can operate with impunity. The trolls are the immune system of the internet, and if you have the immune system
                ganging up on you, then you need to fight back or give up, according to whether they are right or you are right.

            <p>The people who harrass online simply do not have any real-world power. This is a fact. They have no power online either, in the case where they are factually wrong.</p>
            <p>
                When they get attention, it is because their writing makes effective propaganda. Anyone can do it, it just takes a reasonably strong self-image, some actual effort to learn how to do propaganda, and a study of insults and a
                quickly developed thick skin for them. The thick skin is important, as it allows you to venture into new intellectual territory without fear, and without the worry that you’ll get lost and never return to sanity.

                A black man can go to a KKK site, and they lose their intimidation factor. A Jewish fellow can find out what neo nazis are into, and learn a bit about Odin and Thor. The Odin and Thor business, is important folklore, not
                deemed worth preserving, because both in racist thinking and in anti-racist thinking “whiteness” is not an ethnicity. When you get over past oppression, European culture is a real ethnicity, like any other, and Odin and Thor
                are important.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a level playing field, and it is simply false that the insults are more intimidating to the powerless. They are most intimidating to the powerful, as the constant cogent heckling criticism of the mainstream press by
                the alternative press online, a heckling which is now winning, is the subtext in any such discussion.

                offend me, as the attacks were always against those he percieved as powerful, not against the powerless. Nazis generally pick on homeless people for racist attacks, not on the lawyers for the prosecution. His method is
                strange. But it’s not my job to judge his politics, and neither is it yours.

                Whatever you say. I oppose prison for weev because she didn’t press charges, and he’s already been in prison for absolutely nothing for a long time. If someone passed an anti-doxxing law, I wouldn’t be so adamently against
                it, but I think current law is sufficient to deal with it. Just sue.
            </p>
            <p>I know she felt threatened, I am not disputing it was a bad thing to do. I am disputing that it has anything to do with trolling, or that weev should be publically harassed over this any more than he already has been.</p>

            <p>Nobody is risking their life here. You have to get your head out of your ass to see this.</p>
            <p>What you are risking is an open internet discussion, where all are free to participate without restrictions.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <hr>

            <p>Sorry to you bub, it’s internet times, and you can’t stop the freedom.</p>
            <p>1. I do understand the difference between arguing and harassing. Trolling is arguing and Doxxing is harassing. It is the author of this article that conflates the two activities, not me.</p>
            <p>
                2. I indeed do refuse to admit that personal attacks have no place. Personal attacks are essential for exactly one special all-important purpose: Direct personal attacks are the only method which may be effectively used to
                remove authority from a position.
            </p>
            <p>
                Authority is not symmetric. If I come to you with a new idea, for example, that black holes emit matter nothermally (sorry to pick the same stuff every time, but it’s not like I have a hundred new ideas), every article you
                read, every credentialed expert you consult, will tell you that this is false. But suppose it is not false (it is probably true), then it is not a wrong idea, it is just a new idea. How do you argue for such an idea online?
                You will be heckled authoritatively by experts, you will be made to look silly, and ignorant people will oppose you with ridicule, ridicule which will not be called “trolling” because you will be seen as an idiot.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way to make people stop looking at you and at the experts, and look at the evidence, is by direct personal insults. The goal is to remove authority from the authorities, as momentarily happens when they are insulted. You
                have to say “those authorities are bozos, they have no evidence for this”, and then the person will listen to you for a little bit. Then you present the evidence, and let the chips fall where they may. If you are right, you
                have made progress. If the authorities are right, no harm done.
            </p>
            <p>But this simply cannot happen without the direct challenge to authority. This is Galileo’s lesson.</p>
            <p>
                I should point out that authority is sometimes used by someone who MISINTERPRETS what the authority is saying, and then some heckling quickly corrects the misperception. The correction simply does not happen without the
                ridicule. This is the purpose of ridicule, it is why it exists.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. The targets of trolling are ALWAYS those in a position of authority, or those who are arguing in their name online. People who are challenging authority are heckled, but this heckling is simply never called trolling. It
                is called “removing crap”, “cleaning up nonsense”, or “laughing at the yahoos”. It is simply natural for the powerful position to mock, you don’t even notice it when you agree with the position.
            </p>
            <p>4. I don’t insist on the separation. Libel laws and lawsuits are perfectly fine to use for online harassment. I dispute that trolling constitutes any kind of harassment, simply because it doesn’t.</p>
            <p>
                5. Yes, incitement to violence is a serious crime, but that is not what was going on here. What was going on here was an intimidation using apparent incitement. She was not in any significant real danger. It was still
                unethical, it could still be grounds for a lawsuit, but this is not the issue we are talking about. The real harrassment of doxxing is being purposefully conflated with trolling. Trolling is essential. Doxxing is a no-no.
            </p>
            <p>6. I am not only a TROLL SUPPORTER, I am an OUT AND OUT TROLL, and I insist you be one too.</p>

            <p>Doxxing is stupid, counterproductive, and immoral, precisely because it does feel like a personal real-world threat. But it is not as bad as a real real world threat, as those are really, really dangerous.</p>

            <p>Yes, your sister had it worse than the author of this article. She was stalked in the real world, not trolled online.</p>

                The biggest clue was that if he had actually followed her, stalked her, or threatened her, she would have SAID SO in the article, instead of going on a long rambling diatribe about internet trolls. What is not said is as
                important as what is said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Actually, to tell the truth, I was just guessing. I don’t know anything about this. So I asked myself “what could have possibly happened to lead to this situation”. And then I made assumptions, and stuck with them. This is
                how trolls behave.

            <p>I’m not defending him for posting online info. You are absolutely right, it crossed the line to real-world, it was wrong, it was unethical, it was completely unjustifiable. I agree, I never wavered.</p>
            <p>
                What it was NOT is attempted rape or attempted murder. It just was what it was, an unethical thing which is BAD. NOT AS BAD as rape, murder, credible threat of murder, or credible threat of rape. Just bad in a different,
                lesser, but still bad, way.
            </p>
            <p>But this has nothing to do with trolling, which is what is being attacked in the article. Trolling is GOOD.</p>

                Weev’s actions DID NOT result in a single death threat. The “death threats” were internet nonsense that were separate and independent from the doxxing, and were ongoing before, in the flame war which predated the doxxing.
                You are being misled by the purposefully vague propagandistic phrasing in the article.
            </p>
            <p>
                The comparison of place and wording is for you to judge. There is a world of difference here, you just can’t see it. In Kuban’s case, something could happen, in weev’s case, realistically speaking, nothing could happen.
            </p>
            <p>The thing he used to scare her away is PARANOID FEAR of the internet spilling into the real world, a fear everyone knows, and one which is nearly universally unjustified.</p>
            <p>That doesn’t make it right, but it isn’t the same as Kuban, not by a long shot.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <hr>

            <p>Yeah, yeah. That’s what the article was implanting in your head. That’s not what happened at all. There was a heated flame war, and a kid made a lady leave by posting her home address, and she got scared.</p>
            <p>It’s not right, but it’s not a credible threat of rape or murder either. It just is what it is. It also has absolutely nothing to do with internet trolling, which is something extremely good that everyone should do.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <hr>

            <p>Yes I am, I was one of the early ones. Also, by trolling here, I am demonstrating why trolls are necessary. We are needed to deflate powerful gasbags and remove authority from discussions.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <hr>

            <p>
                What that MEANS is that somebody kept sending her private messages, in a way that was real-world significant, not that she felt insulted by trolls in a forum. It’s real-world to a certain extent, if it is email, or instant
                messaging, or something ostensibly private.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <hr>

            <p>
                It was only inciting in the mind of the internet unsavvy victim, not in the mind of anyone else, not in weev’s mind, nor in any of the folks who were “threatening” her. It was simply not a real incitement, just a
                psychological ploy.
            </p>
            <p>
                That doesn’t make it right, mind you, just not the same level as attempted rape or murder, or real-world incitement for those, or internet incitement of those with credible threat. It was just empty posturing which was truly
                scary.

                I don’t know, she is just the same as anyone else, she can post her nonsense. She wasn’t killed by trolling, she was temporarily silenced by doxxing. This is why doxxing is wrong. It just isn’t the same kind of wrong as
                threatening murder or rape, it’s a second-degree kind of evil.

            <p>You bring up really important points.</p>
            <p>
                The censorship I am talking about it real, but it can only be seen when you have a new correct idea that sounds stupid! Unfortunately, it’s not like I’m an oracle and can give you countless examples of this, but I can tell
                you an easy one where you can review the evidence quickly and come to be certain that it is simultaneously certainly correct and completely dismissed— abiogenic petroleum origin. If you try to introduce this idea in
                geological circles, you are simply heckled into silence, but I assure you that it is correct, and you don’t have to take my word for it, it was dogma in the USSR past 1968, after a grueling nearly 20 year debate. The Soviets
                actually openly debated this (unfortunately in Russian), and came to the right conclusion, and the West just sticks with the dogma. You can review the chemistry evidence in a few days, there is also Gold’s book “The Deep Hot
                Biosphere” which explains this.
            </p>
            <p>
                This thesis simply can’t be debated in the literature. But online, of course, no one can stop you. So it should be easy to explain to people online, right? But the fact is that if you wish to debate this online, and you want
                to not be quickly made to look like an idiot, you have to forcefully attack the opposing viewpoint, because you will immediately be flooded with ignorant counter-information, most of which is misinformed misreadings of the
                literature. For instance, people will explain that kerogen is routinely broken into petroleum today. This is not true, as the thing that is broken into petroleum is shale-oil, which is only called “kerogen” by convention
                with the biogenic theory. In the abiogenic theory, this is not kerogen at all, but hydrogenated ultra-heavy petroleum, actual kerogen has nitrogen in it, which betrays its biological origin (and also oxygen, of course, which
                is absent in petroleum). Similarly, you will hear that the isotope ratios are consistent with biology (they aren’t, they are consistent with small pore migration), that there are biomarkers (these are bacterial residues from
                archaea), that there are fossils in coal (the fossils were there before the rock turned to coal), that the He has an explanation (it doesn’t, as the He concentrations can range to 1000 times the surrounding rocks), that the
                chemical path to petroleum is understood (a lie only said by ignorant people), and so on, a whole bunch of nonsense, but all of it is backed up with the pseudo authority of misunderstood references and opinions of big shots.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because this is a disputed topic where all the (Western) experts are demonstrably wrong, it is impossible for anyone with the correct scientific hypothesis to get heard using any standard accepted method of debate. The best
                way to get heard in this circumstance is to simultaneously rebut the arguments, and present the case disrespectfully, so that the authority of the experts is diminished with each rebuttal. Then once you rebut all the points,
                you are done, you win. The insults serve to remove the authority from the experts, so that the only authority that remains is that which is supported by factual evidence. This is unfortunately the only effective way to
                debate an ossified point where all authorities are wrong. It is codified as a rule of physics discourse.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the start of this process, you look like the most unconstructive of idiots, and a complete troll (you are). But this is what happens when you have an unpopular idea, you always look like an idiot, whether it is correct or
                incorrect. This is the “Galileo problem”, and it is fixed with trolling. Galileo also fixed it with a form of trolling, Simplicio is mocking the Aristotelians. At the end, you simply look like you were right, and your
                victory was inevitable. But it was not at all inevitable, you don’t get anywhere without trolling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, what “trolling” means in an internet context is a stream of personal insults directed at an individual which hurts their feelings. It is mockery which removes or denies authority to an individual. An example would be
                “You mental reject, of course the biomarkers in petroleum come from underground archaea”. This type of discourse is forbidden in professional journals, at least when the other side is powerful. It is tacitly accepted in
                chit-chat and in referee reports when the other side is powerless (“Yeah, you know, he’s one of them abiogenic yahoos”, “Those guys are crazy”, “They don’t have a leg to stand on”, etc). Online, trolling quickly levels the
                playing field, allowing the ideas to battle on equal footing. Then the correct idea quickly wins, and you’re back to normal.
            </p>
            <p>The article makes the subversive authority denying practice of trolling look like a form of personal harrassment, by focusing on actual harrassment, and ridiculously linking it “trolling”.</p>
            <p>
                People can moderate, sure, but it is best if this is minimal, and self-correcting. I am active on a site called “physicsoverflow”, and the way that physicsoverflow deals with it is “spam is deleted, irrelevant stuff is
                deleted, and anything with physics content is preserved, although if it is off the wall, it is moved to chat” This model might work in greater generality.

                Doxxing is not 100% safe, but the risk is INFINITESIMAL compared to any real threat. The article compares it to incitement to murder or invitation to rape. The article is mentally retarded propaganda, it might as well have

                I am not happy with this at all. Requiring civility is simply a sell-out, and a complete perversion of what the internet is. Being uncivil is not a crime, it is a sacrament, and the conflating of incivility with crimes is
                the central problem with discussions of internet behavior.

                Hi Guest dude. “Sheldon Cooper” is an (offensive) caricature of me and all other physicists. If I had to guess, I would guess the model for Sheldon was either Lubos Motl or the physicist character in Woody Allen’s movie with
                that bald Seinfeld creator. Unlike Sheldon, Allen’s character is not a caricature.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheldon Cooper is out and out mockery by the bourgeoise media of the honest no-nonsense physicist discourse, which is extremely rude and direct, by linking it to psychopathology. For the same essential reason, this article
                is trying to link trolling to psychopathology. “Trolling” is simply physics culture exported to the rest of the world, it’s what good physicists have been doing to each other since at least the 1920s, and it’s how the field
                stays honest and makes progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                They don’t have any mental disorders or autism. Although I know it’s hard to believe, physicists behave that way ON PURPOSE, to make sure that bullshit doesn’t take over their field. It’s also kind of Soviet, as in the
                Soviet Union, bourgeoise phoniness was not necessary (you needed other kinds of phoniness), and direct challenge of authority (not government authority, your boss’s authority) was common.
            </p>
            <p>
                Negative peer review is another form of trolling, except hidden away so that you never see it. I don’t like private peer review, I prefer public peer review, because private peer review leads to something like this getting
                rejected:

                (nonsense that cited the right people). The fix is public peer review, where these mistakes are automatically corrected. That’s what the internet is for.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason one needs firm protection for what people identify as abusive behavior is because there are cases where one is NOT wrong, and yet people persist in thinking that one is, because of a cloud of authority. A few well
                placed insults removes all authority, and then after the insults start to fly, both sides present their case, and the objective truth becomes obvious to everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without the insults, there is no particular reason for truth to win, only authority matters. With insults, it can’t help but win, because only accuracy matters. That’s the lesson physicists learned, and it’s why we ran
                circles around all the other academic fields and still do.

                He’s trolling, he’s been trolling the whole discussion. It’s hopeless to explain why trolling is required to people who know nothing about trolling. The only thing you can do is just to keep on trolling, and hope they get
                it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why is it hard to explain trolling? Because people just don’t usually see the authority structures that trolls are subverting by direct rude opposition, as these authority structures are invisible until you either have a old
                bad idea or a good new idea, at either of which points you feel them harshly pushing back at you.
            </p>
            <p>
                If all you’ve had are bad old ideas, the pushing back seems like a great thing, it’s a lot of heckling and abuse that serves to put you back on track. It’s only when you have a good new ideas that you see that the heckling
                doesn’t care about right and wrong at all, rather only about authority, and it is equally used to silence new folks who are right as new folks who are wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                The internet can overcome this, by merely providing a space for people to explain themselves, and to counteract the authority of received wisdom. The problem is that you get a mass of ignorant people coming at you like a
                tidal wave, each of them trying to defend the established orthodoxy. So you need to get rid of their authority, by harsh language, by calling them names, so that they lose that mantle of authority they get from parrotting
                something you already heard before.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trolling is there to protect important good new ideas, unpopular ideas, from authority. That’s its only purpose. But how can you explain this here? It’s next to impossible. So I suppose all you can do is just provide
                trolling examples and hope it sinks in.

                I am choosing these two, because I don’t know anything about this stuff, I am not Western European and honestly I find pre-Christian Western European culture hokey, I am not a big fan of Alistair Crowley. But hokey or not so
                hokey, it’s a distinct ethnic culture, and it gives insight into literature and culture, and its worth preserving. These two, Odin and Thor, are ones weev talked about. Loki sounds better, as you say.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think they are suppressed in the same sense that Irish culture was suppressed in the 18th century, before the famine. Through political pressure to abandon this and join the majority Christian culture. This is ultimately
                what Nietzsche and Hitler were basing their movement on. Of course Christianity is vastly more important, but the pagan heritage didn’t really have a voice, as it was always commingled with Hitler style race-hatred, at least
                in the early half of the twentieth century. It seems to be separating from this today.
            </p>
            <p>
                I do feel connected with these groups because they are persecuted and marginalized (justly, because American and European racism is a more serious problem than neglect of pagan culture), it’s certainly not because I agree
                with them. I read their material while doing quick online research to make sure the holocause actually did happen as stated. At some point I became skeptical of the story, because I grew up in Israel surrounded by victims,
                so I was never exposed to the opinion of the perpetrators, for obvious reasons. After a few hours of searching, I found good firsthand documents from Pressac and good firsthand perpetrator testimony, from next generation
                Germans, which made it clear that the mainstream narrative is actually correct. The Odin and Thor cults were weird things that explained to me where these groups get their legs from. They really need to separate this stuff
                from racial hatred and white supremacy, so that it can just exist without being evil, oppressive, racist, or satanic.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like powerless people with an opinion, because I know they didn’t get this opinion by following the mainstream, although this particular opinion, of course, I could live without. So I look to see “what could possibly be
                worth salvaging in their brain damage?” And the stuff I find interesting is their focus on Western European ethnicity. Loki is good too, I suppose.

                Yes, I know she had a breakdown, probably drug induced, it’s was the destruction of a great voice. SCUM wasn’t the cause, this was many years later. It was probably drugs, alienation, and personal money problems between her
                and Warhol, and it’s a terrible story. I didn’t know she was a schitzophrenic, the story is more plausible now, I couldn’t figure out how such an enlightened writer became an attempted murderer.
            </p>
            <p>
                That drug induced conversion of alternative viewpoints into homicidal rage happened a lot in the 1960s, for example, the SDS to the Weathermen, which finally ended with that horrible Brinks holdup in 1980 which murdered a
                security guard. That’s the main problem of the 1960s— what mechanism do you have to allow the speech, while preventing the violence?
            </p>
            <p>
                The solution was found in 1969, but nobody noticed for a while. The internet is the solution to this problem. This is why trollings place is online, where such things have to surmount a nearly insurmountable barrier to ever
                spill over into violence.
            </p>
            <p>The internet allows the humanities revolutions and also the scientific revolutions of the 1960s to be widely understood and accepted without the violence and drug damage that destroyed it.</p>

                The exceptions were professional asshole physicists. These serve as role models: Eric Siggia, Philip Argyres, and a few others like Henry Tye and David Gross. These people throw poop, but they would usually throw more

                You are completely wrong, you have clearly not actually spent “hours” arguing with racists, as you would have slowly seen that they don’t make such facile arguments in an unending stream. They intersperse it with reasoning,
                which is approximately self-consistent and self-reinforcing. Further, the more exposure you have to this, the better you get at spotting subtle versions of it in media. Yes, online it’s sometimes less subtle, but the same
                people will produce a continuum of racism going from overt to subtle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Seeing this stuff and talking to those people in depth is what makes you realize that the attitude is held by ordinary people, not space aliens. As they continue discussing, they move from overt threats to explain subtler
                points. For example, ask a racist what is their favorite portrayal of a black character in film? If they point you to “Gone With The Wind” you learned something about that film. Ask them what is their favorite tool for
                arguing white supremacy, and they will point at the IQ test. You learn something about what that test is all about. It’s informative to argue with racists, at least until they start repeating themselves, and them it gets
                boring. This happens very fast.

                Yes, the threats of violence are completely counterproductive, but this is simply not what was going on. The threat of violence is being invented by the author to give a pretext argue against heated language in general,
                saying that the “feeling of violence” which is the response to impolite language and forceful disagreement. That always feels like violence, and this is what the battle against internet trolling is trying to silence.

                There was a threat of violence implied by doxxing, and this is why doxxing is not useful or productive. But it isn’t really a real world threat of violence either, it is just something that hackers think will help when they
                are young and stupid. They know that an internet unsavvy person will be scared to death by this stuff, without any real signifcant danger.

                restrained always skirting the border of the point of no return, and the abuse is directed only at powerful people, namely the judge and prosecution in his case. The only praise he gives to white supremacists is oblique
                praise of their preservation of Western European folklore, which is really the only nice thing you can say about them.

            <p>Unlike your other facile attempts to find contradiction, this one is legitimate. But it’s not because truth is “protean” and “polymorphous”, it’s because I didn’t know anything when I started.</p>
            <p>
                What I did know is that the folks commenting here are supporting a (wrong) majority view, which is that politeness is good. Weev is supporting a (correct) minority view that politeness is bad. I expect a reasoned debate over
                this, with actual ideas exchanged.
            </p>
            <p>
                But online, when there is a majority view, there is a numbers imbalance, and people like to chip in with their nonsense supporting the majority view. So you will get a whole avalanche of comments supporting it from people
                who don’t have any independent opinion, who don’t have any actual argument, and who wouldn’t know what an actual argument looks like even if it bit them on the leg.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way to deal with this is to attack them personally, until they start to come back with more substantial material which actually does have some meat in it. The “abuse”, “malice”, “lynch mob mentality” etc of my comments
                were designed to get these people to accept what they are, which is a collective mob with no independent thinking. Now you are coming back with me making a factual mistake, and a real inconsistency. GOOD. Trolling
                successful, you are now making an effective grown up argument, rather than an emotional laden feel-good reinforcement of majority opinion.
            </p>
            <p>You are also totally right, and it’s the first time I’ve voted up your comments. These discussions in reality, as you say, pose no threat to weev in Lebanon or wherever he is. I was wrong on that point.</p>

                But, really, I got it wrong because I didn’t know anything about this two days ago, and I thought he was in jail somewhere, or getting prosecuted, due to insufficient familiarity with the story. But IGNORANCE DOES NOT STOP
                ME, as I am A TROLL doing COUNTERPROPAGANDA. It’s the other side’s job to find out when I made a mistake, good job.
            </p>

                “Nearly insurmountable” is enough. What weev did can’t be compared in severity to what Kuban did, sorry. That’s just rhetoric. It only felt psychologically similar to the victim. None of these are reasonable cases to base
                your policy on, the barrier to violence is really nearly insurmountable.

                He has a certain amount of Jewish ancestry, and his racist rant attacks with the wrong power perspective from racism, by placing others in a position of power, and attacking from the position of the powerless. This is not

                It’s not exactly a comeback, it’s a personal insult, like, say, calling you a roach. Insults are just there to chip away at your social confidence, roach. They work sort of like an ice-pick at a phallus, the blood drains and
                then the thing wilts. Roach.

                The “documentation” you claim for a rape-threat is statements coming from the New York Times, which sounds pretty authoritative for a second, until you realize that the New York Times has been approximately as reliable as my

                What he claimed to have done, according to the article, is release information about the woman which included her home address, together with hateful material which made her feel threatened personally. This was not
                appropriate at all, it’s wrong, but it is in no way tantamount to a credible threat of rape, no matter how it was spun by the media.
            </p>
            <p>
                She got scared, it was wrong, I think this is not acceptable in any way, but that’s not the same level of threat as a stalker, or a real personal harrassment death-threat or rape-threat online. Those are simply much more

                It is the first time such a thing has been done, that’s true. I wouldn’t have thought it is possible to get away with, yes. But, shocked as I am, that swastika is sitting reasonably ok with me, it is so borderline, I keep
                dizzily going back and forth, back and forth, it still makes me queasy every once in a while. The thing is, it is really not being used to rail against the powerless at any point. Racism is about power, and weev always
                points the gun in the right direction. I genuinely think he might have been able to do it while staying in the kingdom of troll, without tripping over into the kingdom of hell. But he might not. I really don’t know for sure.
                That’s part of what makes him such an effective troll. I can’t tell, honest, I still can’t tell. But then I reserve judgement. But the very fact that one can’t tell, even with a swastika, and a long racial rant on a racist
                publication accepted without reservation, this speaks volumes— that doesn’t happen in the normal world, this is a special kind of black magic.

            <p>Trolling is a sacrament on the internet, as it is the mechanism by which you remove authority from discussions, and it is how you DIFFUSE LYNCH MOBS, like the nice little circle jerk of consensus you have here.</p>
            <p>
                Trolls break consensus, by inserting contrary opinion. They buck the group, they subvert authority. This is required for the internet to function as a medium which has something to say which is different from what has been
                said before, or is repeated ad-nauseum everywhere else.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without trolling, the internet turns into a chattier less eloquent version of “The Morning Circle of Joe and Friends” old media nonsense. You get people repeating the same bullcrap they hear on old media, and you get nothing
                subversive, nothing new, and nothing interesting. The internet trolls convert consensus to discord, and in the discord new ideas flourish and old ideas just become embarassing to hold.
            </p>
            <p>
                You don’t have to worry about protecting the status quo, if it is justified, it will reform itself unharmed after any challenge. The thing you need to worry about is a mob of folks silencing alternative viewpoints with
                one-way heckling which cannot be answered or rebutted. Because only insults in one direction are deemed “trolling”, insults in the other direction are deemed “getting rid of the troll”. The easy direction for insults is the
                direction of greater to lesser authority. The trolling is the insult going in the opposite direction. You need both directions to function in order for the authority to be neutralized, and the discussion to be at an
                appropriately high level. Both directions, or neither, but the direct and veiled insults from powerful to powerless are so natural, that to remove them is utopian fantasy.
            </p>
            <p>It is so essential for the functioning of honest peer-reviewing community online, that trolling online is one of the pillars of human existence, like charity, kindness, and goodwill to all.</p>

            <p>The troll wasn’t dangerous, you are just being made to think so.</p>
            <p>
                Online, when there is a majority opinion, trolling breaks through the miasma of authority to shine a clear light on the evidence and allow it to speak for itself. Without the trolling, authority clouds the discussion, and
                nothing can progress, no matter what the objective facts may be.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can explain something, but a horde of locusts come in and tell you that you are wrong, with authoritative citations. You need to be able to say “shut up, all of you. You’re retarded.” And not get kicked out, then present
                the evidence, and then let the people evaluate it neutrally, now that authority is neutralized.
            </p>
            <p>That’s what trolls are for, to neutralize authority.</p>

                But you are sincere, you have a valid point, you are also (probably) a woman and know more about the level of threat this poses. I would be able to cut the difference and say I agree, more or less. Minus the exaggerations.
                It is likely that the level of threat is greater because of the gender issues, and it is possible that I am blind to it because I am a dude, and because I only care about freedom of speech.

                metal? There’s nothing here which isn’t completely repulsive except Thor, Grimm, fondue and yodeling. When I was young, I couldn’t understand how ANYONE could possibly get into this Nazi stuff, even with all its implied
                priviledge, for any reason other than being born evil. But of course nobody is evil in the genes, 1968 Germany was not caused by gamma rays from space. But 1930s Germany wasn’t all about fondue and yodeling either.
            </p>
            <p>
                I suspect (without evidence) it’s this way: People always look for an identity. They reject the Christian identity, for one reason or another, probably because they like to have sex. So they find the pre-Christian Western
                European thing, where you could have sex whenever you felt like it.
            </p>
            <p>
                So now you have a bunch of repressed people who hate the Jews because they think all that repression is the Jews’ fault. That is, if those Jews didn’t exist, there wouldn’t be any Christianity, everyone would be pagan, and
                they would be having sex-orgies.
            </p>
            <p>
                They don’t blame the actual European Christians that spread the Christian religion, because if it was really non-Jews spreaing this out of necessity, you know, like the historical record describes, then that means that
                monotheism would be an inevitable process, the inevitable outcome of human social evolution. Since it can’t be, because it makes people so miserably repressed, it has to be some imposition by other people. So they think it’s
                the Jews’ fault, because, you know, look at the Bible. If that was your only source for the history of religion, what would you think?
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s easy, because the scriptures make Christianity look more Jewish than it really is, and make the God concept look like it’s owned by Jews in some special way which of course it’s not. So the Jew hatred is really special,
                there’s nothing the Jews can do to fix it, because it’s really God hatred, accidentally redirected due to the content of the only holy book they have.
            </p>
            <p>
                So the Nazis really think there’s a defective monotheistic gene hidden inside the Jewish chromosomes that tells Jews to lie to people about the monotheistic business, and then Jews use their “unique genius of persuasion” (in
                Neitzsche’s term) to make the whole world monotheistic. They think this monotheistic gene just needs to be eradicated, and for things to go back to pagan times, with orgies and slaves and gladiator games, and all that
                wonderful stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                They hate on other races for a much more banal reason, simply because these pagan traditions don’t consider humanity as one unit, bound under one universal ethical notion, but rather each little clan has its own gods, and
                those gods take care only of their own members. They enslave and use other clans for whatever purpose, as they are not under the protection of their specific tribal deity. This means that they look for any opportunity to
                demean and exploit others, and then you get all the rest of the horror. They like you less and less the less you look like a European, because, you know, that means your god looks less and less like thier god. It’s really
                that shallow.
            </p>
            <p>
                They also imagine this paganism is secretly what Jews believe in private, and that the Jewish religion is publically monotheistic, but secretly pagan, and Jews are doing terrible things to others in secret rituals. This is
                what historical anti-semitism says about Jews, for completely different reasons. So now they hate the Jews even more, and everyone else can go to hell too, and that’s Naziism.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t see any other coherent motivation for the peculiar convergence of unique crazy ideas that come together in Nazi ideology, other than restoring the pre-Christian Europe, and ridding it of the “Jewish influence” of
                Christianity. It was a great puzzle to me where these ideas come from, these things weren’t invented by Hitler— he wasn’t very imaginative. I think it’s a Nietzchian attempt to get Christianity out of Europe, and then kill
                the Jews so that they don’t whip up another Jesus or something (as if you specifically needed Jews to do that). But Nietzsche wasn’t very imaginative either
            </p>
            <p>
                Since Marxism is a sort of Christianity 2.0, with modern capitalism replacing the Roman system, and since 2.0 was trying to replace 1.0, 1.0 was really weak in the 1930, and so the Nazis saw a chace to flush the whole thing
                down the toilet and go back to version 0.0. But of course, anyone who was going by 1.0 or 2.0 (or who had any decency) joined together and eradicated this crap.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then you can blame two things: the suppression of sex, and the suppression of Odin and Thor. The first is more or less quickly solved in a few decades postwar, anyone can do pretty much whatever without too much
                interference. But the second is still there, motivating a little bit of residual neo-nazism. I think that once Odin and Thor are respected a little bit, you won’t have any more of this cancer.
            </p>
            <p>Also, weev focuses only on this aspect, the Odin and Thor, which, being the most innocuous aspect of this whole set of beliefs, makes me think he isn’t sincere in this business.</p>

                . Unlike other people here, I don’t make crap up for rhetorical purposes. Now you can conclude from this that he is lying somewhere. Here is an informative pre-prison interview:
                <a title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37oBowW7vyQ" href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D37oBowW7vyQ%3AEQMBkpqNKJveMXy68bIcHpgqx3c&amp;cuid=187837" rel="nofollow noopener">

                . However, earlier videos I have seen show a person who is somewhat deranged in a Bobby Fischer way, railing about Jewish this and Jewish that. It’s difficult to know what is sincere, because the attitudes change from
                instance to instance, this is unforunately a symptom of drug abuse and lack of a solid center.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think it is next to impossible to be aware of power structures in society to the extent that he is and simultaneously be a racist, it’s like knowing calculus and simultaneously failing to realize that a product of two odd
                numbers is always odd. It’s logically possible, sure, but it’s difficult to imagine. Racism of any kind is really, really, primitive.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not 100% sure on his position, one of the problems with drugs is that drug addled people don’t have a consistent position from moment to moment, it all depends on the details of the momentary brain chemistry. but the
                sophisticated awareness of power and trolling makes it unlikely. By the way, being one quarter Jewish, or even half Jewish (like Fischer), or full Jewish (like Fischer, really) does not immunize you to the anti-Jewish thing
                in any way. But I believe awareness of power structures must, because that’s what its all about.
            </p>

                Now that I’ve heard his voice, it isn’t what I imagined it to be. His trolling is valid, it’s good trolling and it’s for the right reasons in my opinion, but there’s something unstable there, unfortunately more like Valerie
                Solenas than Richard Stallman. There is absolutely no need to repeat an experiment in psychotropic drugs which failed entirely, and decimated the radical movements once, and can do so again.

            <p>I think you have an interesting point of view, I am curious about Yiddish, but I am not persuaded of any your direct points regarding Hitler and Naziism.</p>
            <p>
                You are making it out to be a natural thing, like it was just one crazy guy taking a little bit of German folklore and exploiting a history of anti-semitism like there was in France or Spain. That’s not what it was as I see
                it, this was not an opportunistic thing, it was the main goal of the program. Reaing Nietzsche is essential here.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think you fail to appreciate the uniqueness of the new kind of post-industrial secular anti-Christian Nietzschian anti-semitism. It’s something complete different from Christian anti-Semitism. Nietzsche SHUNS all previous
                anti-semitism, he thinks it is boorish and primitive and completely wrong, because it is an outgrowth of Christian thinking, which he despises.
            </p>
            <p>
                He substitutes for this something else, which is hatred of monotheistic ethics. Without monotheistic ethics, people, Nietzsche realized, would go right back to the order of Rome, with slavery, naked power, sexual
                exploitation, sadism, and general barbarism and a pure Darwinian political society, and he liked this idea, so he advocated it. He didn’t mind Jews who liked this idea too, by the way, he was happy with atheistic German Jews
                who advocated the same thing he was advocating. He just didn’t like what he considered to be the Jewish monotheistic ethics, even though these ethics are really Christian inventions if you look at them closely..
            </p>
            <p>
                The old pre-Nietzsche Christian anti-Semitism is the old tale of the blood-libel, it goes like this: Jews rejected and crucified Christ, then they rejected the redemption, and this rejection leaves them permanently vengeful
                and hateful, applying barbaric pre-Christian ideas of eye-for-eye and blood for blood, instead of the more modern (in the sense of the 2nd century AD) ideas of charity and forgiveness, and spiritual growth through meditation
                and so on. Think of Barrabas or Shylock from Marlowe’s plays. It is false, because the Jews had the same revolution in the religion as Christians did in 135 AD with the modern diaspora and the Jewish martyrs. In the end, the
                Jews converged on something which is essentially indistinguishable, metaphysics aside, from the Christians.
            </p>
            <p>
                The antagonism of Christianity and Judaism in the centuries preceding Nietzsche was simple religious conflict, like Jews vs. Samaritans in ancient times. The Christians put pressure on Jews to convert, they evicted them from
                place to place, but there was no concept of eradication or genocide, or any type of racial discrimination here, simply because this concept wouldn’t occur to a pre-Nietzsche anti-semite.
            </p>
            <p>
                The anti-semitism of Luther is of the old sort, the anti-semitism in Europe in general was of this old sort before the late 19th century. I believe Hitler was piggy-backing off of this anti-semitism to extend his appeal, but
                his anti-semitism is nothing like that. Hitler’s anti-semitism is Nietzche’s.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a direct attack on monotheism, it is really attacking Christianity not Judaism, by persecuting the Catholics, and deforming the Protestant churches to his will. The Bible was replaced with the Grimm tales in the
                schools in the period in question, on purpose to remove Jewish influence. Jewish works were burned, and Jewish contributions to thinking were denied, including religious thinking. Even Christmas was denuded of
                representations of Christ (this was controversial, but it happene in the later years of the era).
            </p>
            <p>
                Wherever possible, ethical questions that usually involve looking to God for guidance were removed using the Fuehrerprinzip, that you look only to Hitler to determine right or wrong. The Fuhrerprinzip was really an
                abdication of monotheistic ethics, and it was used to produce behaviors which could not be done since the modern religious era began in the 5th century.
            </p>
            <p>
                Borrowing from an equally secular and even more Rome-worshipping Mussolini, the Nazis made a restoration of Roman pomp and ceremony, and they restored one by one nearly all the things that the midieval era had gradually
                abolished. So you saw slavery state torture, and absolute power unchecked by any church.
            </p>
            <p>
                To this, they added totatlitarian surveillance, and the class rule of a Protestant bourgeoisie with unlimited power, and a complete disenfranchisment of Catholics whose religion was considered second only to Judaism in
                perniciousness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wagner was a traditional anti-semite, not a Nietzschian anti-semite, and Nietzsche did not like him because of this. But traditional anti-semitism was not antagonistic to the new kind of anti-semitism, Hitler, to the extent
                that he paid lip-service to Christianity, was both, But reliance on Christianity just blocked the attempts to extend this to a removal of Christianity from Germany. But the removal of Christianity was going on still. The
                goal was to produce a purely German national identity, free of sentimental ethics (ethics) and Jewish ethics (monotheism).
            </p>
            <p>
                The eventual goal was to wipe out Christianity as is clear from policy, from associations, and from Hitler’s writings. Nazi anti-semitism was first and foremost of the Nietzschian variety, and not any kind of traditional
                Christian catholic or Lutheran variety. It wanted to wipe out religion by wiping out what they saw as its source, then by gradually removing its manifestations.
            </p>
            <p>
                This type of anti-semitism produces genoicide, because the idea is that the Jews carry monotheism in their genes, and you can’t have them poisoning future generations. It also has no compunctions about genocide, because it
                has no sentimental ethics, your goal is to become hard as a rock, and to be able to murder without sentiment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mass conversion of Jews saved lives in previous Christian-Jewish conflicts, but it was useless here. The Nazis were simply murdering to erase people who they felt enslaved them with the monstrous lie of God, and they
                identified these people as the Jews.
            </p>

                Sort of, not exactly, it depends on the details. That’s what they say, that they are in danger, but they don’t make themselves seem powerless. Their caricatures of Jews are of a powerless sexless nebbish with a grating
                accent who sometimes get into a position of power through occult practices, and their caricatures of blacks are of borderline homeless hoodlums with no appeal. This is to deny actual power to those folks, which is something
                that, for them, involves masculine sexual authority and threat of violence.

            <p>“Trolling” as a term used to be applied for people who made insincere comments to get people emotionally riled up online. It was a form of “hah, made you look”.</p>
            <p>
                Now it is used for anyone who makes people feel bad, sincere or insincere, credible, or incredible. I did not “adopt” it as my mantle, it was shoved upon me at some point, as what I did started getting called “trolling”. In
                usenet times, this never happened, and my behavior hasn’t changed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The trolls, when they are sincere, are using methods of ridicule to reduce the authority of nincompoops who don’t deserve it, because these nincompoops are both wrong and saying nothing original. The modern-day version of
                trolls attack positions with over-the-top ridicule, because this is the only way to strip it of authority. This is the constructive thing people call “trolling” today, and this thing is absolutely essential for internet
                discourse to function. Without it, you get a mass of gullible know-nothings flooding every discussion with repetition of the well-trod known-to-everyone nothing-new-here majority view, in ten thousand slightly different
                phrasing.
            </p>
            <p>The troll gets them to shut up until they have something new and informative to say. Or, if they don’t, the troll makes them look ridiculous until they do. That’s the purpose of trolling, it is its function.</p>
            <p>
                Now there is something else called “trolling” which is just a sort of verbal prank, involving insincerely posting offensive material. This behavior is what “trolling” originally meant, but the term has drifted now, and I’m
                not going to accept conflating activity A with activity B.

                That’s not what’s going on here. What you get from him is “I AM racist, because I have this black judge denying my motions, and overruling my objections.” It’s weird, because despite the superficial flagrant assertion of
                racism, the actual content is not demeaning to anyone. It’s weird, there’s none of the usual racist attempt to diminish others using an implicitly accepted racial heirarchy to force them into a servile powerless position.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other similar things: “I have this good-for-nothing black acquaintance who beats me at chess and he always gets the girls.” or “I was trying to get this code to compile, and this black guy said ‘dude, you have an
                uninitialized pointer’ and he was totally pissing me off.” The power imbalance is pointing the wrong way for racism. It’s hard to do, because racism is really pervasive, and hard to avoid or mock, even if you are black. I
                don’t think Chris Rock managed it, his stuff strikes me as totally insensitive, because it aims the gun the wrong way. It’s next to impossible to aim the gun right.

                There is at least one such tradition, it’s called “academic peer review”. There is another such tradition which is anonymous pamphleteering, for example, Publius writing “The Federalist Papers”. So if by “never” you mean
                “always” then you are right.

            <p>I am NOT brave, I am a coward, but coward or not, one must speak out.</p>
            <p>
                Nobody takes anyone seriously with ad-hominem attacks, but they always come anyway, in support of whatever happens to be the powerful position. The insults are just designed to be over-the-top, to even out the insult
                environment and make all the cumulative effect of all the previous insults go away. This happens very fast, the insults become irrelevant once there are enough of them. At this point, people focus on the content, and only
                look at objective evidence. Without the stage being evenly muddy with roughly equal amounts of mutual insult, the arena for objective review is simply unavailable.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is unforunately required to have an even balance of insults on the page before people look at the facts objectively. When there is only one side posting insults, people believe that the insulting side must be strong, and
                don’t bother looking at the objective evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                So the first rule of propaganda is to insult the opposition, until all sides are covered with mud. When you are finished with the insults, then you present the objective evidence. The side with the objective evidence has
                nothing to worry about in a muddy environment.

                I don’t have any authority, and I don’t want it and I don’t need it. Authority is useless online, people make up their own minds regardless of your authority, by simply reading the debate and deciding. Authority is only
                useful in media where some people are shut out by decree, and the authority is let in through a social process. When everyone can participate, authority is actually a hindrance, because you can’t say certain things, at least
                not if you want to maintain your position of authority.
            </p>
            <p>
                The internet ethics are not exactly decided democratically, not if democracy means voting without information. These ethical questions are decided like all other ethical questions, by open debate and long discussions without
                censorship. I have no more authority than anyone else, I have LESS AUTHORITY, in fact NONE AT ALL, because I am posting insults to others.

                Hitler possibly believed in a sort of God, the same sort of historical-destiny God Nietzsche mentions sometimes, but this is certainly not the monotheistic God derived from the Christian tradition, which as far as I heard,
                Hitler considered incompatible with modern scientific understanding (it’s somewhere on Wikipedia, that’s the extent of my knowledge).
            </p>
            <p>
                He does not ever persuasively assert Christian beliefs as far as I can see, although as a politician he is required to do this, as you say. He certainly he doesn’t hold Catholic beliefs as an adult, as one of the principal
                tenets is the complete equality and unity of all races, at least anyone among them who accepts Catholicism. Hitler’s policy were ruthless toward the Catholic Slavs and toward the Orthodox Slavs (let alone the Marxist Slavs).
                His biggest financial support base was international Protestant capital, not Catholics, although his political base at home was in large part Catholic.
            </p>
            <p>
                He met with clergy, he struck deals with churches, but his movement’s eventual long-term goal was either the eradication of Christianity, or at least, it’s complete de-Judaization, and a Nietzschian-style restoration of
                pre-monotheistic ethics. I don’t consider Naziism a pure cult of personality either, so Hitler the person is not so important, as his ideas only get power through reinforcement from others around him. Among his political
                supporters and enablers, the great majority were rabidly anti-Marxist top industrialists and financiers, who were anti-Christian, or at least anti-Catholic, in large numbers. These people included a large number of Nietzsche
                followers, as they do to this day. So even if Hitler himself was a Christian, then he would have been a misled puppet figurehead for the Nietzschians behind him, a proposition which is extremely dubious.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hold to those beliefs described in the section of your link entitled “Hitler myths”. Hitler was not a sincere Christian, his regime was the closest the world came to reversing the Christian revolution of the 5th century
                AD, and Marxism too, I suppose. His Reich church would replace monotheistic ethics with a subserviance to a political order of the party, with all ethics contingent on the poitical decisions at the top. This is much as
                Communism in Russia had replaced the Orthodox church with subservience to the communist party.

                Ok, there’s a problem with this analysis, in that you don’t appreciate that the internet, with it’s rudeness, allows true scientific hypotheses to get a fair hearing, but only if those defending them are not shut up by
                censors. The censorship rules misidentify all criticism of authoritative comments as a form of “trolling”, or “unacceptable behavior”, because it always consists of a relative nobody telling a whole bunch of accepted experts
                “you don’t know what you are taking about”.

                This activity, when it is unrestricted by notions of politeness or civility, can produce a culture in which false beliefs are quickly eradicated. This is the culture of physics in the 20th century. Harrassment in real life
                is different from the debates of the internet, and the protections against harrassment, which are necessary, must take care to never make it acceptable to silence dissenting voices.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main problem in the internet today is not the harrassment, it is the encroaching censorship and civility. Without it, many ideas which today struggle woud be easily able to make breaktrhoughs, as only in a civil context
                is it appropriate to insult, say, an abiogenic petroleum expert, or a committed Marlovian scholar, as an ignorant yahoo without this person being able to write that the critic is the real yahoo.
            </p>
            <p>
                The freedom to criticize from those who lack authority to those that have authority always seems rude, an it must be protected at all costs online, as this is the only thing that makes the internet different from previous

            <p>
                I agree with you regarding harassment. My point is that this harassment, while over the line, is being used as a pretext to institute policy which has the effect of stifling rudeness, and stifling rudeness is something which
                simply cannot be tolerated, as rudeness is simply the only way to have a legitimate debate in a field which is politically closed to debate (and it helps with open fields too).
            </p>
            <p>
                Rudeness does alienate the “superior”, you will hardly ever persuade anyone by being rude, and you always, always, have a far better chance with a polite correction. But, counterintuitively enough, despite this being true, a
                polite correction online is nevertheless ALWAYS a mistake!
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason is that in an internet discussion, your goal is not to persuade the “superior”. On the internet, you don’t have a superior, you only have the debate. Nobody is superior except to the extent that they have a point
                to make, and can write it down effectively. So sure, you will alienate the superior nine times out of ten with the rudeness, but you have a much better chance of persuading the disinterested passerby that your case has
                merit, and then they are persuaded to do their own research, and then the truth emerges, one reader at a time. If you are wrong and rude, you will get corrected. If you are right and rude, the readers will persuade
                themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s the point of internet rude discussion. It hardly ever ends amicably between the participants, but the rudeness levels the authority playing field, it makes the contrasts stark and sharp, and bad or weak arguments are
                exposed quickly.
            </p>
            <p>In the absence of rudeness, the following will fly as an argument (real example):</p>
            <p>
                “You claim that nonabelian gauge theory configurations randomize at long distances on the lattice, but this is hopelessly out of date. This is belied by the simulations of

                “You are OUT OF YOUR MIND! There is NO CHANCE IN HELL that the lattice gauge theory doesn’t randomize on a large lattice, as I SIMULATED IT MYSELF, thousands of people simulated it themselves, and EVERYBODY HAS SEEN IT
                RANDOMIZE WITH THEIR OWN EYES since 1974!”
            </p>
            <p>What this does is eliminate any idea that a compromise position is possible, and it creates two stark choices, and only one may be supported, not both. When this happens, the reader is forced to choose.</p>
            <p>
                Such a reader will be put off by the harsh language, but in the end, after reviewing the papers, if they know anything technical, they will side with the critique, simply because it is factually correct. This is in fact what
                happened in this case, although I got called out for “trolling behavior” when I posted responses of this nature.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is simply the only credible way to maintain accuracy in a discussion which is open to the whole world. You can’t be polite to every idea, because when an idea is totally wrong, you need to harshly say so, and let the
                readers do their own peer review, until that idea dies a painful (quick) death. That’s it. There’s no alternative.
            </p>
            <p>
                You might say “what about using academic authority? Perhaps you could say— if what you were saying were true, it would be authoritatively accepted.” The problem with this is that the mentally retarded opinion he stated WAS
                AUTHORITATIVELY ACCEPTED in a journal, in a peer-reviewed publication, with some respectable number of citations. The academic authority system is not perfect, heck, it’s not even very good, and there are lots and lots of
                things that are totally wrong that would slide by in the old pre-internet days for years, decades, or centuries, with absolutely no correction, just based on their authority.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other alternative is polite debate which never ends and leaves everyone confused. I would also lose that debate, because my correction came with zero citations and zero academic credibility (as it usually does). But the
                lack of credibility or paper, or citations, does not change the property of long-distance gauge theory, I am still objectively right about this, and if I am right and if I am rude, I have nothing to fear, because then I will
                win.
            </p>
            <p>When I am wrong and I am rude, I will be rudely corrected, and then I learn something. Either way, everyone is better off when there is rudeness.</p>
            <p>
                The non-rude method doesn’t persuade the side that is wrong, because the side that is wrong is also surely the side which is intellectually dishonest and extremely stupid, or else they wouldn’t have made the mistake to begin
                with.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further, aside from experts, there are people who will NEVER CHECK the calculations, and will just trust the most respected author if there is no harsh critique (they will just be apprehensive of both sides when there is a
                critique, until consensus forms for which side is right). For their benefit, it is important to be 100% clear in your comment that you disagree vehemently, that you think that the thing is total crap, so that after people do
                the calculations or whatever and realize that you were right, they will know that the other side was COMPLETELY WRONG, nothing to salvage, no merit whatsoever.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a brutal form of intellectual discussion, and it is simply hard to tolerate in any community. It leads to quick progress in finding truth, and it is simply the default discussion behind the scenes in a physics
                department, or at least was throughout the 20th century. This is why physics was able to run circles around other fields in terms of progress, where we went from Maxwell’s equations in 1900 to knowing AdS/CFT in 1997. There
                is no comparable advance in the knowledge of humanity in any other field, there was more progress in those 97 years than in all of the previous history of humanity combined (and in my opinion, the great bulk of that progress
                post-dates 1960). and the rudeness was the central component which enabled it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am sorry, but the moment people talk about “trolling” and “restricting online behavior”, the first people to go under the cross-hairs are those who say things like what I said above. This is not a hypothetical, I have been
                kicked out of physics forums, off of Wikipedia, and off of Quora (for nonphysics things), because of the no-compromise rude and hostile responses. I will not back down on this, it is simply not acceptable to be polite, and
                any attack on trolling is an attack on impolite speech in disguise, and therefore a direct attack on academic honesty and academic progress on the internet full stop.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only reason that an appreciation for rudeness is not more common in all academic fields is because of the layers of authority preventing people from entering the literature. This means that the mechanism of entry is not
                through actual challenge of the intellectual position, but first through an apprenticeship, and then through a worthless posturing, a comparison of credentials. In an open discussion, there is no such thing, so there is
                nothing to stop people from posting nonsense. But there is also nothing stopping people from REBUTTING nonsense forcefully, and when nonsense is rebutted without hesitation as forcefully as possible, the discussion is better
                than any academic journal, by miles and miles, because not only the wrong ideas of those out of power are exposed, also the WRONG IDEAS OF EXPERTS are exposed and jetissoned.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no other reason for the internet’s existence in my opinion, other than bringing the gift of rudeness out of physics departments and spreading it to the masses. It is doing just that and people are trying to stop it,
                through linking this to far-fetched claims of violence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Threats and harrassment are already crimes, and there is no need to legislate new crimes for rude internet speech. Current law covers actual threats very well. The problem is that there is an attempt to make a consensus that
                politeness be the unofficial policy for internet discussion in both private and public hands, and politeness is simply a disease which cannot be tolerated.

                Ok, mental pain is sometimes good, as the act of learning to read involved a ton of mental pain, and I’m sure you approve. It’s sometimes bad, as for example, going through shell-shock. The stuff we are talking about is
                closer to “learning to read” than “shell shock”, and when it isn’t, it is already a crime.

                In rude forums, people come in with NO TRAINING AND NO EXPERTISE and occasionally have good ideas. There was a fellow at stackexchange who asked a nice question with an idea (I forgot what it was) which was totally original,
                totally correct, and completely wonderful.

                I have been arguing against a nearly unanimous position in this whole comment threat, nearly alone (the other people who agreed with me were all only, well, trolling!). Is it really hard to see the points everyone made and
                cut through the insults? Not at all because there are an equal number of insults, 100 people each giving 1 insult to me, and me giving 100 insults back, one to each of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                So in terms of insult/comment, I am the worst offender, but in terms of total number, it’s equal. Trolling neutralizes the authority, and then you can make up your own mind without the bias of feeling like you’re in the
                minority.
            </p>
            <p>It’s a psychological trick— it’s 1 person’s insults vs. 100 people’s insults, you’re still in the minority really, but the psychological effect is real, the two positions are battling in a position on equality.</p>
            <p>
                Then people go home and think about it, and the right position wins. I’ll give you a clue, the right position is my position, and the evidence that it is right is the very discussion which establishes it, i.e. this comment
                thread.

                I read more about this, I strongly dispute the content of that page. It isn’t compatible with readings of Hitler, and it is simply trying to protect Nietzschian philosophy from the stain of association with Hitler, and
                shoving Hitler on the cross instead. He is not an actual Christian, at least not in any historically accurate meaning of the term, and he is not a pure Nietzschian either. He is Hitler, he’s his own thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The “historical destiny” God can be a personal God too, it’s not necessarily impersonal, and I didn’t mean to imply that it was. Hitler did believe he was on the side of historical destiny God. It just wasn’t the normal
                Catholic God of his youth, at least not as interpreted normally. He was sure that Jesus was an Aryan, he drew a blonde Jesus as an artist. He believed that God was on the side of racial supremacy, and culling of those he
                percieved as weak, by means of state power. He supported homicidal eugenics, something the church has always consistently opposed with no exception (and opposed in Nazi Germany too, when they were gassing the mentally
                handicapped, which is why the holocaust was kept more or less a secret), and his positions reflect a populist German brand of Nietzschianism, because although he wasn’t a Nietzsche reader, the ideas of Nietzsche had
                thoroughly seeped in throughout Germany. The main idea of Nietzsche is that monotheism strangles the strong with the ethics of slaves, and that Jews imposed Christianity on others, so as to weaken the others. Nietzsche
                himself hated traditional Christian anti-Semitism, because he hated Christianity. Hitler just wasn’t clever enough to hate Christianity, or else he was just clever enough to hide his hatred of Christianity. He just
                publically hated the Jews, something which both Nietzchians and Christian anti-Semites could both agree on.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can read his words in Mein Kampf (I read it a long time ago, by skimming, it’s online). He is opposed to the doctrines of weakness— he opposes the notion that “the meek shall inherit the Earth”, he considers the notion
                of submission and passive resistance as abhorrent, he believes in ruthless power, and says so explicitly.
            </p>
            <p>Bormann was the true Nietzschian, it is true, not so much Hitler, who was not. But the rank-and-file SS was Nietzschian, not weird perverted Christian. The head honcho was more superficially Christian than the rest.</p>
            <p>
                The complicity of the Catholic church with Hitler is well known, and this stains Pope Pius forever. But in contrast, individual Catholics and pious Protestants formed the greatest core of resistance to Hitler throughout the
                regime.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fact is that Hitler was trying to reform Christianity as a religion of strength, with an Aryan jesus, a doctrine of merciless cruelty, and an ethics of absolute subservience to state authority. These are simply not
                compatible with Christianity in any form, although because the Church didn’t like Jews for religious reasons, it did not object to the murder of Jews unless they had become Catholic.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Jews that converted to Catholicism were butchered just the same as all the rest. Conversion didn’t help, because Nietzsche style anti-semitism is not against the Jews because they are Jewish, it is against the Jews
                because it imagines that they are the ones who produced monotheistic Christianity, and it is against monotheism. Hitler, like all good politicians, was all things to all people, and both Nietzschians and Christian
                anti-Semites could find something to support.
            </p>
            <p>The way to resolve such disputes is to read the actual sources, and see who had the power in the regime. Was it the Christian Catholic anti-Semites? Or was it the secular Nietzschians?</p>
            <p>Unlike Hitler, Mussolini is openly Nietzschian.</p>
            <p>Neitzche wasn’t the official philosopher of the Nazis for no reason, even though he wasn’t Hitler’s favorite. As I said, Naziism wasn’t a pure cult of personality, Hitler was just the top man.</p>

                Criminality had nothing to do with German persecution of Jews, as there was no exceptional criminality statistics among Jews in Germany, and the Jews were assimilated. The real motivation is to remove monotheism and restore
                the pre-Christian ideals of the strong dominating the weak ruthlessly, as this is what Nietzsche advocated.

                I read more about Yiddish. The main problem here is the Khazar hypothesis is still ridiculed, when recent genetics and good history make it clear that it is likely the correct origin of at least a large part if not the
                majority, of Ashkenazi Jews. Once the Khazar hypothesis is accepted, the story of French migration becomes patently ridiculous, and the origin of German Jews is clearly from the East. This favors the Eastern theories of
                Yiddish origin, but not with certainty. The academic discourse is being polluted because the main point— Khazar origin— is suppressed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t know why it is suppressed, really. A lot of Ashkenazi Jews told me that Sephardi Jews were considered “more authentic” in the Ashkenazi community, with better ties to historical Biblical Judaism. The Khazar origin of
                Ashkenazi Jews should not be threatening to Jews at all. What’s wrong with being Khazar? People are people. Central Asia is a nice place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, once the Khazar thing is respectable among normal people, instead of just Neo-Nazis (a certain percentage of neo-Nazis support this hypothesis also), then you can determine the linguistic origins of Yiddish in an
                objective way which doesn’t involve infighting between bigoted academics. I don’t know enough to say which of these folks is right, but the historical guy, the one who said it comes from France, is definitely wrong, because
                Ashkenazis didn’t come from France, they came from the East for sure.

                There is nothing to concede. It took me forever to realize that you are likely the same person as the author of the article, because you disguised it. So I took “Raven’s opinion” and “Karen’s opinion” to be two separate

                They did not use criminality to justify their policy, it simply was not a justification in their propaganda. It doesn’t appear anywhere as there was no fear of Jewish gangs. Their propaganda image of Jews is of a scheming
                sexless physical weakling, not a street thug. I’ve haven’t seen a reference to what we normally call criminality in the propaganda, although I only read a little of der-Sturmer, so if you know examples, please tell me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jews in 20th century Germany were assimilated, they didn’t live in isolated Ghettos, they spoke German fluently, they worked in the professions, and they were completely integrated in day-to-day life and were not on the
                whole extraordinarily socioeconomically disadvantaged, although they were underrepresented in the high German bourgoisie. This assimilation and normality is why the genocide came as such a brutal shock, because it was a
                demonstration for many that assimilation of Jews in Europe is simply impossible, and even if theoretically possible, too risky to continue.
            </p>
            <p>
                The propaganda made Jews out to be vermin, and the “crimes” were not street crimes, like mugging, but crimes against Germany. There were other crimes too, like absurd slurs about Jewish incestuous behavior, ideas of corrupt
                morals (meaning having sex with Germans), and ideas of spreading degenerate art (meaning Picasso and Jazzz). Perhaps regarding the Picasso and Jazz business, some Jews have to plead “guity”, and I’m sure that some people had
                sex every once in a while outside of ethnic boundaries. But the decadent morality assertions, the incest, the cheating, was simply an old anti-semitic trope used to prop up the new anti-semitism.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main crime here was God, imposing a religion of weakness on the strong. There was also the imagined crimes: the “stab in the back” of 1918 causing Germany to lose the war (a similar stab-in-the-back motif appears in
                American films regarding the Vietnam war, except this time blaming Hippies, not Jews) of inspiring Britain to declare war on Germany, and the other imagined crime of having set up the Soviet Union (although here, there were
                disproportionately many Jews in the politburo in 1917, this was all over by 1930, as Stalin purged all of them, and in Soviet Communism in the early era, being Jewish or Chinese, or whatever, didn’t make any difference. It
                still usually doesn’t, although it did under Stalin).

                Yes, the proportion of those people has fallen to a point where their presence has negligible political impact. I know it doesn’t feel that way when they are so threatening and hateful to blacks in America, and one must
                always be vigilant, but the Confederate symbol was removed from the flag in Virginia and there are no more obstacles to Martin Luther King Day. The South is shedding its neolithic confederate heritage, and the atrocious
                blind defense of that wretched heritage in media which used to appear everywhere from “Birth of a Nation” to “Dukes of Hazzard” is now completely erased. You don’t find any positive representations of confederacy or the
                confederates anymore, and they are always a political liability. They aren’t all dead yet, but under these political circumstances, it won’t be long. They certainly are nothing to worry about today, although one must always
                keep vigilant, you are right, in case they ever start to get positive mention again.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reenactments are not sympathetic to the confederacy in general, although they used to have this flavor. Now they are more a way of keeping history alive. I don’t think you can ignore the change in the South in the last
                30 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, these neanderthal Confederates are not the source of Republican appeal, or there would be zero membership in the Black Republican Caucus. The appeal is class inequality, and the doctrine of the superior person,
                independent of race or gender, just by virtue of the “Will to Power” that you need to rise up the ranks in politics.

                I am not talking about Jesus or even Paul, I am talking about the basic point of Christian church teachings as understood essentially from the beginning until now. These teachings were designed to create martyr actions which
                would topple Roman naked absolute power, and place the church as an ethical guide above the power of the state. It’s sort of like the communist party placing itself above the state in Russia, this is mideval theocracy,
                except not totalitarian, in that individual political leaders only looked to the church when they did something objectionable, and the Church ensured they lost support.
            </p>
            <p>
                The doctrines are of complete equality of all humans who accept Christ, of all Church members, of a non-specific non-tribal deity you are supposed to export to everyone in the world, of denying worldly power, and of
                spiritual resistance to barbaric cruelty by examples of martyrdom. These are the fundamental tenets.
            </p>
            <p>
                To say Hitler said “Christ” is meaningless if the fundamental tenets aren’t there. The fudnamental tenets in Hitler are replaced by Nietzschian ones, of strength, and Christ becomes the “god of whites”, instead of a
                monotheistic “God for all humanity”. That’s a subversion of all previous Christian teachings, there can be no debate over this. There was not a ton of debate about this in Hitler-times either, the sincerely religious people
                didn’t feel he was one of them, and the White Rose consisted of some Christians in Germany, however few of them were left.

                ). I’m sorry to link, but if you are an atheist, then you usually just don’t understand what monotheism means. Nietzsche was an atheist who actually understood what monotheism means, and rejected it, and the Nazis followed

                I read EXACTLY THAT STUFF in der-Sturmer. Oh I see. I said “They didn’t use criminality in their propaganda”, I meant by that “They didn’t use criminality in their sincere propaganda, the stuff I said— stab in the back,
                Jewish weakening of German morals with weakness, Nietzsche, that’s what they used to get sincere people to join the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                That stuff in Sturmer is not what you normally call criminality. It’s fantasy crime, and the association with Jews was fantasy writing. The propaganda was real, but it was just like “The Weekly World News”, it wasn’t about
                real-world events. There were no jewish ritual murders, there were no jewish white slavers (nowadays it’s called “human trafficking”), it was all fantasy for the readers, like the Weekly World News in the US, which served a
                similar role at attacking the public’s brains, minus the genocide.
            </p>
            <p>Your quote “But the Nazis used the theory of “collective guilt” to try to round up and execute ALL Jews for the “criminality” of which only a few were actual examples”.</p>
            <p>
                This is a problematic quote. That’s not what was going on at all. They did not round up and execute Jews for criminality in any way shape or form, this is for sure incorrect, I know, because I know how propaganda is made.
                That stuff was nonsense which slowly, slowly, gets the public at large on board with the genocide, and it had zero influence on Nazi policy, which wasn’t decided by polling the public, but from the top down.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Nazis were NOT sincerely blaming the Jews for any actual crimes, Sturmer wrote over-the-top stuff like this “Jews EAT JonBenet Ramsey, use blood for Matzos”, to get the public to hate the Jews through this reasoning:
                “Well, they didn’t eat JonBenet Ramsey, but they sure are wicked anyway, and I’m sure they had SOMETHING to do with the dissapearance”, etc. This is the propagandist method, it has nothing to do with any actual Jewish
                criminals, none of which I ever saw in derSturmer. It simply wasn’t about ordinary crime, like a crime novel is about crime.

                I think Streicher should not have been executed, he should have been imprisoned instead of the rank and file SS (and the rank and file SS executed). He was the Rush Limbaugh to the Nazi’s Dick Cheney, he had no influence,
                and he had nothing to do with policy. He was also a boor, and the Nazis had nothing to do with him, he wasn’t a high-class guy like they were. He was just a guy they hired to slowly chip away at the public’s opinion of Jews
                and communists, by creating such extreme hatred, that more mild but still extreme hatred became the compromise position, and the norm. Because people usually make their opinion by weighted average of everything they hear,
                and it requires serious counterpropaganda to undue this natural tendency.
            </p>
            <p>That counterpropaganda is what I am doing here. I am simply removing all the Streicher-isms by adding Streicher-isms going in the other direction to neutralize them.</p>
            <p>
                The only way Streicher style hatred becomes a social disease is if it only comes from one direction without neutralizing counter-propganda. In the 1940s, the communist partisans produced high quality counter-propaganda
                against the Germans, and unlike the Germans, they didn’t focus on imaginary sensationalist crimes, but on very real ones.

                There is no dispute among Christians regarding the meaning of this verse (nor can the meaning possibly be disputed by any person who is able to read and reads the chapter). There is not a SINGLE Christian denominational
                interpretation of this verse as militaristic, it is only thought of this way in ignorant people who are skimming the New Testament, and are snarkily looking for a contradiction or alternative reading which in this case does
                not exist. Jesus never advocates military struggle or violence in any form, and none of the Christian texts are about violent struggle (although they are about a struggle).
            </p>
            <p>
                The actions of Jesus in overturning the money changer tables are symbolic of nonviolent protest. There is no real implied violence towards any human being, still it is not a passive action. The point is that Jesus is not an
                authority of any kind, and has no power to get the money changers out, nor is he a man who has any ability to harm them, except symbolically.

                etc, etc, really pissy annoying answers, classic trolling. The whole of the gospels are a blueprint for effective trolling, and this is why I was inspired to read the whole thing, and why it was moving. It is clearly a
                description for how to challenge power effectively, with martyrdom accepted as the price.

                preserved. It’s how you produce progress.

                Hitler is about thuggery, and the resuscitation of the Roman empire, and natural law of strong oppressing weak. This is the opposite of the CORE TENET that makes Christianity Christianity, (ignoring metaphysics, since
                religious metaphysics is always purposefully stupid and nonsensical). The Roman natural law order is opposed permanently and consistently, at all times, by all denominations, without exception, except perhaps Mormonism which
                I am not familiar with. These things are simply not fungible, if it doesn’t oppose the Roman style order of natural law and hierarchies of humanity, it just shouldn’t be called Christianity.

                Look, there was opposition to the theory of relativity in 1920, and it involved powerful people. They kicked out Einstein and instituted German physics. Then in the 1940s they went underground. By 1960s, there was no
                opposition to relativity except for cranks. The Confederacy is dying, let it die, there will always be cranks.

                It’s science, other people’s opinion are simply not important. Only the instrument readings and calculations are important in evaluating a proposition, and for most of my original stuff, so far so good. It is really useful
                to know that there is someone who finds it unconvincing, because if there weren’t it couldn’t possibly be new or interesting. The evaluation of a new scientific proposition is by testing it as objectively as possible, not by
                listening to the mentally defective people in positions of authority.

                I am sorry, you simply have not read the gospels at all. There is no way in heck that any of that stuff can be read as a preparation for a military revolt. The whole point of the crucifiction is that Jesus was NOT engaged in
                any military anything, he was completely innocent, he didn’t do anything except troll the empire.

                The Jewish revolt of 66 AD was JEWISH not Christian, the Christians weren’t in Palestine at the time as far as I can tell from any reliable historical record, they were all in Rome. This revolt had nothing to do with Jesus,
                it had to do with the Jewish interpretation of messiah at the time, which was the leader who would overthrow Rome by force of arms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jesus, as far as I can see, is more a vague amalgalm of various people than a person. He’s a prototype for martyrdom and resistance. There’s much of James the Just in Jesus, a little of John the Baptist, those are definitely
                historical people, and maybe there was another person named Jesus too, although that is not strictly necessary for the religion to work. You are trying to read in a historical Jesus into the documents, something that
                contravenes the purpose of the text, which is to replace the miltaristic doctrines of messiah with spiritual doctrine of messiah. The text is a REACTION to Jewish militaristic interpretation of messianic doctrine, it is
                saying that messiah is a spiritual term, not a military term, and the victory does not come on a literal field of battle. This is the WHOLE POINT of the texts, and it is not only accepted by Christians, it is also accepted
                by Jews past 135 AD, when Rabbi Akiva and all the others are martyred.
            </p>
            <p>
                This new interpretation withstood history. Ben Gurion, who actually “liberated Palestine for the Jews” is not identified as a “messiah” in any Jewish religious text (although some secular Jews proposed that he should be so
                identified), simply because he is a secular political leader, not a spiritual figure. The interpretation of the term changed, and the Christians led the change. The change is there from the beginning, and any militaristic
                sentiment you read into the gospels is your own insistence on falsely reading made up history into (reasonably good) theology.
            </p>
            <p>The Jesus followers were nothing like the Manson followers, as they were all Greek, and mostly outside of Palestine, and they did not support militaristic resistance to Roman rule.</p>
            <p>
                I strongly disagree with your painting of the events in the gospels as preparations for military revolution. This is just what non-Christians or atheists do when reading the text without understanding. The texts were written
                in the 2nd century, and are not celebrating the end of a failed revolt, but the beginning of a successful one.

                You don’t have to explain propaganda, I know what it looks like. The disagreement I had here was with the idea that controlling crime was a motivation for the genocide. It simply wasn’t. The motivation for the genocide was
                the “Stab in the back”, the idea of “Jews control US and British media”, “They hate Germans”, and, most importantly, the new idea that “Jews must be removed so that the German can be strong again without the polluting
                influence of monotheism”. That’s the motivations for genocide, and of these, all but the last are too weak to explain how it turned into genocide.

                It had most to do with Einstein being right about relativity. It’s more interesting when it goes in the other direction, where the side that is crushed militarily and politically is the one that is right. For example, with
                regard to Gentzen, who was a German starved to death after the war, and who had the right position regarding the Hilbert program. Hilbert died (of old age) during the war. In this case, Godel fled to the US, and Godel’s
                position that there can be no good consistency proof of arithmetic was dogma in mathematics until today. But with a little bit of explanation, you can counteract this political disease and show that Gentzen’s position is
                right. Gentzen’s position was also close to Turing’s, but Turing postwar is outed as a homosexual and driven to suicide (or perhaps dies accidentally, maybe he was even murdered, although that looks unlikely), and also
                Alonzo Church, but he dies too. So there was no strong counter-push to Godel politically. So what happened? Did Gentzen get suppressed forever? No. There are mathematicians who advocate his program of ordinal analysis today,
                including Rathjen at Leeds, and I try to do propaganda to get this injustice reversed. Staying in Hitler’s Germany does not mean you don’t know math. A similar example is Teichmuller’s work on his eponymous spaces, which was
                underground for decades, although I believe he was an actual Nazi.

                Neo-Confederacy is a political movement, and politics is not so different from how science proceeds. There is a truth here too, but a more vague ethical truth, and the processes of history reveal it also, and it is
                irreversible ratchet. That’s the “historical God”, and it’s a part of monotheism too, that’s probably the most distinctively Jewish part, and it’s not a false proposition.

                That’s them trying to exploit racists for political ends, like the Democrats try to exploit drug use for political ends, it’s not them accepting racism as a principle. The Republican party tried to appeal to racists in that
                period, but that really was never that strong an appeal, and it ended with Bush I and Bush II, they were not racist at all, and both have serious non-token African American appointees (Bush I had Colin Powell, Bush II had a
                whole bunch). Further Bush I understood the principle of civil rights well enough to push through a serious expansion of the notion of what civil-rights bill can do, extending the concept to actually disabled people. this
                was the American With Disabilities Act, which has been a model for the rest of the world.

                I don’t like to dispute these, as I don’t support these folks, and I despise Bush II more than any other president, but I really think these are arguable, even though Willie Horton has become a staple example of
                race-baiting. The content of the ad is Duakakis supporting prison furloughs in Massachussettes, and really it would have worked equally well against Dukakis if Willie Horton had been white and otherwise all the same. I agree
                that the imagery in the ad was pure race-baiting, that the wording and imagery was playing to racist fears directly, and it was reprehensible. But dude. Prison Furloughs? For lifers? That’s a really stupid idea, and it looks
                like a legitimate attack, if it were done without the racial aspect (just removing Horton’s photo would have been sufficient).
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t believe that the racial undertone had anything to do with Bush I as a president, and I am not sure if he was competent to understand the significance of this stuff beyond the surface level of the ad. He wasn’t so
                subtle. The surface level is fine, it’s an attack on a stupid policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway It is obvious from his appointments and supported legislation that as a leader his racial stance was not out of line with the mainstream today. It’s a terrible ad, but the race baiting aspects are overemphasized in my
                opinion. A more legitimate example of race-baiting I think is Reagan’s welfare queen in a cadillac, or starting his campaign in a confederate stronghold. Reagan did race-baiting more than the Bush’s, and I don’t think it’s a
                coincidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                The black disenfranchisement in the election of Bush II was racially discriminatory, but in my opinion it was not particularly racist (I know it sounds like a contradiction in terms), not like housing discrimination, or
                education funding discrimination, or segregated schooling is racist. This was a pure deiberate disenfranchisement of most likely Democratic voters, like ballot stuffing in 1964 for Kennedy, and it did not have the same
                racial impact as race discrimination per-se. It was opportunism. I do not consider it a racial attack, but a (highly illegal) political attack using voting statistics to identify populations whose disenfranchisement would
                impact the opposing party. The neglect of the population after Katrina I do not think is about race at all, rather about class, the rich people in New Orleans wanted the poorer folks removed, regardless of race. The wealthy
                folks in the higher area neighborhoods New Orleans were diverse too, they weren’t all white. I don’t support any of this nonsense, but it is simply not true that either Bush was a racist, it simply doesn’t pass the smell
                test.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for the links between Bush and the Neo-Confederates, it is true but it is as understandable as the link between Obama and Bill Ayers, or marijuana clubs. You don’t control everyone you support, and you sometimes support
                those who help you without supporting their position. Also, Bill Clinton’s “Sister Souljah” speech was race baiting in a worse way than any of the Bush material, but he was not criticized for it, because it was clearly
                political opportunism, and his policies were good for racial harmony.

                Ha Ha, yes, Disqus doesn’t understand the subtlety of “rooster”. Sorry for “you didn’t read the gospels”, I see you did, and I appreciate the independent interpretation. But I think you were looking at it the wrong way,
                looking to extract a historical interpretation out of it by interpreting the events causally, and I think this is largely a mistake, because there is no independent solid description of any historical events that led up to
                this, and they are not necessary. I take it as a snapshot of the spiritual doctrines of the time when they were written, not as any kind of accurate description of any historical events that led to this doctrine, which are
                lost to history.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t consider the gospels as a reliable historical record, any more than I consider, say, exodus as a reliable historical record. When you try to figure out what could possibly be the historical events behind the text,
                you are doing something other than reading the text and extracting the spiritual guidance that it is giving, and you tend to focus on incidental passages, like “sell your cloak and buy a sword”, rather than the main message
                in the text.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Peter treif-picnic may post-date the crucifiction, but is pre-dates the writing of the gospels, so all that it tells you is that acceptance of Jesus is not dependent on accepting Mosaic dietary law, which just lowers the
                barrier for the religion to spread.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am projecting this “back” to Jesus, because the texts were written after all the events were already complete, so they are made self-consistent teleologically by the chroniclers. I don’t consider them to be historical
                record in any form sufficiently unaltered to divine what actually went on in the sense of historical fact, so I read them as a unified spiritual whole, with backward and forward influence, like Exodus back-influences
                Genesis.

                That’s a very violent interpretation of Christianity, and it does not describe other post Constantine events very well. For example, the Colloseum was closed when a martyr stood up in protest, and was killed by the mob,
                leading the authorities to shut down the place. Christians brought the religion to Germany, to England, and to Ireland, then to Poland, and Russia, and so forth, and these people were powerless in the new lands, and were
                persecuted like the Church founders were. This is not the kind of action you expect from a vengeful Christian victory, it wasn’t a military action or an action of the sword, rather the same kind of actions which are
                consistent with previous martyrs, following the letter of the gospels.
            </p>
            <p>
                The deaths of the Mithraic priests are historical, but I don’t know what happened there. When you say “Christians did it”, it is not clear that it is the Church itself meting out a death sentence, or whether it is a lot of
                former slaves doing terrible things to their former masters, as often happens in any successful slave revolt. Same with Hypatia. These pagans were likely slave-owners, and Christianity was a successful slave-revolt, where
                the slaves become free. the scholarly stuff was destroyed by those who were destroying the slave system, same as the classical art and classical culture.
            </p>
            <p>
                I see it from a different perspective, which is more Marxist (but Nietzsche also saw it this way, he just didn’t like it). The revolt here is the elimination of the Roman slave-master system, with the creation of a sort of
                egalitarian brotherhood of slaves, which is then reinforced by religious terror from a political organization, sort of like modern Marxist states. The terror was towards those who supported the old order, and the terror was
                ruthless toward the masters in a similar way to how slavery was ruthless toward the slaves. It’s like the terror in Russia, or in other communist states, which was directed at those who in other societies would be members of
                the bourgeoisie. Their plight is more visible, as they are visible members of society, while the plight of slaves was about as worthy to record as the plight of homeless vagabonds is today.
            </p>
            <p>
                The collapse of the slave system just destroyed the old economic order of Rome, so that the enormous construction projects could not be done, the precision sculpture could not be made (which incidentally suggests to me that
                the precision sculpting was done as grunt-work by slaves from body-casts, not by an undocumented army of ancient Rodins from their imagination), the libraries could not be maintained outside of Churches, and the old
                doctrines of master superiority over slave were removed, and anyone who supported these doctrines was a target. The whole system collapsed, and the dark ages means that even high-class literacy was gone, leaving only Church
                literacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t see this as the Christians now doing the same thing when in power, because these power structures just absolutely needed to be removed, otherwise we would still be living in a Roman style essentially Nazi slave
                state.
            </p>
            <p>
                The real terror here during the midieval era was the suppression of individual initiative, much like in modern Marxist states. Anyone who wanted to do an individualist project, like Marlowe writing great plays, is considered
                as an atavistic throwback to the Roman masters, and shunned by the community, and is only accepted back if they accept the authority of the community and the communal values that are shared since the Christian revolution.

                The Protestant revolution allowed a certain amount of individuality in Christianity, modern science restored not even Roman science (which was atrocious) but previous Greek science and extended it tremendously— the
                suppression of honest science was in my opinion the greatest problem with the church, and Capitalism allowed the division of labor found in master/slave societies to be reestablished within a more egalitarian system, but
                still not very egalitarian. But this partial classical restoration in the 1492-1992 bourgeoise era also lead people to consider Christianity as an imposition of slave-order on the powerful, and there are people who always
                want to be able to own others and impose their will through force and violence, something against which Christianity puts a good barrier.

                I get your point, and it is interesting, but I can’t agree that it was falsified, the pacifism is a major doctrine, and the relative peacefulness of the Christian revolution, as compared to say, the Spartacus revolt, or the
                Jewish wars, attests that it was not a false front. The vestigial remnants of militarism in the gospels can be considered a hidden coding of some lost original militaristic teaching, but I think it is a mistake and a
                disservice to the text. I think any military references are always better thought of as an explicit metaphor for the coming spiritual battle. Even the “sell your cloak and buy a sword”, and it is not to be interpreted
                literally, but in the same way all Christians have standardly interpreted it.

                Relative peacefulness is exactly what it was. The transition was Constantine accepting Christianity by a slow conversion process in discussions with one of his family members who was Christian, and then some time later
                another emperor making the religion the official state religion. That’s what happened, it wasn’t a violent revolution in any sense.
            </p>
            <p>
                The persecution of pagans was a component too, after the Christians were dominant, but, really, the pagans had propped up the slave system of Rome for centuries, I hate to say it, but they really had it coming, and
                persecuting them is no more unusual than people persecuting Nazis today (although we are more civilized about it). The pagan system in Rome justified slavery, murder of slaves in arenas, horrors you can’t imagine.
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn’t conquest, it was social pressure to convert, and directed localized killings at best to remove Pagan strongholds that resisted Christianization. It wasn’t a bloodbath like Masada or the conquest of Jerusalem circa
                66AD, and although I don’t support this kind of thing, it was better than what was going on before.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think you are trying to read in violence into one of the most peaceful revolutions in history. You can see the same thing again in the conversion of the Germans, in the conversion of the British, the Irish, and so on,
                there are a dozen or more examples of Christianizing revolutions. Each of these followed the same pattern, proselyzing, conversion, slowly working up the power structure until the leaders capitulate, and then cleaning up the
                residual paganism by social coercion and a small number of executions at best. That’s the standard pattern, and I don’t believe it was any different in the Roman Empire.

                It is not true that each denomination recognizes a different interpretation of these gospel quotes. They all interpret it as a struggle for dominance, without bloodshed, by conversion. Besides, Christianity was under unified
                leadership at that time, it hadn’t split into denominations yet. That’s the standard interpretation, and it is universal as far as I know, certainly today, and I don’t see evidence that it wasn’t universal in the past. Your
                examples are just not persuasive.

                Sorry, you are just missing the whole point of the Christian revolution here. Christianity discouraged Christians from holding Christian slaves, all Christians were brothers and sisters in the church, and a socially enforced
                loose condition for joining was emancipating the Christian slaves you owned, on your own schedule, but it was a process that was definitely going on, because widespread slavery is replaced by a different economic order in
                this era.
            </p>
            <p>
                You freaked me out, so I just looked it up, and it’s in the same exact Pauline epistle, the Epistle to Philemon. You should read it properly. Philemon is the Christian slaveowner, Onesimus is the fugitive slave. Paul has to
                decide what to do regarding Onesimus. Onesimus is returned to his master, Paul obeys secular law regarding slavery, but at the same time Paul exhorts Philemon to treat the slave not as a slave, but as a brother in Christ,
                and insists that they are social equals (I read this on Wikipedia just now, but it is what I remember from the New Testament). Then the master frees the slave, and they are both canonized.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s not like the Church handed out Sainthood for no reason, this is what the main teaching on slavery was, as I understood— the masters will eventually join the Church through social pressure, as the empire is
                Christianized, slaves join the church automatically, they come first. Once the master and slave both join, they are social equals in the Church, and the expectation is for the masters to gradually emancipate their slaves,
                without coercion, or legal obligation, just as a sign of sincere Christianity.
            </p>
            <p>
                I should point out that this is exactly analogous to the Jewish religious emancipation, where Jews are required to free Jewish slaves after 7 years of bondage. Except, being Christian, it doesn’t go by a strict timetable,
                and it’s more of a wink-wink nudge-nudge social compact than a rigid law (as is the spirit of the religion— the expectations for behavior in Christianity are enforced by shaming and collective will, rather than by written
                law).
            </p>
            <p>
                This kind of excruciatingly slow emancipation is in conflict with the desire of abolitionists, so the texts are ambiguous on the subject, in the sense that revolt is discouraged, but at the same time emancipation is
                encouraged. The exhortation to obey your masters I read as an exhortation to not make revolution, but to wait for the process to complete of its own accord, as it did, over 500 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                The effect of this teaching is that as Christianization proceeded, the slaves would be freed gradually, and the slave system was replaced by serfdom and artisan labor, with political heirarchies of land-owning and
                serf-control through nobility grants from the local secular authority. The Church’s role was overruling secular policy it felt was not consistent with Christianity, so like a presidential veto plus a supreme court. This is
                the Feudal system, and it is a different economic order than the Roman slave system, where slavery was basically total and unlimited.
            </p>
            <p>
                You were completely inverting my own memories of reading the New Testament and related historical materials, but I read only enough to form this basic picture, as this transition I was not so interested in. I was genuinely
                mystified at how you could come to this interpretation of the Christian slavery teaching, but I think I understand now. You are reading it based on the completely wacko interpretations of these teachings in the American
                slave era. I do not believe I am the one deluding myself here. Christianization was a real slave revolt, and the most successful one in history.
            </p>
            <p>
                This doctrine was flexible and did not enforce things by decree and certainly not by direct armed revolt, but the slave system was replaced by a serf system in this time through Church action, and this is gradual and clear
                because you can see large slaveholding construction projects stop dead, and the whole slave economy collapses. Where did all the large slaveholders go during the dark ages? What happened to the slaveholding dynasties? They
                were all gone by the 7th century as every slave was freed or died.
            </p>
            <p>
                The slavery teachings are simply not encouraging a slave revolt, rather emancipation through gradual Christanization of the whole empire. If I am wrong about this, please let me know, because otherwise I can’t understand the
                massive social upheaval that accompanied the Christianization of Rome at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern slavery, the 18th and 19th century kind, was historically disconnected from the slavery of Rome. It began with slavery of Muslims and other non-Christians in the late midieval era, and continued with slavery in
                colonial regions. As I understood the events, there are two completely distinct slave-phases, the Roman one, where the majority are slaves and they are largely of the same ethnicity as the masters, and the modern slavery
                where a minority are slaves in remote regions, and this minority is foreign and of a different ethnicity. As I understand, the two phases are not connected by any direct historical line of slave-owning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, the readings of these doctrines and texts were perverted and inverted in the American slave era, as I understand it, to understand these gradual abolitionist sentiments, which freed the ancient slaves over geological
                time, to instead imply that slavery is just and proper. The readings are not consistent with the interpretation of the texts in their Roman context, and really, the feeling of Northerners that Christianity and slavery are
                just incompatible was wholly correct.

                These are ridiculous Confederate Southern misinterpretations of the purpose of Pauline teachings. Do you really think that those Southerners understood the purpose and principles of Christianity? Don’t you think they were
                reading in their self-interest?
            </p>
            <p>
                The type of chattel slavery these southerners condoned was the kind historically removed by Christianity. It is contrary to the traditional understanding of these verses to read them as condoning slavery, although that was a
                common Protestant misreading in the colonial era, for obvious reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paul returning Onesimus to Philemon is NOT an example of Paul condoning slavery— it is an example of how Christianity deals with master/slave conflict and the justness of freedom for the slave. The slave and master are first
                to be reconciled, they become brothers in the Church, and then with enough time, the master sets the slave free because it is the right thing to do (or usually more accurately, as a result of a significant social shaming
                process if he doesn’t).

                Sorry, you have no idea what you are talking about, and you are repeating Confederate stupidity regarding Christian history. I reviewed the material yesterday, the review did very little, it just shifted the dates of
                emancipation around— I thought slavery was totally eliminated in the 6th century, and it was actually eliminated in the 7th.
            </p>
            <p>
                The major role of Christianity, and the largest factor making it spread was in gradually abolishing the institution of slavery. There’s a reason people count the years since Jesus’s birth, and it’s nothing to do with
                miracles. Slavery was completely abolished throughout Christendom by the 7th century, a process which began with the spread of Christianity and dramatically increased as the Christian reformers started to have an influence
                on secular policy, and instituted ethical reforms. It becomes an explicit injunction in the Church to disallow Christian owning Christian slaves past the 7th century, and Europe was entirely slave-free between the 7th and
                12th century. The 13th century slaves were Muslim, and the Muslim slaves pollute Europe with this again, but the institution was never all that widespread like it was in the colonies, and it is banned through secular
                legislation in the European countries that reinstated it in the 19th century.
            </p>
            <p>
                What you are right about is that there was some debate in the early Church regarding slavery, the religion wasn’t uniformly abolitionist, although it was egalitarian. The debate lasted a long time. Still, the emancipatory
                character of the religion is there right from the start, it is in the decrees of equality of Christians, and it applies to slaves (and freeing them) explcitly in the Epistle to Philemon and the Catholic tradition regarding
                Philemon freeing his slave. The canonization of the Epistle is controversial, either because it is too abolitionist in sentiment or not abolitionist enough, but there is an explicit denouncements of the slave trade in Paul,
                and .explicit recognition of equality of slave and master to make abolition inevitable, and the process does complete, although in geological time frame.
            </p>
            <p>
                The statements of St. Augustine are coming in the 3rd century, before the religion is established enough to do the major reform. There were high-class fellows in the Church, who as always, have no clue about anything, and
                want to maintain class priviledge. There was a debate about the character of the church in the canonization era, but you can see that the abolitionism stayed, because it completed. There were those who suggested the Jewish
                method of limited slavery, but the outright abolitionists won out.
            </p>
            <p>I should say that Jews also abolished slavery outright in this era, although when they did it, I don’t know.</p>
            <p>
                It was not an official policy until the 6th century or 7th century, but it is codified in Catholic doctrine that Christians may not own Christian slaves explicitly the 7th century, and abolitionism is the only real secular
                point of Christianity.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are speaking about Confederate interpretations of Christianity ignoring the real historical purpose. I don’t have any patience for this, as you are totally wrong. My “guessing” (which is just mental shorthand for
                previous reading about this) is completely historically accurate. Please don’t continue with this intellectual dishonesty, and review the real church policy on slavery properly.

                The gnostics didn’t dispute this interpretation either, but I am speaking about the centralized church, the one that made policy that’s written down that we can study, who didn’t dispute this interpretation any more than
                anyone else. NOBODY disputes the nonmilitaristic interpretation, it’s just something snarky atheists point out.

                I do keep telling you so, but you keep asserting the opposite without any evidence. The military events and the conversion events are largely separate, and the imposition of Christianity is through a social dominance process
                which is violent only after it is already dominant.

                Outright slavery was abolished in Catholic Christendom in the 7th century, there are no more slaves in Europe by that time. The modern slavery and the slavery on the periphery is something different from the main bulk of
                Catholic Europe. I am not sure about the Eastern Orthodox history, they might not have abolished slavery.
            </p>
            <p>
                The freeing of the slave is strongly encouraged by the letter, if you actually READ IT, the social equality of slaves in the Chruch is definitely explicitly stated, and Paul takes upon himself the debts of the slave, and
                asks Philemon to consider that he owes all his soul to Christianity, and to consider this price against the price of the slave’s debt. It is accepted in Catholic tradition that Philemon freed the slave, the same slave
                reappears later in the New Testament as a Bishop, and I don’t think he was moonlighting as a Bishop and a slave by day. It is clear from later Catholic doctrine that slavery became unacceptable, and you can’t falsify this,
                because this is the major historical break between slave economies and feudal economies.

                St. Paul would not agree with the confederates, but it doesn’t matter. I am not advocating theocracy here, I am just objecting to falsified readings of the purpose of Christian religion. I am more a humanist myself, but I
                try to be honest about the history.

                This is complete nonsense. There has never been an abolition of slavery which did not involve an institution outlawing it explicitly, and in the case of 7th century Europe, the institution was the church. I gave you the
                doctrine, it’s explicit 7th century Catholic doctrine that Catholics cannot own Catholic slaves, and it is effective, in that there are no slaves anymore. It is also clearly an implicit doctrine earlier, going all the way
                back to the beginning, although it is also not enforced in strict law, but in convention. Onesimus became a bishop in the Church, this is something that comes up later. We know he does not remain a slave. The epistle is
                abolitionist through and through, although also pragmatic about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea that the collapse of central authority led to emancipation is ridiculous, as slave-owners simply do not retain authority over their property through a central authority imposing it, rather through local authority
                using taskmasters with access to violent means of repression. The emancipation is directly as a result of the Church injunctions against slavery. The same is true in Judaism, but much earlier, as the Jewish religion
                emancipates all slaves after a fixed period, and that’s that, a law on temporary slavery eliminates chattel slavery in less than one generation, as slaves convert to Judaism, and then the Jewish slaves become Jewish
                freedmen.
            </p>
            <p>
                The collapse of Roman institution is the result of the decline in slavery, not the other way around. The whole Roman economy is built on the labor of slaves, and as the slaves become serfs, the centralization of the slave
                economy around the decisions of slaveholders collapses. This collapse is ongoing in the 4th-6th centuries, and it is essentially total by the time the dark ages begin. This loss of financial power weakens the military. There
                was nothing else going on except Christianization that weakened Rome to the point that it allowed the invasions other than the loss of the powerful slaveholding class. It doesn’t matter so much by then, because power has
                devolved to the Church.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the main point of Christianity, and you miss it. Serfs were now beholden to secular royalty granted by local kings, and the royalty was held in check by clergy from doing things like reinstituting slavery, and all
                the private large slaveholders are history. That’s the Christian revolution, and it’s Christian. It’s annoying that you are blind to this, as it is the single most significant transition in human civilization.
            </p>
            <p>
                I should add that this emancipation process was completed in Israel first, where slavery was not a permanent institituion, at least not in the era of Priestly Judaism and Leviticus law. Jews were nearly all free in Palestine
                before the Babylonians and Romans came, they lived as autonomous agents with occasional 6 year bondsmen to repay debt, and a full reset of the financial system every 49 or 50 years, in the Jubilee. Being universally free and
                universally literate, of course they resisted external occupation worse than anyone, and Christianity eventually exported the same freedom outside of the confines of Judaism. They left the Jews alone because the Jews weren’t
                the ones enslaving them.

                Christian slavery of Christians is removed in Christendom by explicit Church decree in the 7th century, which is before 699, not 604, although slavery was already rare (perhaps extremely rare, I don’t know) in 604. The
                declines in slave population is, according are supposed to begin in the 3rd or 4th century, as I suppose is estimated from estimated economic data, I don’t care, as all I cared about is the approximate slave population
                numbers. I found the name of the church fellow who pushed through the abolition, but it is also clear from the socioeconomic changes and political system changes that this is the end of a long process and not a sudden thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The SECOND slavery abolition in the 18th century, and 19th century is abolishing the SECOND period of slavery from ~1250-1865. This is three times further removed from ancient slavery in time as we are removed from the
                second abolition. I explained this to you several times, but you are obviously decided you would rather dogmatically play pretend games online to avoid losing face.

                Not exactly “NA NA NA”, more like “come back when you have more intellectual honesty”. Ok, you are acknowledging the main slavery reforms now, although I would prefer it if you say outright “Chrisitianity was a slave
                revolt”, because that’s exactly what it was. The emancipation is the main reason people go around revering Christmas all over the world, more or less as they revere a Juneteenth.
            </p>
            <p>
                The doctrines about slavery you are talking about are crazy isolated exceptions to the otherwise universal rule of emancipation, and they are analogous to debt-slavery in Judaism, and I don’t know anything about them, nor do
                I care about these details so much. I accept that there is a complicated dance of pro and anti slavery forced through the early midieval era, but but you must also accept that a doctrine that frees 99.9% of all slaves and
                puts the remainder under conditions of non-absolute non-generational servitude cannot be considered “condoning of slavery” in any form. It is an abolition of ancient slavery, replacing it with various forms of penal slavery
                and debt-slavery used to enforce social law.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ancient widespread majority slavery is beat back to the point where it is an extremely unusual condition, essentially abolished among the Christian populations of Europe. The condition that you can own non-Christian
                slaves is not as much a problem as it seems, at least not in the midieval era, as this does not lead to generational servitude, because of conversion. That is, it doesn’t lead to generational servitude until people run away
                to distant colonies and import large numbers of non-Christian folks to serve as slaves without emancipation on conversion, or create protestant Churches which temporarily turn away from the doctrine of liberation. It’s
                analogous to the doctrines of ancient Jews, which also required emancipation upon conversion, but it was not a problem among the Jews either, as male children of slaves must be circumcized, allowing for easy conversion, and
                the practical result of Jewish law is that ancient Judea is free of the scourge of absolute generational servitude, probably quite a while before the Babylonians invade, and certainly before the Romans come. This doctrine is
                what distinguishes monotheism from other practices, any religion that led to ancient slave emancipation is more or less monotheistic.
            </p>
            <p>
                I agree that the modern emancipation is more total and more permanent than the first Christian emancipation, because it is enforced by anambiguous secular law and unmodifiable religious decree today. But the religious
                emancipation of the early middle ages more or less removed slavery from Europe entirely. The abolitionist interpretations of Christianity are dominant through Europe until modern times, they are only perversely interpreted
                as condoning slavery in the Confederate south, and this is not a Catholic doctrine, those people are all Protestant and make up their own slavery-condoning denomination. The slaves in the South, although largely illiterate,
                still picked up on the purpose and message of Christianity, pretty much only the slaves (and the abolitionist northerners) understood what it’s all about, and embraced it more than the slave-owners in this period. To this
                day, the African American community is very committed to Christian religion, and this is tied to the recent experience of servitude.

                That’s not a “secret doctrine”, that’s a structural property of nearly all movements that become powerful, with the best exception being modern liberalism (although this becomes violent too in America in suppressing Shay’s
                rebellion, and other monetary insurrections). There’s relatively little of that in Christian history as compared to previous ancient history, precisely because the major doctrine opposes violence. But there is still some,
                because there is still power, and where there is power there is violence. The imposition of opinion is at first voluntary when the movement is weak, as it has no other choice at this point, and then looks for excuses to
                become violent when it is the majority opinion. This violence is what modern liberalism is designed to counteract, by imposing individual freedoms. It has nothing to do with any secret violent teachings, these are just not
                there in Christianity, any more than Jews have injunctions to slaughter non-Jews and drink their blood.

                I have to agree with you completely regarding post 1300 Christianity, it backtracked on this accomplishment in a shameful and reprehensible way, and forgot its founding purpose. But this is a perversion of the intention of
                the aims of the religion. The perversion in the US in Mormonism is especially pronounced, but in all Southern denominations it was perverted in the same way, to claim that it encourages unlimited chattel slavery. Chattel
                slavery is what Christianity is designed to eradicate, and it worked nearly as well as Judaism eradicated it in Judea in an earlier era. while it worked in the transition from ancient times to midieval times, it stopped
                working in the modern era, both because it was splintered, and also because Popes were always on the side of power.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not a Christian, or an idealist, I just try to give credit where credit is due. The transformation away from ancient majority chattel slavery is clearly Christian, as it happens simultaneously with Christianization,
                although at a glacial pace.

                It isn’t a social process, anyone can do it if they have the time and energy to post original material and follow the discussion, which in this case, I took time to do, because this cause is important to me. My long-winded
                posts are required because others are either deliberately lying or doing propaganda, and the point of this is to demonstrate that these are useless, as one person doing counter-propaganda without listening can easily
                counteract fifty or a hundred doing propaganda the other way. So best stop doing propaganda unless you are right.

                the text matters. The only reason I am motivated to post long material is because I am right here, so I don’t have any worries about acceptance. That comes slowly at best, when you are right, as people slowly think about
                things themselves. As for “no one listened”, that’s just more propaganda, as I can see that due to my verbal diarrhea there is no more consensus here, some people got tired of arguing and left, and I got some hate-messages

                and this is what you don’t get, ONLINE THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS CREDIBILITY, only the text matters, and people verifying various statements for themselves using the nebula of online resources all around us. A person who
                makes three correct statements and one outrageous WHOPPER doesn’t lose credibility, the three correct statements are verified, and the whopper is corrected, and nobody has any more or any less credibility at the end than at
                the beginning, no matter who said what. But the truth becomes clear to everyone along the way.

                With that way of thinking, “right” and “authority” become synonyms, and truth is simply a social process of consensus. This is the Heideggerrian view, and it is simply false, and even a small amount of experience with the
                hard sciences shows you this. The Copernicans were right long before they were accepted or even gaining converts rather than losing them. Archimedes was right 1800 years before he was completely understood. Cavalieri was
                right even though he was heckled and marginalized. The process is exposed in a very clear way in mathematics, and in science, because the people who are right are, by statistics, nearly always very different from the people
                who are powerful, and this is why studying physics, engineering, computer science, etc, is important for clarifying social processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the case of social questions, there is a view that these more difficult to analyze things do not have an objective truth to them, they way chemistry does. The notion of religious teleology (or teleology of truth) gives a
                definition of “right” here also: right is that which people eventually come to agree on. Eventually leaves a long time for discussion and debate, and the mechanism is a long consensus-forming process which examines all the
                various arguments one by one. This process produces authority at the end, but does not require authority to operate. It only requires intellectual honesty. This is different from the Heideggerrian definition because the
                structure of the discussion process itself is important, the structure of the debate informs you whether you can trust the consensus that is produced from it. Pontification from authority doesn’t help sway things one way or
                another, at least given a long enough time. Open discussion is foolproof, because no point of view can be shut out, except those points of view that nobody thought of yet, but these are quickly produced when people sit and
                think for a little bit.
            </p>
            <p>
                The example of science is useful, because here you can verify the truth of the propositions for yourself, completely independently of the social process, and then check how long it takes for the parallel social process to
                work itself out, in this case where there is a nearly purely individual method of evaluating true and false. You learn that it does work itself out, but it takes forever, and the length of time is contingent on all sorts of
                events in history, like which nation won a war. But in the end, the person who got it right, in the sense of correct mathematics and science, always is eventually authoritative. And for the handful of examples where this
                fails, the person usually gets some small thing wrong that blocks the acceptance, like Geoffrey Chew, or else the idea is just on the way up, like Hugh Everett III. In either case, the internet makes the process go by an
                order of magnitude faster than before.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mechanism of social progress requires freedom of participation, tolerance of wrong ideas, examination of all related ideas without bias, and relentless intellectual honesty, so that you point out your own mistakes FIRST,
                before other people do, and you don’t feel bad when you get something wrong, rather, you learn something. These are the principles of physics discourse, and they are very alien to social politics, where you are supposed to
                simply twist and bend every statement and fact to your maximum political advantage. The zeroeth approximation to physics discourse is to bend and twist every statement and fact to your maximums DIS-advantage. This is what
                people are free to do on online forums without repercussion, because you can do so anonymously and remotely. It produces physicist-level of clarity, but too few people do this right now.
            </p>
            <p>
                Online forums don’t exclude billions exactly, although if you are talking about rural electrification in the Sudan, you might be missing some voices, although you would be surprised at how resourceful 10,000 people are at
                finding at least one linked in representative. The real exclusion is of the second fellow with the same idea, as repetition is a waste of time, so the first person who has something to say sort of owns it, and needs to
                defend it, because everyone else with the same point of view doesn’t want to duplicate the effort.

                Heidegger is a moral stain and a vacuous idiot, Neitzsche is a terrible crackpot, and I have no patience for academic philosophy, as aside from the short lived logical positivist movement, it is all a terrible intellectual
                fraud. The continental school has produced nothing of value aside from Marx, who was really an economist and not a philosopher, and all the rest can be condensed into a five page summary which would be hard to fill without

            <p>The points of agreement you see are superficial:</p>
            <p>1. the ability to formulate a new position and maintain it in the face of hostile propaganda.</p>
            <p>This is something that the post-modernists encourage. It is also something science encourages. The critical difference being that you go with the new position only as far as it is correct.</p>
            <p>2. The willingness to use anti-logical arguments, like ad-hominem and propaganda</p>
            <p>
                This is a superficial point of similiarity. The crucial distinction is that these ARE NOT ARGUMENTS AT ALL. These are simply used to diffuse and counteract the propaganda value of authoritative bullcrap, which usually comes
                in the form of an equal amount of veiled or explicit ad-hominems and anti-logical argument on the other side.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any logical argument proceeds in parallel to the ad-homs or anti-logical rhetoric and has no relation to this anti-logical nonsense, little idiot. You can remove all the ad-homs, twit, and the content is unaltered,
                prickface, and consists of a normal rational discussion of the usual sort, testicle-brain.
            </p>
            <p>3. The dismissal of authority structures.</p>
            <p>
                This is the sole point of agreement with the post-modernists. The difference is that one is beholden to the same standard of truth that has been understood since ancient times, now bereft of social authority, proceeding with
                as many as desire to join, without any barrier to entry, without any barrier of unduly obfuscated language, and with the text itself, judged by independent analysis, shared and evaluated by textual responses being the only
                acceptable method of arbitration of acceptance or rejection. No socially mediated authority required. That’s not postmodernism exactly. That’s internet discussions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The philosophical underpinning is totally different. There is no rejection of truth here, no rejection of logic, and no rejection of fact or placing discourse above content. It’s the exact opposite, it is simply a rejection
                of traditional authority. And that’s not post-modernism. That’s Galileo and Pauli.

                I never use ad-hominems against a person who isn’t using various anti-logical rhetorical devices. It’s just that I MAKE IT OBVIOUS, by calling you a crapstain, while you MAKE IT SUBTLE, by using a high-falutin tone and the
                dismissive annoying language of authority. IT DOESN’T MATTER WHICH YOU USE, BECAUSE BOTH ARE EQUAL IN PROPAGANDA VALUE. Once there is enough ad-homs and ridiculous rhetoric flying around on all sides, all the anti-logical
                arguments become completely irrelevant, on both sides. When you force people to pick sides in a conflict, they will either butt out entirely, or they will review the objective evidence.

                Hicks is also an idiot (funny enough, I just read his stuff, as he has an attack on post-modernism from a traditionalist liberal point of view). He is writing explicitly anti-socialist texts, which in itself is not a
                problem, but he makes the following outright OUTRAGEOUS ERRORS:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. He claims Stalin is responsible for 60 million deaths in the Soviet Union, a country of ~200 million people, and ~120 million in Stalin’s time. This figure is the latest upswing from Solzhenietsin, to 1 in 2 Soviet
                citizens dead under Stalin, the previous figure was 20 million, or 1 in 6 Soviet citizens dead (in addition to the ~12-15 million war casualties). That’s really awful, the way the population of the Soviet Union declined by
                50% as Stalin murdered every other person, like Hitler did with the Jews. You can see it when you ask typical Russians or Ukranians about their familiy, half their family disappears in the 1930s, just like typical Jewish
                families in the 1940s.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course not! That’s obviously ridiculous, and from a survey of former Soviet citizens, or a glance at the population statistics for the era, the rate of death is about 1%-3% at best. Hicks buys this MENTALLY RETARDED
                bourgeoise propaganda without any critical review. Stalin’s “purges” usually involved firing people from various positions of power, only the most powerful or top people were executed, but these are the most visible people.
                These purges were AWFUL, but the result was on the order of 300,000 deaths, as revealed in the Khruschev era. There were on the order of 2-3 million imprisonments, with a mortality rate in prison of order 10-30%, and you can
                do the math. These are roughly comparable to the cumulative suffering and death from street homelessness in the US, although I am not condoning either of these horrific endemic structural democides.

                The Ukranian famine killed at most on the order of 3-5 million folks, it is hard to tell, because this is a demographic estimate, so it includes babies who were not concieved. The net total of deaths in Stalin’s time from
                state repression is best estimated on the order of 2-3 million people. The loss of life in the 1920s civil war was higher, and the loss of life in the Irish potato famine, a similar disaster due to liberal capitalism, is
                higher still, and from a much smaller initial population. I am not white-washing Stalin’s very real crimes, I am trying to show you what THESE ACTUALLY WERE, instead of doing propaganda for liberalism.

                The same estimate inflation works for Mao. Mao’s famine killed less than it prevented births, because food was relatively equally distributed outside of certain areas where people misreported needs, as is usual in the
                stupidity of central planning. The demographic dip in China amounts to ~30-60 million lost people, but these nearly entirely consist of babies never concieved. You can see a similar but smaller dip in the US during the years
                of the Great Depression. The baby-boom is a reaction to this, people put off having babies until they were economically secure. I am not condoning Mao’s crimes either, which were very real. I am telling you what they
                actually were, rather than doing liberal propaganda.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not defending Stalinism of Maoism, I am attacking Stephen Hicks, for uncritically repeating propaganda. This is common now in anti-intellectual circles, and it is always rewarded. Online, it is extremely easy to fix, I
                just did so. To verify these assertions, you need to look at the actual content of Khruschev’s 1956 speech, and the actual demographic estimates for China’s terrible times in the 1960s. These were terrible enough as they
                were, without lying.
            </p>
            <p>2. Hicks claims that the Soviet Union economic output was roughly comparable in 1917 and 1956, that there was no significant economic growth.</p>
            <p>
                This is complete MADE-UP NONSENSE. The Soviet Union industrialized in the first and second five-year plans, from ~1930 to ~1940, literacy rates went to 100% in this period, and the last unemployment office was closed because
                unemployment had dropped to 0%. The reason unemployment was at 0% (it really was) is because the Stalinist hiring model paid managers by the number of workers they could attract, and had a free labor movement, with prices
                set by supply and demand. It was secretly a pure free market, and the pressure was to get every worker into a position. This continued through the 1980s, and unemployment was at 0% or as close as one could measure,
                throughout the period. But the supply/demand wages led to weird phenomenon, like factory laborers making twice as much sometimes as professors or managers, putting pressure on people to fill what are lower-paid positions in
                the west. This created a huge amount of resentment, because more powerful positions were lower paid, but it is consistent with the predictions of an idealized frictionless liberal free-market model for labor, which is more
                or less what was instituted in the second Soviet constitution.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way Hicks shows no growth in the USSR is by comparing farm output in 1917, when nearly the entire population was farming in small plots, to 1956, when the farming was done with a small percentage of the population in
                collective farms, and the rest worked as industrial workers. This is an insane economic comparison, and dismisses the many-fold industrail growth in the Soviet economy during the 1930s and 1940s. The USSR had double-digit
                growth rates until the 1960s, which is why Khruschev predicted that it would eclipse the west. The rate of growth was roughly equal to the west in the 1960s, and stagnated in the 1970s and 1980s. The end of communism was
                marked by a 50% collapse in the GDP of the USSR, as the state industries were privatized, and cooperation agreements with Eastern block countries collapsed. The USSR’s economy was approximately 30% to 50% of the US’s during
                the 1950s-1970s, with a similar population. It never caught up, but it wasn’t anywhere near 1917, it industrialized and educated the whole population. It also was completely competitive in the hard sciences, and about 4-5
                years behind in electronics development. This lag only became intolerable when personal computer technology was developing, because 4-5 years in computers is an eternity.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am NOT ADVOCATING USSR STYLE SOCIALISM. I am advocating ACADEMIC HONESTY. If Hicks can’t even be bothered to get his figures right, rather preferring to repeat figures pulled out of the nether-regions of propagandists, how
                can he discuss these issues objectively?
            </p>
            <p>
                This type of dishonesty is used by the media as a marker— it tells you who you are supposed to pick out the “great philosophers” now. The great philosopher is the one who goes along with the currently accepted propaganda.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, I mostly agree with Hicks in his analysis of Nietzsche and post-modernism, but he is not intellectually honest, as is revealed by him swallowing absurd mass death figures for communist atrocities without actually
                checking the figures for himself, and by completely misunderstanding the structure of the Soviet economy and the growth rates of this economy in its prime.
            </p>
            <p>3. He associates post-modernism with the left, even though it is a creation of the fascist right.</p>
            <p>
                Post-modernism was ping-ponged between right and left, because it is essentially an ATHEISTIC philosophy, denying the notion of truth. It has nothing intrinsically to do with the left. It was due to Nazi Heidegger, and it
                was mostly embraced by right-leaning German intellectuals.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was taken over by the left because it gave a framework independent of tradition for discussing religious notions. But there is a much better framework for this which is monotheistic, in superrational decision making. This
                is actually monotheistic ethics, with a notion of a personal God, and this is what I go by. So I can ignore all post modernism completely.

                I DON’T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT YOUR FAMILY. I have a grandfather brutally enslaved and starved by the Nazis and large chunks of murdered family including people who fled under piles of corpses. What difference does it make? I
                still verified the assertions of genocide objectively, by READING AND UNDERSTANDING THOSE GODDAMN NAZIS, and TAKING THEIR PHILOSOPHY SERIOUSLY, to see what exactly they were thinking. Individual suffering has nothing to do
                with academic truth, academic truth is much more important, since academic honesty is the best way to prevent future suffering. Understanding what was going on is the only way to prevent such horrors from recurring. Any lie,
                even a “noble lie” is a crime against the literature.
            </p>
            <p>
                The current propaganda claims about the rates of state murder in the Soviet Union are a MADE UP FANTASY, which is good, because it lets you identify dishonest stupid academics like Hicks. The claims that stalin killed 16% of
                the population is patently absurd, let alone the recent claim that he killed 50% of the population. He can only have been responsible for 3% at most, because you don’t see the effect on total population figures. The
                repression was terrible, but that doesn’t mean you get to LIE ABOUT IT. Tell the truth, it was bad enough as it was.

            <p>There are two different kinds of atheism: scientific atheism and anti-scientific atheism, and they usually comprise two completely disjoint sets of people.</p>
            <p>
                Scientific atheism is the rationalist science folks, who object to supernatural nonsense, and they identify religion with supernatural stuff. These people generally continue to accept the non-supernatural consequences of
                monotheistic religious thinking without knowing the religious pedigree of these ideas. They accept the equality of humanity, the sanctity of individual life, the abhorrence of slavery, the humanist notions of progress and so
                on, without associating these with the text of the Bible.
            </p>
            <p>
                The anti-scientific atheism is aware that these conceptions are due to monotheistic religion, and seeing that the scientific atheists have weakened the supernatural basis of the claims, they then try to substitute other
                quasi-religious but non-monotheistic claims instead of traditional monotheistic religion. This is the program that Nietzsche started, Heidegger continued, and the post-modernists picked up on. They used it to justify any
                position which stood in contrast to the religious tradition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Religion, when you look at it deeply, is not about supernatural nonsense. That’s what it claims in its founding texts, but these supernatural stories are ultimately irrelevant to the practice of the faith. The basic notion
                is instituting superrational decision making, and for monotheistic religions, it is to extend the superrational decisions to all humanity. Superrational decision making looks superficially collectivist, although it is also
                informed by individual intuitions, and it forms a conception of an all intelligent super-duper mind that is aware of everything everyone does and wants everyone to be good.
            </p>
            <p>
                This meta property of superrational collectives is what the religions are decorating up with supernatural window-dressing. It has nothing to do with miracles, nor does it have anything to do with science. It is about
                constructing a consistent all-encompassing superrational ethics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The science-atheists generally accept the superrational ethics without question, as it is deeply socially embedded already, and react with horror to the abuses in atheist states like the USSR, or the worse abuses in
                Nietzschian states like Nazi Germany. They do not understand what religion is, and they attack the parts which are worthy of ridicule, the nonsense supernatural stuff. That stuff is just propaganda tacked on to a social
                system, it is not at all what the system of religions are about.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Heideggerian atheists understand the purpose of religion and attack it at the base, by replacing the thinking with a self-consistent non-monotheistic conception. This is a comprehending attack, and it is much more
                credible. The supporters of post-modernism distrust monotheistic religion because they distrust tradition, and that makes sense. But one should understand the monotheistic insight indepedently of tradition, by understanding
                superrational decision making, and the universal concept of God, without relying on historical texts or made-up miracles. There are enough non-supernatural real miracles, like eliminating slavery, and instituting science, to
                establish the superrational monotheistic conception on.

            <p>Yeah, yeah, nitwit, sometimes the deniers are just objectively right, which is why you need to do a review in all cases.</p>
            <p>
                In the case of the USSR, the mainstream deniers are 100% right, the ones that don’t dismiss Stalin’s democide as propaganda, but dismiss the recent inflation of those numbers as propaganda. These folks use official figures
                to compute what was happening, and they are doing good historical work. The other side just pulls numbers out of the ass, and does so to make the average bigger than Hitler. There is no methodology to the 60 million figure,
                it’s just designed so that the average with 2 million, with weighting, will converge to approximately 20 million, so that Stalin will be “worse than Hitler”. It’s that moronic, and it is deserving of no respect. So ptui on
                YOU, twit, you are condoning historical LIES which are designed to block honest scholarship and dismiss honest historians into the margin. There is no excuse for that.
            </p>
            <p>
                The evidence is not only from official speeches, it’s from the population figures, from a random sampling of individuals that were arrested and either executed or served their time (I know many physicists who went through
                this in the Stalin era), and asking people from the Soviet Union which of their relatives died.
            </p>
            <p>
                NONE OF THESE are compatible with 20 million death toll, NOT ONE. They all point to a 2-3 million death toll, consistent with the population statistics, and compilation of executions. The compilation of execution figures has
                been done using post-Soviet figures from previously classified archives, and I trust the careful historian’s modern figures of ~700,000 executions in Stalin’s era (I didn’t know these were available), with perhaps a
                comparable number in the later Stalin years, but no more.
            </p>
            <p>
                The demographic figures for the Ukranian famine are much harder to come by, and here you need to sample Ukranian families to know. You simply cannot trust anyone on this, because THEY ALL LIE THROUGH THEIR TEETH, without
                conspiracy, simply by repeating Solzhenitsin, because this is how you get attention and money.
            </p>
            <p>
                But given the acceptance of the famine in Khruschev times, we can know that there was a serious, serious death toll here, and I trust the demographic estimates of 5-7 million lost Ukranians in the 1930s, although this
                involves lost births as well, so the best estimate of the true death toll is on the order of 2-4 million. I don’t know what it was exactly, because I can’t trust the writing of anyone on this, because it is corrupted by
                propaganda, and influenced by the desire to produce as big a number as possible.
            </p>
            <p>You are an irresponsible FRAUD, and I do not accept your political showmanship as acceptable discourse. Any ad-hominems pale in comparison to this kind of dishonesty. Be ashamed, dude, be ashamed.</p>

                You stupid twit, the population census figures for the Soviet Union were ALWAYS HONEST AND RELIABLE, unlike your INSIPID INSINUATIONS, these figures were used for everything from labor apportionment. industrial relocations,
                planning for industrial cities, they were central to the process of planning, and these people took their planning seriously. You are now disputing the SOVIET CENSUS? What data don’t you dispute? You retarded ape. Give it
                up. You’re just blowing rhetoric. It doesn’t work online.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were those who were killed and those who were released. YOU CAN ASK ANYONE IN THE FORMER SOVIET UNION. The answer is always the same. Everyone was scared, there were two relative who got in trouble with the
                authorities, one who was arrested and released, sometimes one executed. That’s typical, and it’s consistent with the numbers I give. The emigrees are OVERREPRESENTATIVE of the repressed people, as they consist of
                bourgeoisie. The mass of people just went about working trying to make the best living they could under the system, without making waves, and that 99% was left entirely alone. The problem is that among the HIGHER UPS, the
                only “people that count” in the views of Western media, the persecution rate and execution rate came up to 16%, and among the top of the top, the revolutionaries of 1917, the rate of execution was 50% or higher. It is all
                consistent with what I told you, because what I told you is the GODDAMN TRUTH, and truth doesn’t change.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were no mass executions of entire families, the persecution in the Soviet Union was ALWAYS individual, with good party members in the same family as persecuted dissidents. The only family that got killed were the
                Romanofs. Famines don’t work the way you are claiming, they don’t claim families, they claim individuals who succumb to weakness and disease, and young children, who are neglected due to weakness. You are simply a LYING
                FRAUD, and I don’t have patience for anything you say anymore. Go live in your own universe, leave the rest of the world alone.

                Six million Jews were not killed, four and a half to five million Jews were killed, and a couple of hundred thousand died from typhus in addition. These are the Jewish organization estimates from 1945, these are the numbers
                you find from population census figures, and this is what is consistent with the deportation records and testimonies. The general rule is that the closer you get to the events, the better the estimates become. The Soviet
                famine figures and the Soviet camp deaths were estimated many decades, before and after the archives opened, and the stories were always consistent, until, in the 1990s, in a spate of popular books, SUDDENLY THEY BALLOON TO

                The way in which these numbers are produced and percolate is A DISGUSTING SHAMEFUL STAIN on the modern academy, and it is precisely for this purpose that the internet was made, to CORRECT this lying, as I am doing now,
                without giving them ANY SHRED OF RESPECT, just tearing them apart mouth to anus, claim by claim, like the Jewish center ripped apart the holocaust deniers.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is one of the worst ACADEMIC DISEASES in academia today, it is a REPULSIVE SELL OUT of monstrous proportions, and one must not be complicit with it in the least, as it is WORSE THAN HOLOCAUST DENIAL, because unlike
                holocaust denial, holocaust fabrication is something DECENT STUPID PEOPLE GO ALONG WITH. It is a deliberate distortion of history designed to bury the study of the history of half the world in a mountain of bullcrap.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is also why holocaust denial must never be made criminal, as any restrictions on speech always eventually make it impossible to get at historical truth. The FABRICATION of 20 Stalin MEGADEATHS is actually a great weapon
                in Neo Nazi propaganda, because they say “See! Look how easy it is to create a genocide out of thin air”. Of course, it is not, because there are ASSHOLES LIKE ME contesting it, who will CONTEST IT TO THE GRAVE.

                “historians” who create numbers out of thin air, to advance their own power. Then you publish a “list” of all the opinions together, and I AM SUPPOSED TO TAKE ALL THE ESTIMATES SERIOUSLY?? GO SUCK YOUR BALLS. I KNOW HOW TO

                population statistics, done region by region, over many decades, and over several changes of governments, which are consistent with each other and which are consistent with observations and external CIA estimates. The
                Soviets didn’t lie too much in their five year plans either— the statistics for production quotas were manipulated to look good in ways OTHER THAN lying about quantity of production. The “lies” about Chernobyl are simply
                slow announcement, due to official embarrassment, it took a day or two too long. The response was entirely appropriate once the government was active, the Soviet Union in 1985 had an entirely responsible relatively open
                government for the first time, certainly more responsible and open than the nightmares that people have now in that region.

                You simply have no idea what internal gosplan documents looked like, you never read them. You never looked at the discussions of party officials, and compiled statistics, and planning figures, and I have (they are boring but
                extremely informative). There can simply be no fudging when you are planning an entire economy, as you have people accepting deliveries on each quantitiy you produce, document and send off. The fudging comes in the ignoring
                of needs you didn’t anticipate, and in overproducing certain goods that you know about at the expense of others you are ignorant of.

                You ALSO have no idea what a death rate of 20 million looks like in a country of 160 million. It’s a CATASTROPHE you cannot miss. It’s deaths all over, it’s numbers appropriate to the black plague. You would see mass deaths
                in nearly every family, it is a HUMONGOUS rate of death, it would be impossible to miss, and you would be able to see it by a small random sample of Soviet citizens. IT SIMPLY IS NOT THERE. IT IS EMBARASSING, OBVIOUS,
                POLITICAL, LYING. An easy question you can ask: “did more relatives of yours die as combatants in WWII or from political repression under Stalin?” You can easily find the answer to this without any experts to help, and the
                WWII deaths are compiled independenly, we know exactly what these were.

                Another source of economic error came in the black market and small farming, stolen goods, etc, and this hidden economic activity was biggest in the 1970s and early 1980s. It goes above ground in 1985 with Perestroika, and
                in the last years it is regulated business activity, and it is estimated properly. THERE WAS NEVER POPULATION FUDGING, as nobody cared to hide anything, nor could they even if they wanted to, as the figures were compiled in
                many offices region by region.

                The “dekulakization” was the process of confiscating property, it removed a social class of peasants. It didn’t proceed by killing all the kulaks and their relatives, but by removing their property, and arresting or killing
                those who resisted. These are included in the judicial and extra-judicial executions compiled by honest historians. It was socially unsettling, and led to the loss of property by millions of people, but not to their deaths,
                as you can see BY SIMPLY ASKING PEOPLE WHOSE RELATIVES OWNED PROPERTY. The result was TURNED INTO MASS MURDER BY LYING MORONIC PHONY HISTORIANS IN THE 1990s, rather, I should say, to GREATER mass murder than the ALREADY
                TERRIBLE repressive executions by the hundreds of thousands. It was known what was going on in the early 1930s outside the Soviet Union, the process was widely denounced in Western media, and collectivization led to
                hard-to-estimate famine deaths in the way it leads to drops in production whenever it is tried, as for example it did in China, Yugoslavia, and elsewhere. Yugoslavia reversed collectivization after less than a year, and
                farming output rebounded immediately. Cuba never even collectivized the farming because they learned from this terrible experience. In the US, the large factory farms have a similar drop in efficiency compared to small plots
                farmed individually, but the arable land is larger, and the privately managed factory farming was significantly more efficient than state farming. This was Gorbachev’s specialty, he was a specialist in farming and a
                specialist in Ukrainian production, as this is what he did in the planning days. He also saw firsthand suffering from hunger in the 1930s, and had firsthand experience with collectivization.
            </p>
            <p>
                The famine was real, people went hungry, including a young Gorbachev, but NOBODY HAS GOOD ESTIMATES for the death toll, the death toll is estimated using the dip in the very same census data that you are MORONICALLY
                contesting. Death tolls in communist famines involve fewer direct victims of starvation, because the distribution of food is relatively uniform and there is access to medical care for those who succumb to hunger or disease.
                The 1940s Dutch famine is an example where a capitalist country successfully mitigated mass deaths by enforcing an equitable distribution of the much-too-small supply of food. The Soviets could not be as good as the Dutch,
                but they were better than England and the Irish. My personal estimate, coming from MY ASS, is that between 2 and 3 million people died directly as a result of the collectivization famine. This is reasonably consistent with
                the demographic declines of the early 1930s. It COULD BE HIGHER, but I TRUST MY ASS OVER ANY ESTIMATE COMING TODAY, because of the RECURRING DELIBERATE OBVIOUS LYING REGARDING ALL THIS STUFF. You can’t trust people in the
                field to be honest anymore, let alone a mentally defective pontificating philosopher who never did any deep random sampling survey of mortality rates from various causes in the early 1930s nor ever made a consistent picture.

                there’s only one side pushing back, and in these cases, you get monstrous errors due to people following self-interest. Believe me, it is not in my self interest to explain the honest estimates of Soviet death. If I just
                said “Stalin killed 20 million” or better yet “Stalin killed 60 million”, I would get absolutely no trouble, and if I wrote a book that said this, I would get on TV.

                The Soviets were EXTREMELY HONEST internally regarding production, because they had all the documents. The KULAKS were not LIQUIDATED by TAKING THEIR FOOD, they were liquidated by confiscating their farm, and then taking
                their production, and they would the be expected to join a Kolkhoz and get their wages and buy their bread at the same government store as everyone else. They didn’t have enough to buy in the early 1930s, because Ukraine was
                undersupplied, but the famine’s effects were not as lopsided as made to appear in the West, and regions abutting the Ukraine suffered too, although perhaps not as harshly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The LYING consists of DISTORTING THE NUMBERS to say 20 million or 60 million died. TO CLAIM THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE LIQUIDATED WITH ALL THEIR RELATIVES AND THEIR EXTENDED FAMILIES AND THE EXTENDED FAMILY BEYOND AND SO ON,
                RECURSIVELY, IS BEYOND PREPOSTEROUS, IT IS COMPLETELY INCOMPREHENSIBLE STUPIDITY. I CAN’T EVEN BELIEVE ANYONE WOULD SUGGEST THIS WITH A STRAIGHT FACE.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can do the Holocaust estimates on Jews using this method, a typical surviving Polish family lost 70% of members, and this is all survivor bias, because a lot of families were liquidated entirely. But the estimate comes out
                ballpark right, as it does for Hungarians, for French, and so on. You can, simply by examining family history, get an ORDER OF MAGNITUDE ESTIMATE, and this allows you to know which of the detailed historians is telling the
                truth.

                I don’t expect ANYONE to trust me! I HAVE NO AUTHORITY, AND NOBODY ELSE DOES EITHER. I expect anyone interested in this to look up the Ukrainian and Soviet census data, to examine the arguments that people made for 3 million
                deaths, 5 million deaths, 20 million deaths and 60 million deaths, to ask a dozen or so Russians and Ukranians to tell their family stories of the period, and to CONCLUDE AFTERWARDS that the true number of famine victims is
                between 2-5 million, and NOWHERE NEAR 20 million.

                Well, I think that kind of statement is not controversial, except inasmuch as it can be read as praise. Thanks, but I mostly just used my potty mouth here, not much more. I’m not asking to change people’s minds on authority,
                I don’t have any. I am asking for people to read the debate, and make up their minds after reviewing the issues, after reading related material they feel is relevant, and after hearing all the various arguments, as best they
                can. Or perhaps not, and then just to leave it alone, and keep a mind as open as they feel appropriate.

                It is difficult to evaluate things without knowing basic stuff, but I think you are overestimating the barriers of education today, when you have plentiful online resources. While it is true that in the past, the access to
                education was limited, with only a few people in universities having access to the best up-to-date literature, now that access at the ordinary undergraduate level is universal, and either today or very soon, with the opening
                of the scientific literature, it will be completely universal at all levels, even the most cutting edge. Anyone can read anything now., u
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you have access to literature, education is mostly a matter of being pointed to the right stuff to read and review, to a quick summary in case it is unduly long or arcane, and to the right fora to get answers to the
                questions that arise when reading it. I think that this barrier is relatively negligible today for anyone under the age of 30, certainly as compared to when I was growing up. Young people can find and read literature very
                quickly. Once you do this, you can check any claims for yourself, so long as you have enough intellectual honesty to evaluate claims with less and less of a bias.

                With this model, expertise becomes widely diffused, and the role of experts shrinks dramatically— you don’t have to look to an expert to be told what to believe, and the public can serve as a check on the experts, in those

                The mention of hunger was a state offence in 1950, it wasn’t an offence in 1959, when the Soviet Union was trying to get its act together. The attacks on the census bureau did lead to fudging problems. Such census problems
                were LOCALIZED, and can be worked around by any good historian by reviewing local labor and production numbers which include economic figures which are verified internally, which do not suffer from fudging problems because
                they are not ever delivered to Mr. Joseph. I WASN’T USING THE 170 MILLION CENSUS, NOBODY TOOK THOSE INFLATED NUMBERS SERIOUSLY, NOT INTERNALLY AND NOT EXTERNALLY.
            </p>
            <p>
                The collectivization famine led millions of people to go hungry, and a certain number of weakened people died of hunger or disease, possibly two million, maybe six million (you need to verify these sorts of claims with a
                personally conducted survey of random Ukranain families). Informal estimates of Ukrainian population decline in 1932-33 are of about 5 million deaths, and it seems to be greater than Ukrainian deaths in WWII, although you
                need to verify this by reviewing randomly selected family records, and seeing the statistics for mortality in WWII compared to death by starvation. Both are widely randomly distributed, and the comparison is fair. PLEASE DO
                THE COMPARISON, because I want to know what was actually happening. You can start with your own family, and that of Ukrainians you know— what’s the number and ratio of WWII deaths and 1932-33 famine deaths?
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s difficult to know what was happening because there is a GOVERNMENT making DISHONEST, LYING, STRUCTURAL PROPAGANDA, and IDIOTS LIKE YOU lying with them, repeating RIDICULOUS ASSERTIONS where every confiscation of
                property and arrest gets turned into an execution. This is LYING about human misery, and also profiting from it. Just BE HONEST and do the estimates independently.

                The Ukrainian famine numbers were first acknowledged during the Khruschov thaw, when Soviet citizens acquired some freedom of speech and press to discuss Stalin’s problems. The famine was discussed OPENLY AGAIN in
                Gorbachev’s time, who personally suffered from hunger during the collectivization period. It wasn’t disguised in the 1980s, it was analyzed FOR THE SECOND TIME. This is the period when I went into these events in depth,
                because data was available, and it was of topical interest.

                The current claims of 20 million deaths is ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS, and cannot be abided in an environment of academic honesty. It is MAKING A MOCKERY of other mass-murder claims, and it shows a level of DISHONESTY and
                STUPIDITY in regard to analysis of government data that has not been seen since before the 20th century.

                The number of Ukrainians that disappear is the order of 5-7 million, this is a census dip, an includes migration and prevented births. The population figures do attest to a tremendous amount of suffering, which is indicative
                of extreme economic hardship and famine, partly deliberately inflicted by Stalin’s policies.

                But DISHONEST IDIOTS take the process which eliminated 11 million kulaks and produced 10.5 million former-kulak collective farmers and state laborors, and call it the EXECUTION of 11 million kulaks. This is INTOLERABLE

                You are IGNORANT of the form of the Soviet economy. The farms were siezed and collectivized, and those peasants who could not make a living were driven to join the collective farms. The collectivization in the Ukraine
                produced collectivized farming and famine. What it did NOT produce is 11 million DEAD KULAKS. It produced 11 million FORMER KULAKS, some of whom died during the famine.
            </p>
            <p>
                The extent of all this is disputed, and one should actually do a survey of families to determine the extent of the famine. I urge you to start with yours. One should do this individually, because states can’t be trusted to
                do objective research. The size of the famine is roughly comparable to the Irish famine, where the family stories easily let you get an accurate estimate of the number of victims. You should see a large number of infant and
                elderly deaths in 1932-33, which will let you pinpoint the number of victims to within 10%. I’d guess 2-3 million people died in the famine, and that guess is better than the toilet paper estimates you get from so-called
                scholars today.

                That’s not the same thing as averaging the numbers published by Neo Nazis and Jews. Only one of those numbers is at all close to the truth, the truth is not an average of every opinion, but it doesn’t hurt to examine from

                The KULAKS were LIQUIDATED AS A CLASS by CONFISCATING THEIR PROPERTY and driven to join the collective farms, where they would be assigned jobs and given a wage. They often REFUSED to do this, and resisted the confiscation
                of their property with violent reprisals or by destroying their property before it could be confiscated. These might be natural reactions to confiscation, but that is what was going on— a large chunk of the nation was in
                revolt.

                The story you tell is IDIOTIC as usual. The farmer would not have thier farm coverted to a collective farm overnight, the land would be seized, the grain would be siezed, and collective farms would open up in separate places
                with separate people running them. The issue is that the landholders objected to the seizure, and the government collectively punished the region by withholding food aid. This is a form of collective punishment which can be
                classified as genocide, but you NEED TO KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING, and YOU CAN’T MAKE CRAP UP WILLY NILLY, LIKE YOU LIKE TO DO.

                The foreign press reports were all fabricated, journalists could not go there. These reports are stupid, they are long discredited, and they came from the Hearst yellow press which was MENTALLY RETARDED. Still, the fact that
                people are LYING, doesn’t mean that they get it WRONG. DESPITE THE LYING, THERE STILL WAS A FAMINE. But the Hearst press reports are not evidence, and the people reporting these things were just doing propaganda using other

                The best evidence is from your own family and that of others. You can examine the current age of Ukranians, to see the characteristic childhood mortality dip caused by a famine. You can ask people about lost children, lost
                farms, what happened in the year of the famine. When you do, you will get a reasonable estimate of the causalties— I estlmate they were roughly in the 2-3 million range, perhaps as high as 5 million, perhaps 7 million, but
                no more. They also have nothing to do with the Kulaks, who were shot in the hundreds of thousands, but make a relatively negligible contribution to the death toll. There was a smaller numbers of deaths outside the Ukraine
                due to the famine also, and there is dispute about whether the food relief efforts discriminated against the Ukraine.

                Those who were on collective farms did not starve, although they also suffered from the food shortages. You need to LEARN TO BE HONEST, and then ONE CAN DISCUSS. Until then, just shut up, because all you are doing is

                The census bureau in the 1930s was attacked politically, but THESE ARE NOT THE FIGURES ONE USES TO ESTIMATE THE FAMINE. You can easily estimate the famine deaths from polling families, YOU COULD DO IT TOO, IF YOU WEREN’T A
                DISHONEST FASCIST APOLOGIST. This is a simple way of estimating famine mortality, it works very well for the Irish famine after more than 150 years, it works very well for ALL FAMINES. The Famine in the USSR in 1932 was
                accompanied by food insecurity relief efforts which mitigated the death toll, and it was brief, as the 1933 harvest was abundant. The famine year might have claimed 6 million lives in the USSR, it is POSSIBLE, but it might
                have claimed 2 million lives, or 8 million lives, as it is difficult to estimate with dishonest CHARLATANS running about claiming numbers pulled out of their behinds as worthy of respect.

                The process of collectivization in the Ukraine was accompanied by confiscation of land, forcible removal of grain and seed stock, and the complete destruction of private farming, and the simultaneous introduction of
                intrinsically less efficient collective farming. This process is a terrible crime IN ITSELF, and the associated famine is A PREDICTABLE CONSEQUENCE today, after the experience of 1932 and the analogous experience in China in
                the 1960s, but it was not clear to communists steeped in 1930s propaganda. Collectivization leads to famine, it is well known today, it was simply not known in 1932.
            </p>
            <p>
                The death toll of the famine is by far the largest mortality associated with Stalin’s turn at the top. This famine mortality swamps all other mortalities from executions and labor mortality, which are estimated and compiled
                in serious journals by serious historians, and do not amount to a greater death toll than street homelessness does in the US. This IS NOT TO MINIMIZE EITHER DEMOCIDE, street homelessness is terrible, and the gulag was
                terrible, in roughly equal measure. The famine is something else altogether, because it meant food insecurity for enormous chunks of the entire Soviet Union, and it should have been a predictable consequence of the policy of
                collectivization, but it wasn’t predicted. Instead, these consequences were swept under the rug.
            </p>
            <p>
                The attribution of the famine deaths to Stalin is, in my opinion, justified, because of the political hiding of the famine. But it is ARGUABLE, because the collectivization was not a one-man job, it was supported by
                rank-and-file party members, and the famine was NOT DELIBERATE, it was due to THE USUAL COMMUNIST STUPIDITY, although the relief effort might have been selective in targeting the Ukraine. The famine has been OBSCENELY
                POLITICIZED and subject to MADE UP PROPAGANDA ESTIMATES, and there is no discussion with HISTORICAL FABRICATORS. Whether you are a socialist or a liberal, the only defence against darkness is telling the truth LOUDLY.
            </p>
            <p>
                The enormous numbers of deaths people claim under Stalin are INCOMPREHENSIBLY STUPID, EASILY REFUTED, REPREHENSIBLE LIES which have been studied and understood since the opening of the historical archives in the USSR in
                1989. I am not arguing with such stupidity, simply because I don’t need to— there are dozens of honest socialist and honest liberal web pages which describe the deaths in that period, as well as dozens of dishonest socialist
                and dishonest liberal web pages describing the same events. These are full of authoritative citations and figures, and it is extremely easy to see who is telling the truth when estimating the deaths.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those who make up large numbers conflate loss of property with loss of life. They turn every kulak who lost their land into a victim of homicide, and turn every imprisonment or demotion into a murder. But since their numbers
                are drawn from honest sources, it is very easy to see what is really going on by simply reinterpreting the same figures honestly. There were indeed about 20 million people demoted at some point in Stalin’s time, and if you
                consider getting fired from a nice position a type of victimization, then in some figurative sense, perhaps 20 million party members were victims. Stalin played musical chairs with the leadership of the party. But this is a
                TRAVESTY and a MOCKERY of the actual victims who were executed. The figures of 20 million dead, 60 million dead, or 110 million dead are simply incomprehensibly stupid laughable jokes, and deserve mention only as an example
                of how divorced from any notions of accuracy the liberal press has become in recent decades.

                The number of Stalin executions is in the .5-1.5 million range. The number of Stalin famine deaths is more uncertain, but it is most likely between 2 and 6 million, and that’s all USSR during 1932. That’s it. There’s nothing
                else. Everything else is STUPID LYING by people who don’t GIVE A CRAP ABOUT HISTORICAL ACCURACY, and POLLUTE THE LITERATURE WITH THEIR FARTS.

                I am aware of the lies of the communists, and I am also aware of the dishonesty and political pressure. What you are are not aware of is the complementary dishonesty on the other side, the liberal side. This dishonesty leads
                politicians to lie about statistics, as they are either too stupid, or figure the public is too stupid, to do accurate math.
            </p>
            <p>
                There simply were no 20 million dead under Stalin. I don’t have to be persuasive while I say it, because it is a simple and easily verified fact. You need to check case by case, and independent of BOTH the Soviets and the
                Liberals, because both of these devils lie.
            </p>
            <p>The way you verify this is to go up to a former Soviet resident, and ask them:</p>
            <p>“Who are your closest relatives killed by Stalin?”</p>
            <p>
                This is usually a statistical sample of ~50-100 persons, depending on how large the extended family is. You can know exactly how many are sampled by asking about the extent of the family knowledge. All you need are 10
                Russians and Ukrainians to get a reasonably accurate estimate.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the death rate is 60 million, you expect two grandmothers killed and a grandfather, a third to half the family wiped out in a conflagration analogous to a limited nuclear holocaust. For 20 million, you expect every family
                to have one grandfather dead, a mortality in the first 8 people alive in the era. If it’s 2 million, you expect a distant cousin to have been arrested, and to have heard about a distant second cousin who was executed or died
                of hunger. The last is the typical situation when interviewing Russians about personal family deaths, which are independent and not subject to manipulation by any authorities on either side.
            </p>
            <p>The order of magnitude points to order 10 million arrested and order 1 million killed, something which is already atrocious levels of state terror, which do not need exaggeration to be seen as terrible.</p>
            <p>
                Anything which is inconsistent with this order of magnitude is a lie. I don’t need anyone to confirm this, as I have actually talked to Russians and Ukrainians, asking this quesiton, while doing this statistical estimation
                in my head, and so can you.
            </p>
            <p>
                The famine deaths are a bit different, there were deaths by weakness and disease from the famine, mostly of young children, who tend to not get recorded in family oral history. These deaths perhaps amount to 5 million over
                the whole USSR, but perhaps 10 million also. The demographic dip for the USSR in the early 1930s is similar to the demographic dip in the US in the 1930s US (but much larger, perhaps about 20 million people). The US
                demographic dip claimed 5-10 million people demographically, although of course this simply all consists of postponed births, and these people reappear as the baby boom. You can’t say “Hoover and Roosevelt murdered 5 million
                Americans! Eisenhower miraculously resuscitates them.” because they didn’t and he didn’t.
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn’t read your links, because I have already concluded that you are a dishonest clown, and I ignore whatever you say. An honest person needs to sit down and do the survey I requested, which is easy for you, being
                Ukrainian— you already know the answer. It just isn’t the same as what you are doing propaganda for.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also cite no sources, and give no persuasive argument, nor direct evidence, I let people do their own research. It is true that there was bad political census data in Stalin’s time— it is also true that I shout and scream,
                and tell you inconsistent things. It doesn’t matter— I am honest globally, which is all that matters, and I did not deliberately misinform anyone of anything, unlike you. While I did know about the census attack in the
                1930s, I also know that it is easy to work around these kind of bad official numbers, because when the census bureau is attacked, it is only the global figures that need to be fudged. The local numbers are ok, for example,
                labor statistics for each city, and sampled birth and death records for each region. These are what are used by the honest historians to estimate the tolls from these tragedies, and these estimates are never sensationalist
                lying figures of 20 million or 60 million, but honest figures consistent with the sampling of family history.
            </p>
            <p>The family history, which is available to any interested person who knows some Russians and Ukrainians, just doesn’t care about the census takers, or about any officials at all.</p>

                What you are doing is only a game with authority, a game which simply does not work online, as it does in person or on TV (it’s surprising, I know, but it’s true). I verified the assertions I am making with excellent
                confidence a long time ago, anyone can check that the numbers people give here are made up, therefore I don’t need to do anything except shout.

                The internet is rude for a reason, it is rude so that you can’t do propaganda without getting insulted. The insults are healthy to the extent that they prevent formation and concentrations of authority, and they work. People
                online have zero authority, and an authority free open discussion leads to truth very quickly becoming self-evident.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our comment discussion is an example. I think anyone reviewing the discussion has a much greater chance of getting an accurate historical picture than if this person watched all the documentaries on the subject on TV. The
                discussion itself is useless, it is simply a handle for people to search for related academic materials and read them. Hostile discussions lead to accuracy, because people are given a stark choice between different bony
                skeletons upon which they can hang the facts they find online. The facts they find independently quickly make it clear which skeleton is more accurate.
            </p>
            <p>But propaganda tries to disallow certain things from getting said, especially rude things, because rudeness kills propaganda dead. So you get an elephant man version of the truth.</p>

                Online hostility can lead to some personal nuisances sometimes, the author of the article did feel psychologically threatened because someone posted her home address. That’s unfortunate, it shouldn’t have happened, but it
                isn’t particularly terrible. She should know better than to think that a flame war is a motive for violence, and she shouldn’t call the flame war “death threats”, and she should make insinuations that her children were
                threatened, because her adult children were not threatened (and neither was she threatened in any credible way).
            </p>
            <p>
                The internet produces a nearly insuperable barrier between speech and violence, so the discussions can be free to be vicious. Vicious discussions immediately neutralize propaganda from any side, whether the propaganda is for
                accurate or inaccurate viewpoints.

                All it takes is one person saying “boo hoo” for a sob story to be neutralized. All it takes is one person calling you names for consensus to disappear momentarily. The way to verify the truth of assertions is to research
                them using neutral scholarly sources, and this doesn’t happen unless people see an irreconcilable conflict.

                You have not changed my mind regarding anything, I am inconsistent simply because I am going by hazy memory, I forgot about the census fiasco of 1939, but you are right about that— there was a censored census, I do remember.
                You are seeing contradictions, because you don’t understand how official lying works— there are figures for export, and figures used internally, and since 1989, we have had access to all the archives, and we can study them
                all and get a good picture. But that’s not what happened, instead, the honest stuff has been suppressed, and dishonest lies have been promoted. You are promoting the lies.
            </p>
            <p>
                My sources were never the Soviet census of 1939, I vaguely remember that, but it is usual lying nonsense. I never cited any sources at all for my claims, I don’t need to, as I expect the reader to dig for themselves. But if
                you want the personal story, I personally read many of the discussions about the famine in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the Soviet archives were opened, and I went into great detail, including poring over whatever
                published statistics I could find, because I was curious about how Soviet communism could even function. I didn’t understand how you could run an entire economy from the top down. I got a reasonable picture of all the
                relevant events, but I was 16 years old, and it was a long time ago. I am not going to repeat the effort, because there has been no new discoveries, all that has happened is that more and more vile propaganda has
                progressively replaced the honest (negative) assessments of the early 1990s.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know the rough magnitude of the 1932 famine, it was pretty large as far as famines go. But a famine with 5 million death toll in a single year is an ENORMOUS famine, it is STUPENDOUS. It would leave a generational memory,
                it is not a small thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The famine was acknowledged to be large internally relatively honestly from Khruschev’s time onwards. The census data you find in the 1950s are accurate and reliable, and generally the post-Stalin Soviet figures are very
                good. The global 1939 population census figures were lies, and these are not the “honest and reliable” figures I was talking about. The honest and reliable figures in that era are not global, but local statistics for labor
                and population, year of birth, year of death, which you can find in the Soviet archives and which allow historians to piece together a picture of the arrests and the famine.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other source I used is randomly polled Russians and Ukrainians, just as a sanity check, to make sure I wasn’t missing a holocaust. I did the same sanity check with European jews, to make sure that I wasn’t inventing a
                holocaust. This is very easy to do personally, so you get a picture of the events without any reliance on anyone else. This is an important sanity check, a sanity check you didn’t do, you lying little Eichmann.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is one extremely notable person who reports a very high famine mortality in his village, that is Gorbachev. He claims 4 immediate relative dying, children and old folks all over his village, as is typical of a famine,
                he is telling the truth. The claim for a 40% mortality in his village is very credible, and there is no reason to dispute it, and I don’t.
            </p>
            <p>
                The famine was a serious thing, affecting large regions of the country, and there were places where the mortality was enormous. But there are also places with very few famine mortalities, like the big cities, or certain
                villages, because relief efforts or hidden sources of grain mitigated the starvation. You need a random sample of people to know what the extent of the famine was, so that you can estimate the number of victims properly.
                Taking one person among the worst affected and making them statistically representative is what you are doing. In order for the figures you claim are correct to actually be correct, Gorbachev’s experience would have to be
                typical. It is not, Gorbachev experience reflects that of a minority of about 10%. That makes number of famine victims is surely quite large— on the order of 2-5 million people, perhaps more, perhaps 10 million, perhaps even
                more 4% of the USSR population is 6.4 million people, that’s a reasonable estimate. I personally don’t know the precise figures, and it is difficult to estimate, because unlike political repression, the victims are generally
                invisible— infants and the elderly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 1932-33 famine is by far the largest mortality associated with Stalin. It does not come anywhere near the claims of 20 million deaths or 60 million deaths, and it has nothing to do with political executions. The number
                of political executions is of the order of 1 million people. The remaining mortality is all famine deaths in one year, 1932-33, and these deaths were localized, and did not constitute direct repression, rather the usual
                indirect production and distribution stupidities of communism. You simply don’t know how to think, so you conflate these in the same way other propagandists do.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Soviet figures were honest and reliable regarding their internal labor statistics, internal births and deaths. The Soviet Union in the years after Stalin was generally pretty honest about Stalin’s crimes, with some
                politically inexpedient exceptions like the Katyn massacre.
            </p>
            <p>But I am talking to a buffoon, who does not understand subtlety, so it is better to just say “The Soviets were honest and reliable”.</p>

            <p>
                The year starting from the bad 1932 harvest and ending with the good 1933 harvest is the singular year of Stalin’s famine. It does not comprise a single calendar year, since harvests don’t come in January. There was some
                food insecurity later too, the collective farming was not very good.

                Rudeness works as propaganda only when it is restricted to come from one side. It works as counterpropaganda when it comes from both sides equally, and when there are two equally vicious sides, people look at the evidence.

            <p>
                I don’t deny the Ukrainian famine. I am telling you what it was. It was a collectivization of farming and the associated collectivization famine, which occurs again in every involuntary collectivization effort in
                agriculture. It is a genocide in the same sense as the Irish famine was a genocide. I would argue that both are genocides broadly speaking. The collectivization and collective measures which led to starvation was bad enough
                as it was.

                But all the discussions regarding the number of Stalin’s victims are straight up lies, taking victims of famine, and turning them into victims of political execution. and one must be rude and spit on the graves of millions
                of actually suffering people to correct this.

                The extent of the 1932-33 famine is difficult to judge, but the number of non-famine victims of Stalin is of order 1 million people, and the number of famine victims has been played with politically. The best estimate I
                would make personally is 5 million famine victims over all the USSR, mostly children and the elderly, which is a pretty catastrophic famine, and is consistent with the reminiscences of people I have read from the era. The
                1932 famine is the worst death toll associated with Stalin, and it is not political repression exactly, but collectivized agriculture. Mao’s collectivization program led to a worse famine.

                I want a discussion full of insults, but no death threats. The death threats are a one-in-a-million occurence, and one does not need to censor 999,999 hostile comments to get rid of one inappropriate, but empty, threat.

            <p>The basis for asserting that she got nothing else: she never says she got anything else. She didn’t get anything else, and that’s just a fact. She makes it sound as if she did, using indirection and propaganda.</p>

                The details of the collectivization famine in the USSR: there was a smaller Khazakstan famine in 1931 in the pilot collectivization program, and then a terrible all-USSR famine, worst in the Ukraine in 1932 and surrounding
                regions, which is the one that claimed millions of victims.
            </p>
            <p>
                The bad harvests were all the initial collectivized harvests, as collective farms are intrinsically less efficient than small plots, and further, the new labor on these farms was inexperienced in collective farming and run
                incompetently. The famine ended with the first good harvests of 1933. During that year, the mortality was atrocious.

                It doesn’t kill it, it is simply tempering an odious idea with the facade of moderation. The hostile discussions are a form of peer review, they prevent the accumulation of authority and the stifling of unpopular opinions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The linking of internet hostility to violence is a false association designed to prevent hostile and rude internet peer review from working, by requiring niceness. There is no nice way to say “you are full of crap”, and
                there is no threat of violence in that.

                The problem with internet comment moderation is that it enforces the point of view of the moderator, except in cases where the moderator takes special effort to be open to all positions. The role of the internet is to allow
                the creative destruction of bad ideas, and this process is extremely rude, but must be allowed to function.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the real world, moderation powers are used to suppress dissent much more often than they are used to get rid of threats. The simple fact is that threats hardly ever come, and when they do, they can be handled simply by
                usual methods, as they are abberations. One of the nice things online is that there is a nearly insuperable barrier to violence, which protects opinions from retribution.

                The open discussion is more valuable if it is let alone. That doesn’t mean that every comment needs to be preserved, but comments which are long, which are thought out, which have nontrivial statements (including rude ones)
                are important, because they show disagreement. The rudeness is the most important feature, as it leads to accuracy over time, even in competely uncensored places, like youtube comments, you can find nontrivial discussions
                which converge on unpopular truths, so long as the discussion is both rude, and focused.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal for me is preserving rude focused honest discussion. Any attack on rudeness is ultimately an attack on honesty, even if it is tempered with moderation and sounds reasonable. Censorship always sounds reasonable, and
                it hardly ever is.

                I see you are rude and obnoxious, all right! Good job. I therefore agree to defer to your judgement, and accept everything you say without reservation, so long as it is exactly your interpretation, and not someone else. It
                would be just peachy if you were in charge of the decisions on who to ban and who to block, and what to delete.
            </p>
            <p>But you’re not really in charge, and there is subtext in this article you are blind to, which is contradicting the direct statement you quote (I agree with the direct statement).</p>
            <p>
                Still, whatever, that’s ok. You are an asshole too, so I am on your side. I agree with all the negative things you have to say about me, so long as you are willing to consistently defend hostile and insulting tone like the
                one you used, no matter in which direction the insults are going.
            </p>
            <p>
                The people who argue for moderation want to get rid of insults in one direction only, the insults going from the powerless to the powerful. Insults from the powerful to the powerless are usually subtle, and invisible to
                everyone except those they are insulting.
