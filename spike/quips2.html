<span><div><div>I've been lurking this thread since yesterday so I might as well chime in. Anki is a fucking superpower. Spaced repetition is like alien secret technology and humanity doesn't deserve it. I personally went from being an average student at university to an academic superstar overnight. It was amazing. The funny part is the dejected looks on my peers' faces whelst during class I know all the answers and on the exams I score near perfectly. Even on the tricky stuff, since I've filled my skull with all manner of memorable insight and I've made flashcards from every angle of a subject.</div><div>The most devastating technique I discovered was this, and listen closely /sci/lets cuz you only get one.</div><div>Download your textbook from libgen, if it's maths, get the solutions manual too. Open the pdf in GIMP. This will make a layer for every page. Reflect on this point. As you normally go through the typically poorly written tome, you notice how often something will be covered earlier in the book yet not properly explained until later. But by the time you get to the later part, you've forgotten the earlier part exists or it isn't fresh so you don't get the proper insight. With GIMP, as you go through the book making your cards, you delete passages and pages. Yet you leave behind the parts that either aren't explained well or you just don't *get*. After you've finished the book, Go through for a second run starting at the beginning. There'll be much less material but you'll have the proper context to understand what you skipped over earlier. With this technique, you will be a GOD. Nothing beyond your grasp no matter how recondite.

And coupled with its intense contrarianism found its way into being taken seriously by both major news networks and crackpot lunatics alike. As anyone could have told you. It's very entertaining when your half hearted toilet posting ends up on the front page of a news site. But that draws a crowd, and now /pol/ is what it is.</div><div>I barely visit any more. Threads move too quickly, and what was once a place where I could argue, half in jest, with some guy in Brazil about circumcision and religion has become an incomprehensible cesspool of memes. It's a trash hobby, but I also think /pol/ is, and has been, one of the most entertaining public forums in the world. No where else can you have discussions like /pol/. As absurd as they are. The crossfire of shit posts, legitimate insanity, self righteous people legitimately trying to attack it, and the trolls trolling trolls for hundreds of replies. It is completely impossible to tell the reasoning or mind of any given poster.</div><div>That said it's lost a lot of its charm for me. It's overwhelming. A slightly younger /pol/ would probably be praising this fake-mail-bomber as their guy, and trying to mine as much salt and humor out of it as they could, but now there are thread after thread of why it's a false flag, and how he doesn't actually like Trump and downplaying it instead of embracing it. Just disappointing. Because now it looks like /pol/ actually cares. And that's not cool.</div><div>anyway 4chan sucks.

The research is as follows. Pocket-protected scientists built a wall of iron and crashed a diamond car into it at 400 miles per hour, and the car was unharmed. They then built a wall out of diamond and crashed a car made of iron moving at 400 miles an hour into the wall, and the wall came out fine. They then crashed a diamond car made of 400 miles per hour into a wall, and there were no survivors. They crashed 400 miles per hour into a diamond traveling at iron car. Western New York was powerless for hours. They rammed a wall of metal into a 400 mile per hour made of diamond, and the resulting explosion shifted the earth's orbit 400 million miles away from the sun, saving the earth from a meteor the size of a small Washington suburb that was hurtling towards mid-western Prussia at 400 billion miles per hour. They shot a diamond made of iron at a car moving at 400 walls per hour, and as a result caused two wayward airplanes to lose track of their bearings, and make a fatal crash with two buildings in downtown New York. They spun 400 miles at diamond into iron per wall. The results were inconclusive. Finally, they placed 400 diamonds per hour in front of a car made of wall traveling at miles per iron, and the result proved without a doubt that diamonds were the hardest metal of all time, if not just the hardest metal known to man.</div><hr/><div>One evening, with his charge at full capacity, Micro Farad decided to get a cute coil to discharge him. He went to the Magnet Bar to pick up a chip called Millie Amp. He caught her out back trying self induction; fortunately, she had not damaged her solenoid. The two took off on his megacycle and rode across the Wheatstone Bridge into a magnetic field, next to a flowing current , to watch the sine waves.</div><div>Micro Farad was very much stimulated by Millie's characteristic curve. Being attractive himself, he soon had her field fully excited. He set her on the ground potential, raised his frequency, lowered her resistance, and pulled out his high voltage probe. When he inserted it in parallel, he short-circuited her shunt. Fully excited, Millie cried out, &quot;ohm, ohm, give me mho&quot;. As he increased his tube to maximum output, her coil vibrated from the current flow. It did not take long for her shunt to reach maximum heat. Now with the excessive current shortening her shunt, Micro's capacity rapidly discharged – every electron was drained off. But that was not the end of it. Indeed, they fluxed all night, tried various connections and hookings until his bar magnet weakened, and he could no longer generate enough voltage to sustain his collapsing field. With his battery fully discharged, Micro was unable to excite his tickler, so they went home. A few weeks later, they were merged forever and oscillated happily ever after.</div><div>I fucking love science.

I was a fan of his /sci/ threads and I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.</div><div>He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”</div><div>I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.</div><div>The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.</div><div>When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.</div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Testing : GREENTEXT</span></div><hr/><div>&gt;professor asks for answer</div><div>&gt;pull out solutions manual and give correct answer as a goof</div><div>&gt;professor guffaws</div><div>&gt;class erupts in laughter</div><div>&gt;professor cracking up so hard that he's slapping the board and can't breath</div><div>&gt;have to cancel class</div><div>&gt;gives me 5% extra credit next lecture</div><div>This is literally how things go for non autists.
