<h2><strong>Masters of the Land: Native Ship and Canal Building During the Spanish-Aztec War</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
“Masters of the Land: Native Ship and Canal Building During the Spanish-Aztec War”</p>
<p>In February 1521, a caravan so grand<br />
Of some 30,000 Native folk convened upon the land<br />
In Tlaxcala’s great province for a mission most supreme.<br />
(They marched across the forests and the mountains like a team.)<br />
For <strong>four days</strong>, onward pressed they all, until at Tetzcoco’s shore<br />
They arrived in late February, fulfilling what they bore.<br />
The artificial waterway, complete by spring that year—<br />
1521—would see warships soon appear.<br />
Thus these vessels, once constructed, stood ready to deploy<br />
In the final siege of Tenochtitlan, a fearsome ploy.</p>
<p>Although the brigantines have glowed in conquest lore,<br />
(From “Spanish-Aztec War (1591–21),” though that may be a typographic score),<br />
Their building and the canal essential to the plan<br />
Are seldom dwelled upon by histories’ scanning span.<br />
Likewise, the naval program’s rarely told in thorough style,<br />
And the major role of Natives seldom features in the file.</p>
<p>Earliest sources from the conquest, authored by the foes—<br />
The invaders—paid it little heed in what their text bestows.<br />
The two conquistador-authors (Cortés and Bernal Díaz)<br />
Were absent from the building site (so meager are ideas).<br />
Sparse documentation’s left this story mostly glossed,<br />
For four more centuries it stayed obscure, as though ’twere lost,<br />
Till twentieth-century days, when <strong>C. Harvey Gardiner</strong> made<br />
A thorough early chronicle from notes that had been laid<br />
By the master shipwright, Martín López, in archives old.<br />
That gave the first detailed account of what had once been told.</p>
<p>In centering the Natives in this naval enterprise,<br />
This article aligns with “New Conquest History” (it implies).<br />
Among the trending themes is how Indigenous allies<br />
Extended Spanish power so their empire soon would rise.<br />
For instance, <strong>Camilla Townsend</strong> wrote of Cortés’s dear Marina,<br />
Who as Malintzin or Malinche changed the War’s arena,<br />
Serving as translator, strategist, and ally close at hand—<br />
A vital presence bridging two worlds none could understand.<br />
Then <strong>Laura Matthew</strong> and Michel Oudijk, in a volume edited,<br />
Explored how many Native folks (some soldiers, some credited<br />
As non-combatants) aided conquests in Mesoamerican war,<br />
And so this piece continues that tradition, digging more<br />
Into the vital ways these local people gave their skill,<br />
As porters, artisans, or spies who roamed beyond each hill,<br />
As guides or cooks or translators, or warriors in a fight,<br />
Who shaped the lengthy naval plan and helped it to ignite.</p>
<p>A crucial aspect of this enterprise that soared<br />
Was more than just their labor; it was knowledge they outpoured.<br />
For millennia, the Basin of Mexico’s folks had learned<br />
To harness land and water with a wisdom they had earned.<br />
From building dams and aqueducts to bridging watery bounds,<br />
Their feats of engineering thrived across their native grounds.<br />
When the naval program started (1520, by that date),<br />
Their hydrological brilliance steered the building’s fate,<br />
Ensuring that the warships and the canal, too, would succeed,<br />
A testament to knowledge that the Natives chose to lead.</p>
<p>Such emphasis on Native skill stands stark against the style<br />
Of older Atlantic histories that scorned them all the while.<br />
Europe was deemed the center of invention and of grace,<br />
With “knowledge” said to travel outward from that single place.<br />
But now, this article upholds that viewpoint’s inexact,<br />
Expanding on new scholarship to highlight as a fact<br />
That Indigenous epistemologies, in sciences applied,<br />
Proved indispensable, ensuring that their know-how could preside.<br />
Thus the amphibious project, shaped by local ways and gear,<br />
Displayed how knowledge synergy would banish doubt and fear.</p>
<p>The enterprise demanded many raw supplies be won,<br />
With timber as essential as the sky requires the sun.<br />
For cotton and for pitch to caulk the hulls in proper mode,<br />
They’d also gather stone, to shore canal walls where they flowed,<br />
And water sources close at hand to fill the channel’s bed.<br />
Yet seldom do war histories speak of what environment bred—<br />
How lakes or soils, or precipitation shaped each plan,<br />
Or how these forces might have swayed the conquest of the land.<br />
<strong>J. R. McNeill</strong> in <em>Mosquito Empires</em> showed across the seas<br />
How insects bearing fevers vexed imperialities.<br />
They stymied Dutch or British, then the French Napoleons,<br />
But Mexico’s lake system, though perhaps a lesser scion<br />
Of natural menace, also bore formidable might:<br />
It ringed Tenochtitlan so the city stayed in sight<br />
But rarely was accessible for conquering armies bold.<br />
Thus warships turned essential, or so we now are told.</p>
<p>Hence <strong>timber</strong> served as crucial as a horse or sword or gun,<br />
And proved a raw material that shaped how conquest’s done.<br />
The environment, indeed—these lakes, these trees, this soil—<br />
Influenced war decisions, planning, vantage, strife, and toil.<br />
Not saying that environment alone would pick who’d win,<br />
But humans (Natives) knew that synergy, and thus dug in,<br />
Deploying their domain-savvy to harness local ground,<br />
To shape the war and tilt events where victory might be found.</p>
<p>To reassemble Natives’ role in this aquatic scheme,<br />
We rummage through the Spanish and Indigenous source stream.<br />
Published glimpses lie in writings from Cortés and Diaz,<br />
And in old colonial histories from Salazar or peers—<br />
Francisco Cervantes de Salazar, plus Torquemada, too,<br />
And the two Native historians: Chimalpahin’s view,<br />
With Alva Ixtlilxochitl—both letting us behold<br />
Those big events: from timber haul to how the ships took hold.<br />
Their texts reveal the major feats in building all the boats,<br />
They mention canal excavation, with minor anecdote notes,<br />
But also they highlight Natives’ share in fueling that campaign,<br />
Which thus expands our vantage on how the war was gained.</p>
<p>More <strong>archival sources</strong> from the early sixteenth tide<br />
Help buttress or confirm these threads so data can abide.<br />
One prime example: the “Interrogatorio” of 1565,<br />
Compiled by people in Tlaxcala who set forth to contrive<br />
A sworn deposition recollecting conquest’s day.<br />
Though done four decades after all, with biases at play—<br />
The elderly Spaniards, all aligned with Tlaxcalteca side,<br />
The questions only asked of them and no one else beside—<br />
It still grants us a window on canal and ship design.<br />
Some details nowhere else appear, so we read between the line:<br />
We weigh these testimonies with Bernal Diaz, or the voice<br />
Of Cortés, or Alva Ixtlilxochitl, so we can rejoice<br />
In how the data overlap or differ, searching for the truth,<br />
Which, read together, yields a storyline that’s couth.<br />
Thus the Natives’ role emerges with dimension that is new,<br />
But first, we must contextualize how Spain’s incursion grew.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2><strong>For Glory and Riches: The Spanish Invasion of Central Mexico</strong></h2>
<p>On February 10 of 1519, with bold soul,<br />
Hernando Cortés left Cuba’s shores in search of his new goal.<br />
He bore eleven ships, a band of men (five hundred strong),<br />
Sixteen horses, pressing forward, sense of conquest running long.<br />
The governor of Cuba, <strong>Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar</strong>,<br />
Had told him not to conquer, only trade, observe afar.<br />
Whether Cortés intended to obey is up for guess;<br />
In any case, he soon rebelled, propelled by lust for success.<br />
He heard of Tenochtitlan’s wealth, that city in the Vale,<br />
A seat of Aztec might and gold that beckoned to regale.<br />
He pressed inland with his retinue (some loyal, some annoyed)<br />
And garnered help from states oppressed or thoroughly deployed<br />
As tributaries to the Mexica or Aztec domain.<br />
These local foes of Tenochtitlan joined up, their wrath made plain.<br />
Thus Spanish plus the Natives marched, approaching that proud seat,<br />
Arriving in November 1519’s beat.<br />
The Aztec emperor (huey tlahtoani) known as <strong>Montezuma</strong>,<br />
Faced these strangers—did he fight them or else greet them in a puma’s<br />
Ferocious style? Instead he welcomed them inside,<br />
A puzzling step that historians to this day still can’t abide.</p>
<p>The Spanish occupation soon proved tense: a deadly fuss,<br />
As Tenochtitlan’s folk or their allies caused a plus<br />
Of friction, culminating in departure under stress.<br />
By July 1520, the Spaniards’ power was less.<br />
They limped to refuge in Tlaxcala, nursing all their wounded men,<br />
They took some months to gather strength and plan their push again.<br />
No cavalry could function well on Tenochtitlan’s causeways,<br />
And Mexica canoes reigned supreme if water played a phase.<br />
So how to conquer that aquatic fortress ringed by lake?<br />
<strong>Control the water</strong> was the key, to edge out the Aztec stake.<br />
In September 1520, Cortés told shipwright López wise<br />
To build a naval squadron to secure the watery prize.<br />
Meanwhile, the rest prepared for siege with stockpiled goods in store,<br />
Eliminating threats around the Valley all the more.</p>
<p>By April 28, in 1521’s new spring sun,<br />
A mass of Spanish-Indigenous allies had begun<br />
Their final gather at Lake Texcoco, launching the assault.<br />
Three months of savage siege ensued, and in the final vault,<br />
By August 13, Tenochtitlan fell, its might undone.<br />
While many pages have been penned about those battles spun,<br />
This article instead will show the stepping stones required<br />
Between autumn 1520 and spring’s date so oft admired,<br />
When ships, canal, and all the rest were shaped by Native hands—<br />
An epic feat that shaped the war and redefined these lands.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2><strong>Into the Forests of Tlaxcala: Fell the Timbers, Fashion the Planks</strong></h2>
<p>At least formally, it all began in <strong>September 1520</strong>’s day,<br />
When Cortés told <strong>Martín López</strong>: “To Tlaxcala, on your way—<br />
Collect the timber for these ships we’ll haul across the plain!”<br />
Though daring was the notion, it did <strong>not</strong> spring from Cortés’s brain.<br />
In <strong>1502</strong>, the “Gran Capitán,” Gonzalo so renowned—<br />
Fernández de Córdoba—had used such tactics once, we’ve found,<br />
Attacking Italy’s Taranto, a lakeside city fair,<br />
Reminiscent of Tenochtitlan’s watery thoroughfare.</p>
<p>When Martín López made his way to Tlaxcala’s domain,<br />
In late September, local folk escorted him with train<br />
Into the wooded forests on Matlalcueitl’s slope,<br />
(We call that La Malinche now) for trees that gave them hope.<br />
For centuries, inhabitants had cultivated there:<br />
<strong>Oak, evergreen oak, and pine</strong>—wood strong beyond compare.<br />
Once sawed and trimmed, these timbers left the forest-laden glade,<br />
Shouldered by <strong>Indigenous tameme</strong>, in a mighty masquerade,<br />
Who bore them out to <strong>Río Zahuapan</strong> near Tlaxcala’s place,<br />
Upstream from the city walls, they marched at steady pace.<br />
Their presence proves that from the start, these Native aides so strong<br />
Were pivotal and central, making Spanish labor long<br />
Less burdensome, for truly, they supplied the muscle core,<br />
Executing backbreaking tasks and hefting timbers o’er.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as timber took shape in Tlaxcala’s busy hum,<br />
Cortés dispatched some Spaniards to <strong>Veracruz</strong> to come<br />
And fetch important gear he’d seized before from ships he’d burned,<br />
When he scuttled his own vessels so that none of them returned<br />
To Cuba with Velázquez’s men. Their sails, nails, rigging, all<br />
Lay waiting off in Veracruz, he’d need them for this call.<br />
At some time in <strong>December 1520</strong>, Cortés made it plain:<br />
“Retrieve those maritime supplies and haul them back again.”</p>
<p>Because it was the winter, dryness shrank the Zahuapan flow,<br />
So brigantines could scarcely float along its shallow row.<br />
They had to build a dam of earth, to raise the water’s height—<br />
<strong>Gardiner</strong> notes they did this near Tizatlán, out of sight,<br />
A small community upstream, with López in command,<br />
Directing how that water blockade flooded all the land.<br />
In sum, the dam worked perfectly: the river’s depth now soared,<br />
So nearly flat-bottomed hulls (two feet or so aboard)<br />
Could sail without a snag or hitch. Once tested and passed muster,<br />
They were dismantled, bound for land, in quiet, careful cluster,<br />
Prepared to trek to Tetzcoco, their new Spanish HQ base.<br />
(See <strong>Figure 3</strong> in references for glimpses of that space.)</p>
<p>Why Tetzcoco got selected is not spelled out crystal clear,<br />
But likely they preferred a lakeside vantage point so near<br />
That they could strike by land and water, starve Tenochtitlan well.<br />
And Tetzcoco, in the eastern shore’s domain, was large to dwell,<br />
Could house supplies, feed Spanish troops for months of preparation.<br />
It also lay more distant from the Aztec stronghold station<br />
Than western or southern lakeside towns, a buffer safe enough—<br />
A vantage for a shipyard where the Mexica’s raids were tough.<br />
Indeed, the Mexica tried to burn these hulls in brazen ploys;<br />
By building well inland, the Spanish thwarted savage noise.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2><strong>The Tetzcoco Shipyard: Carry the Crafts, Assemble the Ships</strong></h2>
<p>With winter’s end approaching, the first phase nearly done—<br />
For <strong>five months</strong>, Native workers plus the Spaniards strove as one,<br />
Ensuring all the lumber had been marked, cut, sized, and shaped,<br />
A tedious labor, but the greatest challenge still escaped:<br />
They must haul prefab vessels from Tlaxcala’s forest glen<br />
To Tetzcoco, and with canal-dig, outdo their mortal ken.<br />
This might have been the greatest feat in that entire fight,<br />
Or so the chroniclers attest, for sure it was no slight.</p>
<p>When February (1521) time arrived to move the crafts,<br />
At least <strong>8,000</strong> Native <strong>tameme</strong> from local staffs—<br />
<strong>Tlaxcala, Huejotzingo, Cholula</strong>—raised the logs,<br />
The ironwork, sails, anchors, rigging for these water dogs.<br />
Another <strong>2,000</strong> Native folks lugged foodstuffs, so the train<br />
Could feed that giant caravan crossing hill and plain.<br />
And then a force of <strong>20,000</strong> local fighting men<br />
From Tlaxcala’s prime warriors secured them in their den.<br />
In total, over <strong>30,000</strong> souls advanced in columns grand,<br />
A line that stretched six miles or more to Tetzcoco’s demand.</p>
<p>They crossed the boundary of Tetzcoco; the company so grand<br />
Paraded through the city in a brilliant, festive stand.<br />
Díaz del Castillo watched the <strong>Tlaxcalteca</strong> arrive:<br />
With drum and trumpet echoing, their ranks appeared alive,<br />
Dressed in finest panoply, half a day to funnel in,<br />
Shouting “Viva! Castile and Tlaxcala!” midst the din.<br />
Cortés himself reports the convoy took another six more hours<br />
Before the rear had reached the front and joined the base’s powers.</p>
<p>In <strong>Figure 5</strong>, you’ll note that Natives outnumber Spaniards four to one,<br />
They’re central to the image, each with hatchet shining sun.<br />
Though not an exact ratio, it clarifies the role:<br />
Indigenous shipyard workers formed the project’s vital soul.<br />
They stood there in the center as the focus of the frame,<br />
Suggesting they were paramount to how these ships became<br />
A fleeting dream to actual hulls. At least that’s how the scribe<br />
Or artist saw their central place, that core of labor’s vibe.</p>
<p>As building neared completion, local products held the key,<br />
Like pitch, the sticky substance used to waterproof at sea,<br />
And cotton, needed swiftly in sufficient, vast supply.<br />
The Natives’ knowledge of trade routes let them quickly buy<br />
The fiber from Mesoamerican provinces galore,<br />
Ensuring that no time was lost, that all progressed once more.<br />
Thus Native skill in gathering goods sped up the project pace,<br />
So nothing halted their timeline or caused a snail’s slow race.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2><strong>Excavate the Canal</strong></h2>
<p>While ships were being built, another plan took shape apace:<br />
They <strong>dug a 9,100-foot canal</strong>, requiring grace,<br />
So these landlocked hulls could float on out to Lake Texcoco’s tide.<br />
<strong>Ixtlilxochitl</strong>, Tetzcoco’s lord, served as the project guide<br />
(See <strong>Figure 6</strong> for context). Allied with Cortés, he stood<br />
As leader of the effort in his Tetzcocan neighborhood.<br />
We find no Spaniard claiming they performed the engineering—<br />
All signs suggest the Tetzcocans did the planning and the steering.<br />
They likely chose the route, oversaw the excavation’s might,<br />
Directed how to line the walls, ensuring all was tight.<br />
Their region excelled in waterworks, from dikes to causeways set,<br />
Aqueducts and sluice gates soared in fifteenth-century net.<br />
Hence building such a channel was no puzzling ask at all—<br />
They knew the lake-laced terrain by heart, no challenge to enthrall.</p>
<p>First, they had to pick a place. That might have come to mind<br />
By analyzing slopes and soils of a certain kind.<br />
They had to <strong>deepen</strong> stream beds to create a path for ships,<br />
But lumps of rock and stone would hamper any digging trips.<br />
They couldn’t just go round them all, they’d haul them out or bust<br />
Them into smaller pieces with picks or mallets’ thrust.<br />
Considering the length (9,100 feet) they had to clear,<br />
The job loomed monstrous—any digger must have quaked in fear.</p>
<p><strong>Labor</strong>-wise, the daily shifts of <strong>8,000–10,000 men</strong><br />
(For fifty days straight) accomplished wonders time and again.<br />
But we shouldn’t hail Ixtlilxochitl alone with praise so strong,<br />
He ruled the province broadly, and he couldn’t stay too long<br />
In one place, so local overseers took up the daily chore,<br />
Communicating methods from the canal’s side or floor,<br />
While diggers toiled to shift the earth, aware their time was short,<br />
Each one compelled to finish fast, for war was at the port.<br />
Thus the entire process was collaborative in style,<br />
With <strong>tlahtoani,</strong> foremen, laborers in lines for many a mile.</p>
<p>Their feats were not just digging: all that soil had to go<br />
Somewhere, forming embankments to keep water in the flow.<br />
Plus stakes and stones to line the canal, so watery seepage<br />
Wouldn’t drain away. The Natives had the knowledge to engage<br />
Such tasks, from centuries controlling lake and watery land.<br />
Spaniards, from drier provinces, might not quite understand.</p>
<p>Nor was it only diggers: interpretive tasks were due,<br />
Translators bridging Spanish tongues with local workers too,<br />
And <strong>cooks</strong> who’d feed the 8,000–10,000 daily crews,<br />
(Quite often that involved Indigenous women who paid their dues.)<br />
Malintzin might have stepped in so instructions made it through:<br />
How planks fit, how guns got mounted, what each worker had to do.<br />
<strong>Native combatants</strong> also helped repel Mexica raids,<br />
Preventing sabotage by foes in cunning escapades.<br />
Without them, ships might well be burned, the schedule cast astray,<br />
Yet in the end, by late April 1521, all was okay.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2><strong>Into the Lake: Release the Dams, Launch the Ships</strong></h2>
<p>With brigantines completed, and the canal carved deep,<br />
They faced one final puzzle: how to <strong>raise the water’s heap</strong>?<br />
In April’s dryness, rivers shrink, so shallow flows remain.<br />
To float those hulls the distance, they required a watery gain.<br />
Thus they erected dams—<strong>12 total</strong>—in strategic spots along<br />
The 1.73-mile channel, a watery throng.<br />
Releasing them in sequence forced a sudden rushing tide,<br />
Which raised the canal’s water height so vessels could then glide<br />
Toward Lake Texcoco’s open realm. Tetzcocans knew the scene,<br />
In building such embankments they excelled, keen and serene,<br />
Having grown around these lacustrine pockets all their lives,<br />
While Spaniards, fewer in number, busied themselves and thrived<br />
On other siege preparations. So Tetzcocans oversaw<br />
The dam construction, harnessing the watery land by law.</p>
<p>When those 12 embankments stood, they tethered ships in place,<br />
Then opened each dam’s barrier, unleashing speed apace.<br />
Cervantes de Salazar records how tricky was the throw:<br />
They feared the current’s fury might dash hulls below<br />
Or cause them to collide. If any brigantine should crack,<br />
They’d spent eight months for nothing, halting conquest in its track.<br />
Hence on <strong>April 28</strong>, the watchers gathered ’round,<br />
Spanish and Natives alike, on lakeshore’s edge of ground.<br />
They prayed and said a mass, Friar Olmedo came to bless<br />
Each ship with holy water, asking Mary for success.<br />
When signaled to release the dam, the vessels roared in might,<br />
Using some “inventions” to ensure they stayed upright,<br />
They dropped into the canal in turn and glided to the lake,<br />
So none were harmed—this sealed the war’s amphibious stake.</p>
<p>These ships achieved three critical ends: they gave the Spanish force<br />
Mobility upon the lake to land troops at the source<br />
Of strategic vantage points around that watery ring,<br />
They magnified artillery (cannon from decks could sting),<br />
And they established a blockade to starve the Aztec seat,<br />
Cutting Tenochtitlan’s supplies for water, food, or meat.<br />
Colonial and modern scribes have hailed their potent role,<br />
But so did those who fought, or soared, or lost in conquest’s toll:<br />
In the <strong>1565 interrogatory</strong> from Tlaxcala’s band,<br />
Each witness said the brigantines were among the major stands<br />
That overcame Tenochtitlan. “Los dichos vergantines,”<br />
One swore, “were chief among the reasons for the city’s final scenes.”<br />
That both sides recognized it underscores the crucial note:<br />
These ships, and thus their building, were the war’s most weighty boat.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>In <strong>1875</strong>, Texcoco’s municipal domain<br />
Unveiled an obelisk, <strong>15 feet tall</strong>, to mark the campaign<br />
Of launching brigantines in 1521, still known<br />
As “Puente de los Bergantines” (see <strong>Figure 9</strong> that’s shown).<br />
Built near the spot where folks believe the ships were sent to sea,<br />
It bears a plaque up top, proclaiming simply that Cortés <strong>(April 5, 1521)</strong><br />
Launched those war vessels triumphantly.<br />
Yet thousands of Natives, in that winter and that spring,<br />
Had built <strong>13 ships</strong> and a canal to conquer the Aztec king.<br />
The plaque omits that Native hands enabled all of this;<br />
We won’t fault those who built the monument, for knowledge was amiss—<br />
At that time, Native records lay undiscovered, so the rest<br />
Of conquest lore was incomplete; few knew the Natives’ zest.<br />
Even now, the naval epic of 1520–21<br />
Remains obscure, especially how the Native roles were done.</p>
<p>This article has aimed to bring that story back to light—<br />
Too often, Spanish folks alone receive the glory bright.<br />
The truth is that their allies—<strong>Culhuacan, Chalco</strong> too,<br />
Cholula, Huejotzingo, Tetzcoco, Tlaxcala’s retinue—<br />
Joined forces, cutting trees, sawing timbers, carving wood,<br />
Transporting logs, assembling planks, to forge this navy good.<br />
Such labor was essential, but we also must behold<br />
How <strong>Indigenous knowledge</strong> of environment took its bold<br />
Position, letting them design canal and choose the place,<br />
Lining walls, erecting embankments, or fortifying space.<br />
They spent long ages in the Basin, gleaning watery science there,<br />
So when Cortés said “Build me ships!”, they labored without despair.<br />
Hence it’s this synergy of local skill and manpower’s gift<br />
That made these Native folks the “Masters” of that naval shift.</p>
<p>And as for Texcoco’s monument, from 1875,<br />
It still endures on Calle Juárez Sur, though passersby may strive<br />
To glean its meaning in the sprawl, overshadowed by modern gloom.<br />
But we who read these records see how, once, in that same room,<br />
They built the brigs and dug the ditch that sealed Tenochtitlan’s doom.<br />
With knowledge, might, and synergy, those Natives changed the tide—<br />
They formed the conquest’s heart and soul, whatever books confide.</p>
