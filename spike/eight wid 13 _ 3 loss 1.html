            <p><strong>A “Lossless” Seuss-Style Rendition (Anapestic Tetrameter)<br />
<em>(All original facts and references retained, with no omissions or additions.)</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>[1]</strong><br />
Behold the <strong>Epiclassic Mixtec ceremonial place</strong>,<br />
Where <em>Codex Zouche-Nuttall</em> (obverse) spans a <strong>forty-one-page</strong> space.<br />
It’s mainly documenting the ceremonies told,<br />
Their histories, and the ideology they hold.<br />
Because its rituals echo those of <strong>Codex Vienna</strong>,<br />
I’ll name that worldview “Epiclassic Mixtec” as my henna.<br />
Three separate “sagas” fill these pages in a row,<br />
Each “ritual history” in content’s how they flow:<br />
Lineage, certain rituals, and that <strong>Cult of the Dead</strong>,<br />
All form a cosmic tapestry in everything that’s said.</p>
<p><strong>[2]</strong><br />
On <strong>Zouche-Nuttall</strong> pages 1 through 8, each pictogram you meet—<br />
Even the War from Heaven capture scenes on pages 3 and 4 complete—<br />
They are ceremonies. Their central place,<br />
<strong>Apoala</strong>, in the Mixtec space,<br />
Exchanging ceremonial bits with Yucuñudahui’s land,<br />
So the codex scribes proclaim that bond so grand.<br />
From older narratives, we know the oracles within<br />
Endured as a Mixtec stabilizer, steadfast kin.<br />
Meanwhile, the codex’s reverse—<strong>Lord Eight Deer Jaguar Claw</strong> we see—<br />
Tells of changes that warlord sought, but they weren’t meant to be:<br />
<strong>Codex Bodley</strong> shows that after Eight Deer’s death in AD 1115,<br />
His reforms (linked to Chalcatongo’s oracle) left few traces in between.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>[3]</strong><br />
<strong>Shifts in Epiclassic settlement</strong> and ideology appear,<br />
In <strong>Nochixtlan Valley</strong> (per Spores 1969:560c) quite clear.<br />
Older sites from about AD 300 slipped away by Classic’s end,<br />
That phasing out occurred with time, bridging periods that blend.<br />
We call that bridging “Epiclassic,” from Late Classic to Postclassic’s stage,<br />
Yet some sites thrived, like <strong>Yucuita</strong>, with Yucuñudahui turning its page.<br />
Other civic centers also formed or else they grew apace—<br />
Cerro Jasmin, Jaltepec (Monkey Hill, Suchixtlan’s place).<br />
By Epiclassic or Early Postclassic days, says Spores (1969:561c–562a),<br />
Population soared around AD 1000 on display.<br />
From Yanhuitlan to Sayultepec and Etlantongo’s ridged array,<br />
The Natividad phase saw near continuous dwellings hold their sway.</p>
<p><strong>[4]</strong><br />
<strong>Codex Zouche-Nuttall</strong> plus <strong>Codex Vienna</strong> depict big ideological turns,<br />
The second saga (ZN 14–22) plainly discerns:<br />
(1) Founding Wasp Hill’s lineage prior to Lord Eight Wind’s hour,<br />
(2) The War from Heaven extermination of that power,<br />
(3) At Tilantongo, the next lineage took root.<br />
Four great temples or ceremonial hubs we might impute.<br />
Between pages 14 and 19, “sky” abounds with “descent” from above,<br />
Representing interactions of water, earth, and sky in love.<br />
Thirteen sky/water pictures from 14 to 22 appear,<br />
Five show cave openings, three with folks—so that is clear.<br />
Saga one (pages 1 to 8) shows only once a watery place,<br />
Another scene (page 5) pours water from a jar with grace,<br />
While sky as icon emerges but once on page 4’s war design,<br />
Where Striped Men from the Sky are seized in conflict so malign.<br />
Hence pages 1–8 have twenty-five images of cave or earth,<br />
And minimal sky or water forms do mark that saga’s birth.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>[5]</strong><br />
<strong>Codex Vienna</strong> begins with order in the sky so dear,<br />
Where the greatest moment: <strong>Lord Nine Wind Quetzalcoatl’s</strong> birth appears.<br />
All subsequent stuff in Vienna depends on that event,<br />
And across other codices, Nine Wind is also bent<br />
On battling Stone Men and Striped Men in that War from Heaven’s call.<br />
He even fights Lady Nine Grass (oracle at Chalcatongo’s hall).<br />
That fight in Nochixtlan’s southern valley we see in ZN (20b–21a) told,<br />
Mirroring epic ideological shifts of old.  </p>
<p><strong>[6]</strong><br />
Thus, with Nine Wind’s portrayal, we watch a lineage undone—<br />
The <strong>Wasp Hill</strong> clan extinguished, replaced by brand-new lineage begun.<br />
<strong>Codex Vienna</strong> centers on sky elements at Apoala,<br />
While ZN’s first saga fosters more earth-cave aura.<br />
<strong>Lord Eight Wind</strong> arises from a watery cave once (page 1 is that track),<br />
But the rest are purely earth or temple caves, leading him back<br />
To show how “caves” represent transitions in Mixtec domain.<br />
Note that pages 1–8 have only one watery scene again,<br />
And only one sky cameo found (page 4) in that War from Heaven fight;<br />
Hence the epic tilt is earth-based, not water or sky in sight.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>[7]</strong><br />
In saga three (ZN 36–41), once more we start at <strong>Apoala</strong> land,<br />
With a cave event but lacking sky illusions grand.<br />
We see water as rivers and a waterfall on page 36’s line,<br />
No sky images fill that saga, so the difference is divine.<br />
From pages 1–8, we glean that Lord Eight Wind was prime<br />
In fueling wide social changes that emerged in his time.<br />
He either joined or helped forge new lineage with the “People of Rain,”<br />
Later codices show that lineage was key in Mixtec’s domain.</p>
<p><strong>[8]</strong><br />
Though ZN never shows him fighting in War from Heaven’s prime,<br />
He faced the Stone Men conflict, playing a major role sublime,<br />
And shaped new rule by tree-born nobles from dear Apoala’s throne,<br />
Then, beyond his active politics, he married thrice when older grown.<br />
He fathered lines that later warred—Tilantongo versus Jaltepec’s clan—<br />
Both parties came from daughters of Eight Wind, so that was the plan.<br />
But “Hua Chino” lineage was not from him (Caso 1964:54a states),<br />
Hence they were exterminated in that alliance war of fates.</p>
<p><strong>[9]</strong><br />
Even postmortem, Eight Wind’s corpse bore influence so strong,<br />
His mummy could prompt new wars among the kin who got along—<br />
Or used to. The codex scribes provide connections that relate<br />
Events on the manuscript reverse in <strong>Lord Eight Deer</strong>’s state.<br />
Hence we see that the first saga ties Early Epiclassic times,<br />
A new Mixtec society to later historic climbs:<br />
All through the lens of one patriarch’s power, enshrined in fear and awe,<br />
He shaped them mystically and physically, a father with wide draw.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>[10]</strong><br />
Lord Eight Wind was <em>indeed</em> a patriarch in stride—<br />
He lived to ninety-two, then left a lineage multiplied.<br />
Descent from him through daughters gave certain royals right<br />
To claim female-line ascendancy by genealogical might.<br />
All three obverse sagas revolve around lineages formed,<br />
And tie themselves by ancestry that each event has warmed.<br />
Hence <strong>Jansen and Jimenez (2005:14b)</strong> propose a name for this codex text:<br />
“Codex Tonindeye,” “Book of Lineage History,” so context is unvexed.</p>
<p><strong>[11]</strong><br />
They say that early Mixtec history’s done in threefold track:<br />
Saga one (pages 1–8) reveals new lineage at Apoala’s back.<br />
Saga two (pages 14–22) shows an older clan removed<br />
And new ceremonial centers discovered or proved.<br />
Finally, saga three (36–41) is fully from that Apoala line,<br />
So these scribes kept trifocal vantage to show how times combine.  </p>
<p><strong>[12]</strong><br />
To deliver the data in Zouche-Nuttall’s first eight leaves,<br />
They used some clever formats that imagination weaves.<br />
One trick is “eclipse” or “hiding” pages by a fold,<br />
Yet another merges chronologies with Vienna’s told.<br />
A kind of “literary duality” is also at play:<br />
Pages come in pairs, each pair a data set that day.<br />
Pages 1 and 2: Lord Eight Wind’s introduction in a supernatural role,<br />
Making “People of the Rain” and “Land of the Rain God” the Mixtec soul.<br />
Pages 3 and 4: The War from Heaven in twin arcs—<br />
Stone Men first, Striped Men next—two separate warlike sparks.<br />
Pages 5 and 6: The lineage founding and the patron deities appear,<br />
Then 7 and 8 shift focus to Lord Eight Deer’s future sphere.<br />
These last two pages have “metaphysical” events: a cult of the dead in sight,<br />
As two deceased kings’ mummy bundles attend a conference at night.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>[13]</strong><br />
Additionally, on pages 3 and 4, each ends in part<br />
Of a ceremony from <strong>Apoala</strong> that’s spliced so they can start<br />
Half each on separate pages, forming two halves of a whole,<br />
While the protagonist, Eight Wind, shares with Nine Wind a role:<br />
He’s “double-born,” so Quetzalcoatl parallels abide—<br />
Two sequential chronologies link each other in stride.<br />
Yes, Lord Eight Wind had “two lives”: first fifty-two near-supernatural years,<br />
Then a final forty years more human, as it appears.<br />
And beyond the grave he lingered in a third plane as well,<br />
Influencing politics from a posthumous mystic shell.</p>
<p><strong>[14]</strong><br />
<strong>Codex Zouche-Nuttall</strong> is not alone—its “sister” stands,<br />
<strong>Codex Vienna</strong>, tied since Zelia Nuttall laid her hands<br />
Upon them. Montezuma II bestowed these bright artifacts so grand<br />
To Hernán Cortés as treasure leaving Aztec land (Nuttall 1902:9a–11b in brand).<br />
They traveled to Europe side by side, then parted ways at last,<br />
Physically split but conceptually tied by scholars in centuries passed.<br />
They share a historical, ideological unity in art so bold,<br />
Proclaiming Mixtec glory from over seven centuries old.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>[15]</strong><br />
Now, these ancient manuscripts were not composed for our eyes,<br />
Yet they act as time machines unveiling realms of surprise.<br />
They show a world unshaped by Europe’s regal hand,<br />
A place of living power in each noble’s stand.<br />
These great houses of lords and ladies governed close domain,<br />
Their might enthralls us even now, beyond the modern plain.  </p>
<p><strong>[16]</strong><br />
Yet a sorrow also resonates in 1521’s array,<br />
When Europeans arrived in <strong>Oaxaca</strong>, took societies away.<br />
A new cultural paradigm swept the old ways aside,<br />
Leaving folks “without history,” though they once strode in pride.<br />
The Mixtec codices—fragile, painted on gessoed leather leaves—<br />
Are truer testaments to that lost world than gold or jeweled heaves.<br />
Perhaps that’s why Montezuma II included them among his “treasure,”<br />
They might outlast the gold or gems across centuries’ measure.<br />
Indeed, the Spanish plunder’s mostly vanished or forgot,<br />
While five centuries later, these codices remain, a precious lot.  </p>
<p><strong>[17]</strong><br />
Today, in calmer moments, we see the real trove so keen:<br />
These Mixtec manuscripts, the <em>tonindeye</em>, preserving genealogies unseen.<br />
Accounts of mighty kings and queens who walked that land so wide,<br />
And shaped their realm through ideology and politics with pride.<br />
Here, in these few surviving books, the world’s great literatures hold a gem:<br />
Oaxacan states where authority rose from lords, a shining stem.<br />
Thus the Mixtec culture thrived by what their heroes wrought,<br />
And even after centuries, their story remains well-fought.  </p>
