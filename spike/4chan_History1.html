<ul><li>1996 - A man named Masayuki Shiba creates a BBS called Ayashii Warudo (Strange/Suspicious World). Users are anonymous. Warez and cp are posted, and there is a “gesu” (scum) board where a group of the same name discussed and conducted website hackings and invasions. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki/2ch-History#origins">Many similar BBSes are formed, collectively called Nanashi Warudo</a> (Nameless World), they develop a culture based on memes. Ayashii World functions as the hubsite of Nanashi World in a similar way to how 4chan would later function as the hubsite of Anonymous. AW's popularity increases exponentially. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://ayashiiworldhistory.blogspot.com/2012/10/test.html">History of Ayashii World</a>.</li>
<li>1998 - Ayashii World doesn't have good servers, and it keeps crashing. After the owner receives personal threats over the server issues, he shuts the site down. They need a replacement. They get their replacement with Amezou, the First Channel, run by Amezou-shi. It starts off as a bunch of links to alternative BBSes for wayward Ayashii Worlders, but soon becomes its own forum and introduces a new style of threaded message board, dependent on bumping and saging. Its popularity increases exponentially.</li>
<li>1999 - The administrator of the first channel closes the site due to vandalism, before that, he makes a plea for its users to make more sites like Amezou. A man named Hiroyuki Nishimura sees all this and creates <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki/2ch-History">Ni Channeru (2channel), the Second Channel</a>, using code based on the first, with enough servers this time to handle the exponential growth. Meanwhile, Lowtax creates Something Awful.</li>
<li>April/May 2001 - Lowtax creates the ADTRW (Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse) board on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki/Something-Awful">Something Awful.</a></li>
<li>August 30, 2001 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki/2ch-History#unix-and-2chan-and-the-august-2001-crisis">2channel is in danger of dying</a>, so a backup forum is created, called Futaba or 2chan (two-leaves). Futaba invents a board called /b/ for random content. The site supports images and develops a unique culture all its own, growing out of the seed culture brought by the 2channelers.</li></ul>

<ul><li>3 March 2003 - The first English language channel is created: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki/world2ch">world2ch</a>, made by RIR6, a 16 year old Japanese user. At first, it supported text only. Its userbase consists of a mix of Japanese and English users, the only time that this happens for any considerable amount of time. The English speakers there are members of ADTRW, and they are also familiar with Futaba and visit it as a pasttime. Later, English users would convince the owner to make an imageboard. He makes two, officially becoming the first western imageboards.</li>
<li>2003 - The 2chan appreciation thread is created on ADTRW, becoming the gateway between the eastern Internet culture and western. World2ch is discovered and posted on said thread, gaining a steady influx of English speaking users.</li>
<li>September 29 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://i.imgur.com/mf0BMfJ.png">moot registers 4chan.net</a>, just because it looked like 2chan.net (Futaba Channel) which was an ADTRW pastime. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://shii.bibanon.org/www.jonnydigital.com/4chan-history.html">According to former 4chan mod Jonnydigital</a>, moot's original intention was only to own an e-mail address @4chan.net, but he quickly gets thinking...</li></ul>
<pre>&lt;moot&gt; regging 4CHAN.net
&lt;moot&gt; FOUR CHAN
&lt;moot&gt; brace for faggotry
</pre>
<ul><li>September 30: moot announces 4chan.net in Something Awful's ADTRW forum. Thread is titled "4chan.net - English 2chan.net!"</li>
<li>October 1 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070626030323/http://forums.somethingawful.com:80/showthread.php?threadid=724028">4chan is founded by moot, a member of the Something Awful forums,</a> intended to be used as an English version of 2chan, a Japanese imageboard created in 2001 out of an extremely popular Japanese BBS called 2channel. moot creates <b>/b/</b> (Anime/Random) and makes a topic at Something Awful and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200314123218/http://world2ch.org/dramabomb.html">world2ch about the website</a>, which is received extremely well. moot also holds a contest to decide what 4chan's logo should be. Within three hours of creating the contest, around 50 banners are submitted, after which moot decides to simply make it so that it would cycle through the best banners randomly every time a page was loaded.</li>
<li>October 2 - 4chan's hosting company receives an e-mail complaining about "lolikon and guro posted in /b/, to which moot writes back that neither of the two is illegal. Later in the day, moot creates a second board, <b>/h/</b> (Hentai). The email was sent by Shii/Menchi because the people of world2ch felt 4chan ripped them off (Which is inaccurate, since world2ch was a sister site to 2ch and 4chan was a sister site to Futaba/2chan) moot later befriended them. The rules page describes /b/ as a test board which will later become an anime board. moot describes /b/ in a news post as "a retard bin".</li>
<li>October 6 - moot creates four new imageboards: <b>/c/</b> (Anime/Cute), <b>/d/</b> (Hentai/Alternative), <b>/w/</b> (Wallpapers/Anime), and <b>/y/</b> (Yaoi), along with an oekaki BBS board (<b>/i/</b>). The /y/ board is unique in that (at the time) it was <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://yaoi.livejournal.com/753839.html">user</a>-<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://badluck.livejournal.com/127300.html">moderated</a>. moot also fixes a retention bug that cause posts to be deleted too quickly and raised the maximum number of log entries for each board from 500 to 5000 (2000 for /b/).</li>
<li>October 9 - Two new imageboards are created: <b>/g/</b> (Guro), to clean the nastiest imagery on /h/, and <b>/s/</b> (Sexy Beautiful Women), both of which are user-moderated. moot announces that 4chan received over one million hits in the past six days and may be looking for sponsors to help pay the bills. /s/ is managed by Boco_T and PotatoSan. Boco_T also drew two of 4chan's title images: one of Osaka from Azumanga Daioh, and one of Cardcaptor Sakura drawn in the style of Fist of the North Star.</li>
<li>October 16 - 4chan is announced to 2chan, resulting in a massive amount of Japanese users coming to the site, at least doubling the traffic of all boards and decoupling the traffic of /c/. The onslaught of unexpected traffic causes /b/ to crash for two days, killing it for the first time.</li>
<li>October 21 - 4chan.net is moved to United Colo, a collocation and webhosting company, following a discussion on the Something Awful forums.</li>
<li>October 29 - The site is back online. moot makes various changes to the imageboards, including Japanese character display and adding the day of the week to posts. He also announces that the boards will now use a MySQL database (a modified form of 2chan's futabaSQL called yotsubaSQL) and added a robots.txt file to the site to keep out some auto-downloaders, along with an .htaccess file to prevent hotlinking. /g/ temporarily suffered a problem with tripcodes, and all boards had a problem where users said their posts were not appearing and they were getting a Japanese error message. Both of these were fixed within the day by modifying the anti-spam script and fixing the imageboards' .php files, respectively.</li>
<li>November 1 - moot begs for donations in the first of a long history of times, complaining that the site is running extremely slowly and that he would have to block Japanese domains unless something was done, and that the cost of moot's server bill was now $400/month. moot warns that 4chan will die slowly unless enough donations are received.</li>
<li>November 2 - moot resets img.4chan.net and deletes all posts, drops all MySQL tables, and reduces the maximum post limit for each board from 3000 to 750. MySQLd and PHP were optimized and moot laments that he cannot implement auto-pruning after ten pages like 2chan.</li>
<li>November 8 - Two more imageboards are added: <b>/a/</b> (Anime) and <b>/l/</b> (Lolikon), because /c/ was flooded with NSFW images. moot announces the future release of a database of archived 4chan threads that requires a paid subscription, which had been suggested by Spork, a mod, a week before.  By this time /b/ lost the anime/random subtitle and became just a random board.</li>
<li>November 10 - moot and his friend thatdog begin testing on the beta-archive and set up a new board, <b>/r/</b> (Trains) to test it with. The same day, thatdog registers 1chan.net and sets up a similar train board on his site. /r/ quickly fills with /b/tards in order to help moot out.</li>
<li>November 20 - Apex tells moot that 4chan has to go. 4chan dies for the second time. 4chan then is hosted by GoDaddy.</li>
<li>November 22 - The site returns following two days of downtime after the server is reformatted to RH9, making the site considerably faster. moot deletes /r/ (Trains) and announces that the thread archive will be up shortly. The next day, the RH9 apt-get repository was cleared out, causing GIFs not to be thumbnailed correctly for a few hours.</li>
<li>November 28 - moot announces downtime to fix some problems.</li>
<li>November 29 - Downtime cancelled. Staff member DJ Lucid managed to fix every single problem without needing to reformat the servers.</li>
<li>December 16 - A new board is created, <b>/t/</b> (Torrents), along with a torrent tracker. moot tightens the rules regarding /h/ and /l/ and cracks down on rule breakers. moot also considers blocking Japanese domains due to the fact that they make up half of 4chan's traffic and post only extremely rarely.</li>
<li>December 17 - moot blocks all Japanese domains from accessing the site, significantly reducing 4chan's server bill while maintaining the same level of contribution. Apparently, moot says that in the two weeks before the announcement, Japanese domains had accounted for 650 GB but only made about fifty posts or so.</li>
<li>December 20 - 4chan changes its board software from modified GazouBBS (modified 2chan code) to Futallaby, created by 1chan's thatdog.</li>
<li>December 29 - Following a massive flood of real-life child pornography, /l/ (Lolikon) is temporarily deleted. moot announces that although he has blocked Japanese domains, his traffic from the rest of the world has now passed the rate from before December 17, meaning that moot's server bill is still $400/month.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="2004">2004</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/index.php?title=4chan/History&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: 2004">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<ul><li>January 8 - /l/ (Lolikon) returns along with a new imageboard, <b>/r/</b> (Request), which was created after many posts on /t/ were requests instead of links to torrents, so a new board was created for torrent requests, although it quickly morphed into the /r/ we know and love today.</li>
<li>January 13 - "/b/tard" is first used on /b/, in a followup to someone suggesting that "/b/astard" be a collective name.</li>
<li>January 25 - Censored Vagina announces that the torrent tracker has been taken down due to it being a major strain on the server, along with the /t/ board. Censored Vagina announces that the torrent tracker will return shortly, albeit it in a considerably smaller form, with a maximum of 40 torrents.</li>
<li>February 11 - Something Awful user "nubdestroyer" attempts to get 4chan shut down, this time by e-mailing GoDaddy, the owner of 4chan.net. He succeeds. 4chan moves to 4chan.org where it is today.</li>
<li>February 14 - After GoDaddy suspends the 4chan.net domain three days before without moot realizing it, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/3fEPz">moot registers 4chan.org as a temporary domain</a> until everything is sorted out.  Thus, 4chan died for the third time.</li>
<li>February 19 - <b>/t/</b> (Torrents) returns, albeit without the tracker, along with a new board, <b>/f/</b> (Flash). moot adds a new server, cgi.4chan.org, on which /f/ is hosted.</li>
<li>February 21 - Two discussion boards are added, hosted on 0ch: /amh/ (Anime-Manga-Hentai) and /bbs/ (4chan Discussion). The next day, Censored Vagina makes a newspost announcing that the cost of running 4chan for the rest of 2004 added up to $2,200 and that the money would be needed in donations. The links on 4chan are reflected to link to 4chan.org instead of 4chan.net so that users will not need to write 4chan.org's IP into their hosts file.</li>
<li>March 1 - moot announces that the site will not be able to continue because the March server bill is too large to pay and that more donations will be required to pay it or 4chan will die. He makes one final request for donations and hopes for the best.  According to a news post image about the original /q/, /q/ - Questions was added this day (it appeared at the end of the board list as "/q/ - EMERGENCY DISCUSSION").</li>
<li>March 8 - After a week-long swarm of donations, moot announces that not only does he have enough money to pay the March bill, but that enough money was donated to keep the site running into 2005. moot thanks all donators and posters and announces that he is currently in "Cancun, Mexico".</li>
<li>March 28 - The 4chan.org domain becomes permanent, with 4chan.net now occupied by domain squatters (people who buy domains that will get a lot of traffic, such as porn.com, and put ads on the page). moot tells users to inform all people linking to 4chan about this change so that the domain squatters receive as little traffic as possible and therefore not profit from the incident. moot also deletes /g/ (Guro) around this time, possibly due to issues with PayPal.</li>
<li>March 30-31 - <b>/cm/</b> (Cute Male) was created on one of these days to keep male content out of /c/.</li>
<li>April 1 - As an April Fools' Day prank, moot posts pictures of a man in a graduation uniform shortly after getting his diploma from Stanford University, and posts another picture of the man on April 4, this time showing him next to a statue in Mexico. moot claimed that the man in the photographs was him, and that his name was Robert Bopkins, and this was believed by most of 4chan for a long while until moot appeared in the flesh at the 2005 Otakon Panel, revealing himself to have a teenage-like un-nerdy appearance which surprised many /b/tards.</li>
<li>April 4 - Spork (4chan mod) creates an official IRC channel for 4chan, hosted on irc.pyoko.org. The channel was later moved, hosted on irc.rizon.net, where it remains today.</li>
<li>April 19 - 100K GET on /b/ is reached. Many were creating new topics rapidly in hopes of getting the GET for themselves, but 100K GET turned out to be an unrelated text reply in a thread that attempted to be 100K GET. The reply was completely unrelated to the thread that it was in, only saying "lol internet" with no image. To this day, it is considered to be the most win that a GET has ever been.</li>
<li>April 30 - moot announces that the text boards are back up, running on board software created by Shii (4chan mod and friend of moot from SA). Two of these text boards were added that day as well: /dis/ (Discussion) and /sug/ (Suggestion) (now both deleted).</li>
<li>June 15 - TheRowan, owner of HentaiKey and host of 5chan, attempts to get 4chan shut down. This time by e-mailing PayPal who controlled 4chan's donations at the time. He succeeds.</li>
<li>June 20 - A day that will live forever in short-term memory. 4chan dies for the fourth and longest time, for nearly six weeks. moot blames lack of contribution and donations, asshole posters, and GNAA flooding, among other things, as the reasons for 4chan's death.</li>
<li>August 7 - 4chan returns in its fifth incarnation following six weeks of downtime after gathering up enough money and support. Many new moderators , developers and server administrators are added as well. News posts by staff members are made under the name of “The Team”</li>
<li>August 15 - 4chan changes its board software to a "super-hacked" version of Futallaby coded mostly by W.T. Snacks. It contains many new features such as replying with an image, hiding posts, the Name and E-mail fields, displaying image names and sizes, and linking to other posts by adding a &gt;&gt; next to the post number. Tripcodes were also added to /f/.</li>
<li>August 16 - Saved thread reveals that the following boards existed already: <b>/m/</b> and "/n/" (Trains). The discussion boards "/anime"/, "/ascii/" and "/game/" already existed. /r/ was named "/r/ - Request". Top of page boards list: a/b/c/d/f/g/h/l/m/n/p/r/s/t/<b>u</b>/w cm/y anime/ascii/dis/game/sug.</li>
<li>September 8 - Three new boards are added: <b>/k/</b> (Weapons), <b>/o/</b> (Auto), and /sm/ (Shota/Male). Jibaku (4chan mod) announces that /b/ is severely lacking in quality and asks users to contribute better.</li>
<li>October 1 - 4chan turns one year old.</li>
<li>October 9 - Four boards are added: /ib/ (Oekaki Random), /ip/ (Oekaki Pro), <b>/v/</b> (Video Games), and /tech/ (Technology, discussion board); one board, /n/ (Trains) is deleted. The oekaki BBS board, /i/, is deleted to make way for the two new oekaki boards. Around this time, /z/ (ZOMG NONE!!1), a user-moderated board which utilizes the “Idiot King” model from SA’s FYAD, where the userbase has to vote for its mods, is created. The board features flashing backgrounds, annoying embedded music, and legendary posts. Their first moderator was Soviet Russia !lM51PoudCg) .</li>
<li>October 30 - 4chan hosts a panel at the AnimeUSA 2004 Con in Vienna, Virginia. The same day, 4chan experiences DNS problems, and asks that people edit their host files once again.</li>
<li>October 31 - /l/ (Lolikon) and /sm/ (Shotakon) are deleted due to threats of legal action.</li>
<li>November 1 - squeeks registers 4-ch.net, a site not related to 4chan's text boards. moot complains that squeeks is stealing his thunder. The site is based on 2channel rather than Futaba, and consists of text boards rather than imageboards, and is run on a heavily modified version of Kareha coded by !WAHa.06x36. Man of Wax (4chan mod) begs for donations and advertising on the front page of 4chan. /z/ was deleted shortly after this time.</li>
<li>November 5 - moot registers not4chan.org and moves /l/ and /sm/ there instead.</li>
<li>November 15 - /g/ (Guro) is deleted as well due to threats from YowCow to seize 4chan's donations account due to guro being against YowCow's ToS.</li>
<li>December 1 - Earliest known time when <b>/tl/</b> - Torrents/Loli existed (likely hosted on not4chan.org)</li></ul>

<ul><li>January 6 - Cracky-chan saga - The first picture of a strangely artistic teenager appears on /b/. Anonymous becomes infatuated with the girl and scours the Internet for her pictures. A tripfag under the name of cracky-chan!N1toQkxgzc starts posting.</li>
<li>January 13 - 4chan's IRC channel moves from irc.pyoko.org to irc.rizon.net. This is announced on the front page, along with one of the first lines ever spoken in 4chan's Rizon channel: &lt;moot&gt; i wish to be the little girl.</li>
<li>January 19 - Four new boards are added: <b>/e/</b> (Ecchi), /3/ (3DCG, stands for 3-D Computer Graphics), <b>/g/</b> (Technology), and /n/ (Nature &amp; Wildlife). /g/ and /n/ are worksafe.</li>
<li>January 27 - Three more boards are added: <b>/ic/</b> (Artwork/Critique), <b>/p/</b> (Photography), and /x/ (General Photo). Although there was already a /p/ board for photography before, it is the replacement, with new features (such as EXIF data), /x/ takes a general photography board, where all photography goes, and /p/ becomes specifically about pictures taken by users or artists.</li>
<li>February 3 - moot and shut register ikuzo.org, a side project they had formulated during 4chan's downtime in summer 2004. The site was basically meant to be a weeaboo site with news and reviews of things like anime, hentai, and general Japanese imports. However, the project is quickly abandoned and the site now redirects to img.4chan.org.</li>
<li>February 5 - The Cracky-chan obsession becomes so big W. T. Snacks wordfiltered her name with similarly sounding names (Creaky-chan, fappy-chan, etc). Many stalkers created fansites.</li>
<li>February 13 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://ia801307.us.archive.org/view_archive.php?archive=/6/items/4chanCaps2005/4chan-caps-2005.zip&amp;file=4chan-caps-2005%2Fdata.4chan.org%2Fb%2Fsrc%2F1118018331358.png">700K GET</a>is fixed by the mods, with the word "ZERO HOUR" written in extremely large letters and the post count reset to 1, and the message, "ONLY 699999 TO GO GUYS!!". However, the post count is restored within the day.</li>
<li>February 20 - The last known time that <b>/tl/</b> - Torrents/Loli existed.</li>
<li>February 26 - Following a IRC townhall, moot creates three more boards: <b>/gif/</b> (Animated GIF), <b>/hr/</b> (High Resolution), <b>/wg/</b> (Wallpapers/General), and removes /x/.</li>
<li>March 29 - A Livejournal from Cracky, freakygirl, is found. The owner of a Cracky-chan website, Creacky-chan.com claims it’s fake, though it may have been a move to protect her identity. Another Livejournal, kittykat soon gets found, whether fake or real.</li>
<li>March 31 - moot purchases a new server (tmp.4chan.org, backup of orz.4chan.org) and announces that it will be up in April. He also announces that 4chan will have a panel at Otakon 2005 and announces that he would soon recruit a new administrator following DJ Lucid's (4chan admin) departure.</li>
<li>April 1 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://ia801307.us.archive.org/view_archive.php?archive=/6/items/4chanCaps2005/4chan-caps-2005.zip&amp;file=4chan-caps-2005%2Fdata.4chan.org%2Fb%2Fsrc%2F1118029064543.jpg">Aprils Fur’s Day</a>- For April Fools' Day, moot makes a front-page newspost containing a picture of Robert Bopkins (thought to be moot at the time) in graduation gear shortly after graduating from Stanford University, along with the message "GREETINGS FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL!". moot also creates a new board, /fur/ (Furry), despite his promise never to do so. Although many think it the board is simply an April Fools' Day joke, the board remained the next day, and the board was started to be taken seriously. However, on the morning of April 3rd, everyone who had posted in /fur/ was banned for three months (including /b/tards who posted on /fur/ to denounce furries), following which 4chan was almost rid of furfags. This event has remained embedded in the mind of every furry in hopes of moot ever making a new, permanent version of /fur/.</li>
<li>April 3 - Shii cracks Cracky-chan’s tripcode. Since the password was “sweet”, the theory of a fake tripfag gains solidity.</li>
<li>April 6 - Another of Cracky-chan’s Livejournal get known under the name of “scarecrownmaiden”. It contained many more artsy pictures, even nudes. The journal gets deleted quickly by the owner.</li>
<li>April 7 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://ia801307.us.archive.org/view_archive.php?archive=/6/items/4chanCaps2005/4chan-caps-2005.zip&amp;file=4chan-caps-2005%2Fdata.4chan.org%2Fb%2Fsrc%2F1118095509661.png">1M GET is reached on /b/</a>. It was considered an "alright" GET, neither fail nor win. 1M GET was posted by a namefag under the handle Senator Rodden Clitoris, who posted picture of Sae Sawanoguchi from Magic Users Club having an orgasm, with the text/copypasta "Female Orgasm", which was deleted within a few seconds. The mods instead chose another thread with a picture of a budgie in a jar and changed its posted number to 1000000 and stickied it, fooling many into believing that it was the true 1M GET.</li>
<li>May 12 to June 6 - <b>/3/</b> - 3DCG was probably deleted somewhere in this period, according to ancient 4chan screenshots.</li>
<li>June 6 - Cracky-chan pics become a bannable offense, according to W. T. Snacks, per alleged request of Cracky-chan herself.</li>
<li>July - /b/ Warchief Rend Niggerhand opens Crackypedia, a place with all storts of stalkerish information about Cracky</li>
<li>July 1 - Many of 4chan's boards were closed unexpectedly and announcement was supposedly made by "moot's secretary" was posted on the front page, announcing that moot had abandoned 4chan and that 4chan would cease operations in a few days due to lack of funding. The next day, moot made a newspost announcing that that this had all happened behind his back, and that the post was neither true nor official.</li>
<li>July 29 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://i.imgur.com/iW3IIKS.png">/b/ reaches 2M GET</a>, a picture of someone holding up a notepad with "2000000 GET?" written on it, and the text "HAY GUYS! 2MIL GET! -Delcious Ironing" [sic]. This was (badly) photoshopped with a smiling ugly man and the text, "HAY GUYEZ WOULD YOU BE UP FOR SOME ADULT FUN AT MY COUNTRY CLUB SOMETIME -Delcious ron", which spawned a whole series of other shopped GETs.</li>
<li>August 12 - Saturgay, /b/ gets spammed with images of Seizure 5, Hard Gay and Sageman</li>
<li>August 13 - Shortly after celebrating one year of uptime, 4chan starts its panel at Otakon 2005, the first time ever that /b/tards actually met the real moot, after which moot revealed that "Robert Bopkins" was not only not him, but that Bopkins' name was actually Eric J. Ross and that moot picked the photos at random. Everyone has a really good time and moot hangs out with the other /b/tards who flip out over the fact that they are experiencing mootfaggotry IRL.</li>
<li>August 23 - 7chan is created</li>
<li>August 28 - Donate or Die 2005 starts, with moot announcing that he requires $20,000 in donations to purchase three new servers (bin.4chan.org, nov.4chan.org, and a second img.4chan.org). Frenzy started, with camwhores showing their tits and vagoo if users donated to 4chan. Within a week, $14,000 was raised, which was actually enough to purchase the three servers, although they fell short of their goal. Later, on September 15th, moot announces that donations will cease September 30th, and even then can only be delivered by snail mail.</li>
<li>October 1 - 4chan turns two years old. Dan makes a commemorative picture.</li>
<li>October 16 - 3M GET on /b/, with a picture of Waha and Pedobear and how they would be seen in America. The post linked to itself, prefixed by "&gt;&gt;3000000" and "TIME PARADOX/what a lame GET/Surely you jest!". It was, unfortunately, a tripfag get, posted by 4chan mod Pixel Hotness !Ol2RiO/0Ro. The GET was considered "meh" and was suspected to have been a modGET.</li>
<li>October 20 - moot posts a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180521090546/http://rx.vyrd.net/FINALCOUNTDOWN.html">sticky on /b/</a> suddenly announcing that IT'S THE FINAL COUNTDOWN, playing a segment of the titular <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jK-NcRmVcw">song</a> in the thread. Anons worry that it signifies the return of ZERO HOUR and the doom of 4chan. When the music stops playing and nothing happens, anons realize that it's just moot fucking around again.</li>
<li>October 25 - moot announces that "things are looking up" and announces that many new features will be added to 4chan, including the DevBlog. He also begs for people to advertise because he needs money to construct additional pylons.</li>
<li>October 30 - moot and Snacks have a long fight over IRC as moot takes the site down for a few hours to fix some problems. moot rages against Snacks for being a lazy coder and threatens to take away his server access, and generally being very arrogant towards Snacks. They both go to sleep, and continue in the afternoon the next day for about three hours, until moot tells Snacks that he will remove his server access (along with his moderator powers), which he does shortly afterwards, making him unable to moderate or code. Snacks then "leaves" 4chan for good.</li>
<li>November 1-2 - moot challenges Xenon, a popular flash artist camwhore whose artwork is often spammed on /f/, to a camwhore battle, which moot loses. moot then tells Xenon that since he beat him, Xenon received temporary admin status and moot declared November 2 to be "the Day of Xenon". Xenon used his new privileges to change /b/'s CSS layout, resulting in /b/'s background becoming pink and the Powerpuff Girls theme song being embedded into every page. /b/'s title was also changed to "All Hail Xenon".</li>
<li>November 3 - moot, liking the idea of fucking around with /b/'s layout, changes /b/'s background to a seizure-inducing GIF flashing yellow and white, with the techno-country song "Cotton-Eye Joe" by Rednex embedded into the pages. /b/'s title was then changed to "ON A STEEL HORSE I RIDE", and a sticky was created in which the new layout could be discussed.</li>
<li>November 4 - Shortly after midnight, /b/'s layout was changed again to a pink McDonald's-themed background, with "moving JavaScript Golden Arches" as Lurkmore put it, along with a 1980s McDonald's jingle added as background music. This hack lasted for three days and was hated by almost everybody. During this time, Xenon released the chatlogs from moot and Snacks' fight, causing massive outrage on /b/.</li>
<li>December 19 - moot posts a thread in /v/ asking for applications to be a janitor (person who can delete posts but not ban), which was up to that point unheard of. News of this spread to /b/, and many applications were received, and the janitors were implemented within the month.</li>
<li>December 24-25 - /b/ goes Jewish just in time for Hanukkah, with "The Magic Dreidel" wallpaper, JavaScript falling dreidels, and "Dreidel Dreidel Dreidel" as the background music.</li></ul>

<ul><li>January 30 - moot implements forced anonymous on /b/, with users unable to post with a name, tripcode, or subject, remaining until March 26, 2007, which, by then, had definitely worn out its welcome.</li>
<li>February 6 - orz.4chan.org and cgi.4chan.org crash and are not fixed until three days later. During this time, the secret board, /5/, hosted on the orz server, was deleted.</li>
<li>February 12 - Cracky-chan discovers her cult and decides it’s enough. She makes a public statement on 420chan telling everyone to stop. Later, Kirtaner closes the board.</li>
<li>February 17 - The three new servers purchased during the Donate or Die 2005 campaign are successfully brought online. Each served as a backup for three of 4chan's content servers, with nov.4chan.org backing up cgi, bin.4chan.org backing up zip, and tmp.4chan.org backing up orz (img was already backed up by dat.4chan.org). In addition, the new servers took care of all post submissions, speeding up the boards significantly.</li>
<li>February 18 - The day after the new servers are installed, 5M GET is achieved, during which the posting rate increased twenty fold. The servers were put to the test, with jumbo.4chan.org maxing out its line at 99.31 Mbit/s (~12.41 megabytes per second). The 5M GET was a picture of cat taken at an angle that made the cat look large, with the text "Needs more towercat". Users were divided between whether it was win or fail, although moot himself called it "more garbage" in the DevBlog.</li>
<li>March 14 - /a/ was still titled Anime at this time.</li>
<li>March 23 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011110918/http://macrochan.org/get.py?sha1=AOQZRSM37WNTHN3QM7C52NNPMNK5URRE">6M GET was achieved on /b/</a>, with a picture of Senator Bill Frist holding up a card and the text "In after 6M GET". It was mostly considered a winGET due to the potential for epic shoops.</li>
<li>April 1 - /b/'s CSS is fucked with yet again, with the page layout being changed to tanasinn.org's layout, with a looping voice saying "Don't think. Feel and you'll be Tanasinn." Letters were randomly changed to the three-dot triangle symbol.</li>
<li>April 6 - Three new trial boards are added: <b>/co/</b> (Comics &amp; Cartoons), <b>/po/</b> (Papercraft &amp; Origami), and /sp/ (Sports).</li>
<li>April 8 - Five more boards are added: <b>/cgl/</b> (Cosplay &amp; EGL), <b>/ck/</b> (Food &amp; Cooking), <b>/mu/</b> (Music), /n/ (News) (Changing the previous /n/ to <b>/an/ - Animals &amp; Nature</b>), and <b>/tv/</b> (Television). <b>/ib/</b> (Oekaki Random) and <b>/ip/</b> (Oekaki Pro) merged into <b>/i/ - Oekaki</b>. At the time of the merger, /ib/ had accumulated just over 14200 posts, while /ip/ only managed just under 5600 posts. It's possible than when the boards were merged, the final post numbers were combined into one, as evidenced by /i/'s post count being at 23200 by the start of June 2006. The mysterious <b>/yg/</b> - Yogurt board is also created, and Saber adds <b>/ss/</b> - Straight/Shota to not4chan.</li>
<li>April 9 - /b/ got a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.sage.moe/b/thread/6578464/">desu sticky</a> (where the poster was banned).</li>
<li>April 10 - When a user shows his ban reason as being DSFARGEG, he is banned and his thread stickied. Later seven threads are stickied, are stickied along with another DSFARGEG post, which consisted on a puppet from a Japanese show riding a motorcycle.</li>
<li>April 11 - /b/tards start to spam /b/ with the same puppet. Every post gets stickied and banned. This concluded with entire pages consisting only of stickied bans. DSFARGEG would be banned on sight from them on.</li>
<li>April 13 -  By this time, /a/'s title has been changed to Anime &amp; Manga.</li>
<li>April 14 - moot announces that the three servers purchased during Donate or Die 2005 have been collocated and are up and running and also announces that he will rarely use the front page for small updates from now on, instead choosing to announce them on the DevBlog and blotter. moot also announces that 4chan will have a panel at which he will appear at AnimeCentral 2006, which took place on May 6. The next day, moot removes most of the wordfilters on /b/ and implements new ones.</li>
<li>April 20 - 7M GET is reached, but due to the high strain on the server, the file was deleted, and the post had no text. However, mods retrieved the MD5 data from the picture from their database and found that it was the popular image macro of Chopper Dave from Sealab 2021 shouting "UH OHHHHHHH". Also, 13-year-old Mitchell Henderson kills himself, after which /b/ raids his memorial MySpace and the "an hero" meme is born after a classmate of his posted a poem she written on his memorial account in which she constantly referred to him as "an hero".</li>
<li>May 11 - Eight threads are stickied, all consisting of modified versions of a picture from some Japanese show with a puppet riding on a motorcycle and the text "DSFARGEG". All posts were followed by (USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST) and DSFARGEG almost always resulted in a ban or a sticky.</li>
<li>May 18 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.sage.moe/b/thread/8000000/">/b/ reaches 8M GET</a>, one of the first GETs to be auto-stickied. It was considered a WinGET, due to the fact that it was a picture of George Zimmer and the text "HI, I'M GEORGE ZIMMER, FOUNDER AND CEO OF THE MEN'S WEARHOUSE. THIS ISN'T FAKEGET GET. I GUARANTEE IT."</li>
<li>June 14 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011114551/http://macrochan.org/get.py?sha1=6OGNPRBZJBCEHAROQPCSP4C53BPTKLNR">9M GET is reached on /b/.</a>A picture of a fallen Haruhi Suzumiya, over the text "GAFLBLABLFABLGHAGLBLGHALBL". The picture was posted with no accompanying text.</li>
<li>June 15 - Comedian Tom Green starts his own late-night call-in talk show hosted from his own living room, hosted every night at 11 PM EST. Over the next three months, /b/ trolls his show, with around 10% of all calls on the show being prank calls from 4chan. /b/ also focused on a section of his show, "Girl Talk", which featured five stereotypical "dumb chicks" giving advice on relationships. The trolling of Girl Talk was so intense that it was canceled on August 19th because of it, combined with bad response from viewers. It would eventually become a tradition to raid Tom Green whenever he went.</li>
<li>June 17 - A group of anons crapflood the Zelda Guide Forums for fun, after which a member threatens to "hack" 4chan. This prompts their leader, known as "Captain Cornflake" (the name of his raid account on Zelda Guide Forums, he was anonymous on /b/) to post this information to /b/. Many Anonymous joined the raid following this post and crapflooded the forums nearly into oblivion during the night while the moderating team was asleep. As the moderators were surveying the carnage the next morning, one mod actually pleaded for /b/ to stop and said he would give them their own board to spam, which just increased the raid. The forums now require manual admin verification, which keeps out many legit users, resulting in an anon victory.</li>
<li>June 19 - Yet another epic raid occurs, with <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210514095804/https://i.4cdn.org/a/1620961476042.jpg">/b/ destroying naruto-kun.com</a> after a user there posted about their dislike of 4chan. Following a major porn flood after which the site admin threatened to sic the FCC on 4chan, one anon discovered a source code document hidden on the site containing the site's SQL database password (which Anon posted on /b/) as well as loads of unchecked MySQL injection vulnerabilities. Anonymous also discovered that the fucking dumbass's FTP had the same password as his MySQL database, following which tons of anons logged in to the FTP account and deleted everything, destroying the entire site, including premium accounts and the database, and bringing the site down for two days.</li>
<li>July 4 - The first of many in a series of /b/ CSS hacks in July as the background was turned red and the text yellow.</li>
<li>July 6 - Crackypedia closes per (alleged again) Cracky-chan’s request. The owner posts a macro with the date of closure, viewcount (17464) and the message "Hope you enjoyed it folks, I told you it wouldn't last forever."</li>
<li>July 7 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.sage.moe/b/thread/10000000/">10M GET is reached,</a>considered the most failed GET of all time, simply <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140220024054/http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/484">a picture of Hazuki</a> from the anime Tsukuyomi -Moon Phase- on a merry-go-round, with the text "hazukiget". Ironically, it was much later revealed to be a modGET, but with no trickery involved; Shii (4chan admin; coder of discussion boards) got the GET out of pure luck, proving that all modGETs, staged or not, will always be fail.</li>
<li>July 10 - The theme song from "Bill Nye the Science Guy" was embedded into the background of /b/ (no layout changes however).</li>
<li>July 11 - A reporting system across all boards is finally added, with a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/qNXT3">global message</a> complete with image plastered across every board. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.sage.moe/b/thread/10163722/">Response is mixed</a>.</li>
<li>July 12 - The great Habbo raid of July 2006 - 4chan (along with Encyclopedia Dramatica, YTMND, GNAA, Bantown, and myg0t) storm Habbo Hotel. A virtual online role playing game where, among other things, people pay real-life money for online money. Thousands of "nigras" (black characters with afros wearing business suits, the official raid costume) filled nearly every room on the site, especially the Pool Deck, during which the pool was blocked for hours because the pool had AIDS. The sheer number of Anonymous was so great that the Habbo mods could not ban the nigras faster than the accounts were being created, resulting in the mods having no choice but to reset their server, after which the raid continued for a few more hours on Habbo servers in other countries, particularly the German Habbo Hotel (where the nigras would form in swastika patterns). The Habbo raid is often considered /b/'s best and spawned the "Nigra" meme and the "Pool's closed" meme. The word "AIDS" was later wordfiltered on Habbo as a result of the raid.</li>
<li>July 15 - A sticky is made on /b/ in which "Also Sprach Zarathustra" by composer Richard Strauss (2001: A Space Odyssey theme song) was embedded.</li>
<li>July 20 - moot announces that they will have a panel at Otakon 2006 from August 4-6 in Baltimore, Maryland, with enough seating capacity to allow 680 people compared to the 230 from Otakon 2005.</li>
<li>July 22 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.sage.moe/v/thread/1000000/">/v/ reaches 1M GET</a>, considered to be one of the greatest non-/b/ gets of all time. The GET was a picture of PONG, thus a very fitting get for /v/.</li>
<li>July 26 - /b/ receives a picture of a post on the Zelda Universe Forums, claiming that administrator StonyLonesome planned to launch a counterattack on 4chan with Habbo Hotel. Even though the post itself was found to have been fake, /b/ wasted no time in obliterating the forums until the admins had to shut it all down. Later, it was revealed that Captain Cornflake had started the raid, just like he did with the Zelda Guide Forums raid.</li>
<li>July 27 - One of the Zelda Universe mods taunts /b/ and unintentionally revitalizes their interest in fucking up Zelda Universe. The ZU Media Wiki is targeted, mostly by one Anon using an AutoHotKey script. Six hundred wiki pages are defaced. A second raid on the forum is planned for August 2, but ends up never happening despite many accounts being prepared.</li>
<li>Late July - Ten threads were stickied, taking up the entire first page of /b/, and the theme song from Inspector Gadget was embedded into /b/.</li>
<li>August 4 - Otakon 2006 starts and so does 4chan's panel. Many important 4channers are there, including moot, shut, Shii, and the apparent return of W.T. Snacks. An epic sermon was delivered by "Reverend" Lemmy Caution to spread the gospel of Raptor Jesus, and moot even created a new board, /con/ (Conventions), for people at the con to use, which was deleted a few hours after the con ended.</li>
<li>August 12 - The 4chan :codes: (words put between colons that are turned into smilies, like how posting :happy: would display a happy emoticon, for example) are released to the site. They are soon spammed all over the place, and threads are pruned extremely quickly.</li>
<li>August 16 - The Tom Green raids - Tom Green, an Canadian host in an Internet call in show, Tom Green’s House Tonight, gets massively prank called by /b/tards, who made him hold a paper with the work b written on, wear a wig, suffered an hour long of DESU spam and meme spouting such as “Do a barrel roll”. All these calls ended up clogging the lines and keeping actual fans from calling in. Green gets pissed enough that he announces on live TV: “thanks to you assholes this will no longer be a call in show”. The next show in line was GirlTalk, which also got raided by /b/. This raid is possible because neither shows screened their calls.</li>
<li>August 22 - A group of Anonymous go on a midnight raiding spree, eventually attracting tons (~100) of Anonymous to their posse in raid threads. They charged, destroying Proana.us (a pro-anorexia community), deleting all accounts on the site. After this (by now around 1:00 AM of August 23), they attempted to raid the myg0t forum, but the raid failed due to myg0t's massive size. Instead, they raided teenbabynet.org (not only furries, but teenage furries with diaper fetishes), locking the forum and rendering it totally unviewable by 10:00 AM. At around this time, they turned their attention to WikiFur, leaving it in complete disarray. With mods extremely worried, moot does something drastic around noon of August 23...</li>
<li>August 23 - The /b/-day - moot (in a somewhat justifiable fit of anger) posts a sticky (later referred to as the Bob Ross sticky, for he used an image of Bob Ross) announcing that anyone who posts illegal content will get you permabanned and possibly arrested, and that even people who REPLY to illegal threads will receive a two-week global ban, with the definition of "illegal threads" referring to CP, jailbait, personal info, and raids (some of /b/'s most cherished traditions). This led to a massive outcry due to the fact that this policy was technically introducing rules to /b/, whose main goal was to be a rule-free board. The sticky was deleted and replaced with a new sticky restating the policy, which was then de-stickied and re-stickied over and over by moot and some other mod, and, along with spamming from angry /b/tards, caused img.4chan.org to crash, leaving 14 boards, including /b/, /an/, /b/, /c/, /cm/, /g/, /k/, /m/, /o/, /p/, /r/, /s/, /t/, /v/, and /w/ inaccessible. A civil war broke out, with many /b/tards permanently leaving 4chan and taking up new homes at 7chan, IIChan, 2ch.ru, and 420chan. moot got rid of the policy very shortly afterwards due to the enormous backlash. However, img.4chan.org didn't return until August 25, two days later.  Eventually, it would be considered that the events of the /b/-day where a failure, because a week later /b/ was doing the same routine as if it never happened. On the rest of the Internet, however, this resulted in a massive increase of alternative image boards, like WTFux, 7chan, 2ch.ru and others where many banned users took an exodus to. This marked the rise of the /i/nsurgence, given that 7chan housed an /i/ board, long forbidden by moot, for the first time the /b/tard would orchestrate raids on an organized fashion. Images for reference <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://i.imgur.com/k2OMPbe.jpg">here</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://i.imgur.com/6NHBE1k.jpg">here</a>.</li>
<li>September 4 - World-famous Australian "croc hunter" Steve Irwin is killed by a stingray barb to the heart while filming a documentary. /b/ is immediately flooded with this information and one of the first threads to announce it was stickied for a week, becoming the most replied-to thread in /b/ history with slightly over 5,200 replies (later beaten by the "#fortune" sticky on April 27, 2007). Many Rule 34s and general parodies are posted in /b/ during that time.</li>
<li>September 11 - Habbo, Revisited - In response to Steve Irwin's death, the fifth anniversary of 9/11, and hatred for Habbo Hotel, /b/, led by AFRODUCK, starts another massive raid on Habbo, with around 5,000 Anonymous partaking in the raid (~600 nigras on the Pool Deck alone). They blocked every single room, announcing that not only did the pool have AIDS, but also had stingrays as well. The raid continued for 3 days until September 14.</li>
<li>September 18 - The first instance of the infamous "Dirty Bomb" copypasta is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.sage.moe/b/thread/13046676/#13046676">posted to /b/</a>.</li>
<li>September 25-26 - Epic Fail Guy, in its original incarnation, is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.sage.moe/b/thread/13358472/">first posted to /b/</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://i.imgur.com/TBecZBc.jpeg">[1]</a>. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.sage.moe/b/thread/13358472/#13359738">Rule 34</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://i.imgur.com/sxYDouM.gif">Guy Fawkes mask</a> were posted, creating a well-received thread with only a few describing it as a forced meme. The original name of the character in the thread was <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.sage.moe/b/thread/13358472/#13359497">"Epic Failure Man"</a>. In another one of these threads, the first instance of "Epic Fail Guy" <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.sage.moe/b/thread/13386715/#13388797">was posted</a>. This name was mostly cemented by the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.sage.moe/b/thread/13422498/#13422628">next day</a>. Somewhat ironically, some stated that EFG was the first "win" meme in a while. Part of the appeal was that it was, essentially, a forced meme, that "tries as hard as he fails".</li>
<li>October 1 - /b/ celebrates its third anniversary, and places blue-and-pink striped party hats on the top of each thread. /b/tards made pictures interacting with the hats, causing many threads that are epic win (a good chunk of epic thread screencaps are from this day). Dan makes a second commemoration.</li>
<li>October 12 - The first instance of the love and waffles/*~t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m~* copypasta is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.sage.moe/b/thread/13948193/">posted on /b/</a>.</li>
<li>October 20 - Jake Brahm turns himself in to authorities following a now-infamous copypasta that he had written, reposting it around 40 times within the previous 30 days, in which he warned of simultaneous terrorist attacks against seven football stadiums across the United States on October 22nd. Two days before this, on October 18, the Department of Homeland Security was notified about the copypasta and attempted to track down and arrest the creator of it; when the Wauwatosa, Wisconsin police department (Brahm's town of residence) received a tip on October 20, he turned himself in and faces up to 20 years imprisonment, thus making him the only person to have been party v&amp; for his actions as of 2007. The phrase "DON'T MESS WITH FOOTBALL", uttered by FBI agent Les Wiser during a news report on Brahm's arrest, has since become a meme, and was briefly added to teh rules for /b/.</li>
<li>October 30 - Habbo, Revisited 2 or the Habbo fail raid - Somewhere around 100 nigras gather around Habbo Hotel, but are banned quickly.</li>
<li>November 7 - After moot doesn't pay the bills, the site goes down for two days, during which a page was put up explaining that the servers were gone because moot didn't pay and that the problem would be fixed within "24-48 hours" (crossed out with "FIFTY-BILLION YEARS" written next to it). Many /b/tards, looking for a temporary *chan to go to until 4chan returns, cause a major spike in traffic for other *chans as /b/tards go there temporarily. 7chan and 12chan were destroyed by the flood of traffic and suffered severe downtime.</li>
<li>November 21 - /b/space day - A /b/tard loads a keylogger on a public PC and gives /b/ over 40000 MySpace accounts and passwords. Of course, they proceed to have a field day over it.</li>
<li>November 30 - moot announces that more banner ads from AdBrite will be added to 4chan in December due to the fact that donations are no longer possible. As a result of the extra money, 4chan becomes faster after moot uses the money for extra bandwidth capacity.</li>
<li>December 9 - /sp/ is deleted. Pissed off users flock to /b/ to demand /sp/'s release to no avail.</li>
<li>December 20 - Hal Turner, a white supremacist talk show host from New Jersey, plans his final radio show due to lack of funding, in which he takes calls for three hours straight. However, a combined surprise raid from 4chan, 7chan, YTMND, Something Awful, and Bantown destroyed Hal's show, with 150 prank calls being made in three hours, with almost none of his real listeners being able to call in due to clogged lines. Hal then posts the phone numbers of the callers on his website (some of which were minors), sparking a huge outrage among /b/. Bantown then uncovered his personal information, including his real phone number, after which ~160 calls were made to his house. Hal gave in and removed the phone numbers from his site, but as we all know, Anonymous does not forgive. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://turnerchan.blogspot.com/">[2]</a></li>
<li>December 25 - Hal Turner spends Christmas with his family over at his father's house; news of this spread, and Bantown quickly found his father's number, leading to a massive amount of calls and Hal supposedly being kicked out of the house. After this, Hal claimed that the FBI was investigating 4chan (an Anonymous later called in to Hal's show claiming that he had contacted the FBI and that they had said that no such investigation was taking place) and redirected his website to the FBI page. Also, on this day the famous "The stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood. Only a fool would take anything posted here as fact." text was added below the /b/ board title, which itself was changed to "/b/ - A Christmas Story" for the holidays. This was probably done in relation to the Jake Brahm dirty bomb copypasta (of the "Don't mess with Football" fame).</li>
<li>December 31 - A happy ending for 2006 after Hal Turner surrenders to 4chan after much raiding and lulz, and announces that he is almost off of the internet completely. He announces, "I am not certain where to go from here. My entire existence - short of my physical presence on this planet - has been utterly wrecked, by people I never met from places I've never been." Anonymous knocks back a cold one and lols heartily. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070107054433fw_/http://poolsclosed.nexisonline.net/news.php">[3]</a></li></ul>

<ul><li>January 3 - Hal Turner’s third radio show gets dropped midsession allegedly because a hacker called Slogh held a grudge against him, and launched a botnet to DDOS the site.</li>
<li>January 5 - Hal Turner redirects his website to the FBI for a while in an effort to deter trolls.</li>
<li>January 9 - moot posts on the front page, announcing that 4chan would soon have interstitial ads due to dwindling revenue. moot also allows all of the trial boards created on April 6, 2006 (except /sp/, which got canned a month prior) to become full boards.</li>
<li>January 10 - All text disappears on /b/, with users only being able to talk through pictures or the E-mail field. Needless to say, this was win, and caused /b/ to be fag-free for a few hours.</li>
<li>January 22 - Hal Turners has enough and deletes his site.</li>
<li>January 24 - Ian, owner of 7chan, gets a notice from his host saying that the board /i/ violates the TOS. He deletes it. Meanwhile, Hal Turner gets kicked from his datacenter, and on the way to get a new way crashes his car.</li>
<li>January 27 - The great chan death of January 2007 - 4chan has a power failure and dies in the usual manner, however, so do all the other major imageboards of the Internet. 420chan was kicked out of hosting, 12 was suspended by the FBI, 2ch.ru died for unknown reasons, and 7chan couldn’t handle the influx of all the users bases put together and crashed. Even wikichan went down, never to return.</li>
<li>February 1 - Hal surrenders and claims to quit the internet. However that statement got the New York Times and a couple of watchers interested so he had more money for funding-.</li>
<li>February 10 - Hal Turner redirects his own site to 420chan.org and claims the “Canadian Communist” Kirtaner hacked him. However a WHOIS search showed the truth.</li>
<li>February 12 - Hal gets his page back.</li>
<li>February 15 - Two new boards are added: <b>/tg/</b> (Traditional Games) and <b>/x/</b> (Paranormal), the latter being created due to the popularity of 7chan's /x/ board and a rising creepypasta culture on /b/. moot also announces the winners in a contest for new banners.</li>
<li>February 16 - Janitor applications are opened and then closed four days later, with the new janitors being implemented around early March.</li>
<li>March 7 - Hal makes another radio show, anonymous raids him again. He dedicated the show about the 21/4 raid.</li>
<li>March 21 - Anonymous discovers photos of 16-year-old Kelly Isenhower of Georgia sucking off her dog, as well as her phone number and address. Needless to say, Anon went batshit, raiding her DeviantArt and MySpace, calling her parents and telling them about the incident, and even e-mailing the photographs to her school principal, although she was adamant that the photos were shopped (which they obviously weren't). She was suspended from school indefinitely, her dog was taken away, and everyone now hates her, including all her former friends and her parents. Anonymous rejoices.</li>
<li>March 26 - The Great re/b/oot - moot announces a re/b/oot and aims to restore /b/ to its former glory. Two stickies are created, one being a letter moot received that inspired him to start the re/b/oot, and another sticky being his formal apology for "letting /b/ turn to shit". /b/'s background changed to a seizure-inducing flashing yellow and white background with the song "Cotton-Eyed Joe" embedded in the background. The Name and Subject fields return to /b/, effectively ending forced anonymous and allowing tripcodes. Many people were banned by moot in both stickies for comments such as "/b/ sucks", and in many other threads as well. Later, a third sticky was made which was a locked thread with only two posts, with the OP announcing that he was "afraid of being banned by the crazy bitch-ass mods" and also said, "You might as well make rules for /b/ now faggots", followed by which the poster was banned. Later in the day, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.sage.moe/b/thread/23000000/">23M GET was achieved</a>, which was a picture of a Pokemon with text InfernalRape with the post consisting of INFERAPEGET. Considering this to be an extreme failGET (as did all of /b/), moot banned the poster, instantly transforming it into a winGET.</li>
<li>March 27 - Transmission - The next day, /b/'s title changes to “Transmission” with Trans italicized and the background turned /b/lack, and techno music was played, specifically “You could easily have me” by Motronomy. A sticky was posted containing a picture of Diglet and said, "/b/ is /b/ again". Many users were banned in the thread for suggesting otherwise.</li>
<li>March 28 - Revolution - /b/'s title changed to “Revolution” and the background was changed yet again to gray with red tripcodes (allowing users to impersonate moot every easily), techno music was added with the prominent line, "I am the creator". A sticky was posted in which a user was banned for posting DSFARGEG.</li>
<li>March 29 - Showdown - The day after that, the title was Showdown and the background was changed to a rapidly flashing rainbow background, as well as the posts. A techno version of the song "Eye of the Tiger” with elements from “Let Your Backbone Slide”, called “Tiger Said Knock You Out” by Neon Kobra, was added as background music. Four stickies were created, each with a GIF of a rainbow-flashing number 5 and the four stickies contained one line each of the song's opening verse (This is a showdown/A throwdown/Hell no, I can't slow down/It's gonna go). Also, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/EgpcM">the first known instance of a Rickroll occurs on this day, on /v/,</a> the bait-and-switch placeholder was the Grand Theft Auto IV reveal.</li>
<li>March 30 - Intermission - The next day, /b/ returned to normal, with a normal layout and no background music, during which /b/'s title was changed to "Intermission".</li>
<li>April 1 - Following two days of normal /b/, techno music was again added as background music, but the CSS remained unchanged, signaling the end of the re/b/oot.</li>
<li>April 20 - 4chan administrators are forced to temporarily shut down img.4chan.org after a thread containing four uncensored images of child pornography became stuck on the front page for over an hour (during which nobody could post) and could not be deleted due to MySQL problems. Rather than getting v&amp;, the plug was pulled on img.4chan.org and was restored around 12-15 hours later. During the downtime, since 7chan was down as well, a massive amount of /b/tards flocked to 420chan, thus ruining 420chan's most special day, 4/20.</li>
<li>April 21 - Hal Turner fail IRL raid - Hal Turned hyped the shit out of a supposed IRL raid, called two cop units, and ambulance and various friends. Only four channers, two anons and two girls (Or traps?) came in.</li>
<li>April 27 - "Fortunes" are introduced to /b/, a feature that moot had implemented from the very beginning but had <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.sage.moe/b/thread/25586562/#25587570">never told anyone about</a>. Basically, if you put your name as "#fortune", you will get a random fortune at the top of your post, chosen at random. moot announced it to the public after another mod told him to reveal it, causing mass spamming of fortunes. A thread in which someone guessed their own fortune was stickied and became the most replied-to thread in /b/ history up to that point, beating the Steve Irwin thread in just 19 hours with 5,336 posts.</li>
<li>April 28 - Subeta raids - 4chan, 7chan, and especially 420chan combine forces to attack Subeta, a faggot role-playing website similar to Gaia who stole Longcat and turned him into an item for their faggoty site. When the chans complained, Subeta DDoSed 420chan, leaving it in ruins and sticking Kirtaner (420chan's owner) with a $6,000 server bill. The *chans then DDoS Subeta, which they find hard to do due to lack of effort, as well as Subeta's 2000 GB monthly bandwidth and lack of large images. Nevertheless, two major Subeta fansites were shut down permanently and Subeta was down for two days. Keith (Subeta's owner) eventually apologized and removed Longcat from his site after a long and bloody battle, at which many Anonymous rejoiced. On this same day, Encyclopedia Dramatica, one of /b/'s most famous recruiting posts, encountered a severe hard disk failure and does not return until June 8.</li>
<li>May 13 - moot changes /b/'s layout so that everything is the same color (excluding checkboxes and fortunes), meaning that users will have to press Ctrl+A (Select All) or disable CSS in order to view text. A sticky is posted in which moot explains that the color change is to keep stupid people out, which moot closed a few hours later at around 1,900 posts. moot <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.sage.moe/b/thread/27050709/#27050899">also announced</a> that threads would go back to the limit of 250 posts and 100 images instead of 1000 posts and 500 images, so that topics can be pruned easier and that the directory dumper would be harder to abuse. The color change lasted a week (during which posting rates decreased by 10%) after which it was disabled, triggering some anger from some /b/tards who wished that the cancer could have been kept out longer.</li>
<li>June 5 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.sage.moe/co/thread/1000000/">/co/ reaches 1M GET</a>; the thread disappears within five seconds or so, and due to the strain on the server, the file was deleted as soon as it was uploaded. The post also had the text, "reducto get", referring to Reducto from Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, meaning that the picture was most likely one of him.</li>
<li>June 6 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.sage.moe/b/thread/29000000/">/b/ reaches 29M GET</a>, which the original poster deletes after three hours after being persuaded to do so in another thread.</li>
<li>June 16 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.sage.moe/b/thread/30000000/">30M GET</a> is achieved one hour after midnight, when many /b/tards are asleep. It was an extreme failGET, as was 10M GET and 20M GET. Consisting of the text "Shit. Getting closer" and a picture from some anime, it received around 2400 replies before being deleted 15 hours later.</li>
<li>June 18 - moot brings back forced Anonymous on /b/ after someone insults him. Many think it is merely a temporary change, and they were right. The forced Anonymous remains in place for just over a month.</li>
<li>June 22 - On /x/, the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/QD9UF">first SCP thread</a> is posted, quickly becoming a phenomenon on the board and a sub-culture outside of 4chan.</li>
<li>July 12 - The Great Habbo Raid of July 2007 - Commemorating one year of the most epic raid ever done, /b/ sets out to raid Habbo hotel once again. This time, the mods decide that “If you can’t beat them, join then” via declaring international Afro day. However this resulted in racist implications. There were many complains about the raid, mainly coming from lack of organization, but everyone agrees it was just as funny as the last year. At the same time, Tom Green makes a midnight show, completely drunk, and gets one single prank call from the anons. He spends the rest of the show shouting BARREL ROLL and MUDLIFFS at every caller, ended up closing the show half an hour earlier.</li>
<li>July 17 - Anonymous raids potterforums.com via spam bots with the spoilers for Harry Potter’s seventh book. They manage to close the site down temporarily.</li>
<li>July 20 - Sometime around 5:40 P.M. EDT, forced anonymous is turned off again. No reason is given at the time, nor is a sticky posted. It is later revealed that moot turned it off at the urging of the other 4chan staffers, all of whom were going to Otakon.</li>
<li>July 21 - The Great Deathly Hallows IRL Raid of 2007 - /b/ gets a leak of Harry Potter’s seventh book, obtained from Gaia (Ha!) and proceed to spoiler it for everyone else.</li>
<li>July 23? - /b/'s background music is changed to a remix of "Chocolate Rain" by Tay Zonday.</li>
<li>July 26 - The Fox News Report - HACKERS ON STEROIDS - Fox News makes what is the probably most hilariously retarded act of journalism in history. Covering anonymous and internet hackers in ways completely irrelevant, such as showing the footage of an exploding van and that a mother whose sons' MySpace account got hacked and took to defensive measures such as buying a dog. They coined many memes such as HACKERS ON STEROIDS, INTERNET HATE MACHINE, buy a dog, exploding van and lulz, a corruption of lol. While that's all happening, /b/ returns to the Zelda Universe Forums for a one-year anniversary raid. The server control panel password is bruteforced (it was 'apassword11') and /b/ takes over the entire forum, removing their mod team, fucking with the CSS, and then redirecting users to the Last Measure site to turn their browsers and computers to toast. Before the hosting account is suspended, /b/ blanks the homepage and puts a Stalin and Lenin Flash up in its place.</li>
<li>July 27 - /b/ raids the shit out of Fox News, spamming MyFoxLA and MyFoxDC forums until the admins deleted them, getting into a completely unprotected FoxNews.com and stealing the personal info 1.5 million users from ZiffDavis.com via a UNIX script, all blaming whilst eBaumsWorld. Other Anonymous IRL raided the Fox News LA Studio by ordering pizzas, male hookers and fast food and many others things. This raid would have happened the same day but, for a weird reason, no new threads could be created on /b/ during that day.</li>

<li>October 19 - 25 - The Caturday Nap - A number of users from Lulznet enter the 4chan IRC channel, demanding that it be moved from its current location on irc.rizon.net to irc.partyvan.org. Their request is not taken seriously and they are banned from the channel in short order. During the exchange, moot said “whatever, Im gonna go make soup”. Angered, Lulznet beings a DDoS attack against 4chan. The attack is relatively successful, with all of the 4chan servers’ timing out relatively quickly, in response moot simply plugs them out. Simultaneously, Encyclopedia Dramatica attacks Wikichan for the sake of it.</li>
<li>October 20 - With 4chan off the map, /b/tards flock to 7chan and other sites, as usual. 7chan’s server cannot take this much traffic and wavers in and out of service. 420chan enters partyhard mode to keep the site out of /b/tards.</li>
<li>October 21 - A 7chan mod decides it’s enough and attaches an upgraded version of partyhard.css to /b/, sending everything to hell. Later they decide to DDOS Lulznet, they fail and Lulznet brings them down, having their host null them for a while.

<li>October 22 - /b/tards and /i/nsurgents gather at Freechan and begin to plan a counter attack. The surge of users puts the site down for fifteen minutes and the OP of the invasion threads gets banned due to fear of Lulznet retaliation.

<li>October 24 - They find the Lulznet IRC and DDOS the shit out of them. moot finally runs out of soups and 4chan and /b/ are back with a new meme called brb, soup. The 4chan status page is created.</li>
<li>October 26 - No Cussing Club raid - /b/ decided to raid a kids club that, as the name suggests, was against swearing and somehow managed to get the praise of a governor.

<li>October 29 - Two hours before Zelda Universe has its weekly backup, anons raid the site, take over a few admin accounts, sending admin access to anybody who asked, renaming the site to Desu Universe, and obliterating the forums once more.

In the many years following, KoG would go from predicting 5's to dubs, trips, quads and eventually major GETs using images of yugi or cirno.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/KingofGETs/videos">[4]</a></li>

<li>December 14 - BRB, compromised - IDIDITFORTHELULZ.net obtains moot’s domain password, hereby taking control of 4chan by having CeLe, owner of Glexia.com, 4chan’s hosting, hand them over. CeLe was a good friend of DIDITFORTHELULZ’s admin, XyriX. Together with his team [Lulz] and his girlfriend Angyl they tried to make a “4chan for the people”. There is a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.org/details/moot-angyl-transcript-4chan-domain-hijacked_202111">recorded phone conversation</a> where Angyl tries to get a fansign picture of a very angry moot in exchange for giving them the site back. Glexia suspended 4chan’s and teamdouche’s (Angyl’s former team) accounts after they Dox’d Angyl together with Anonymous Borg (Locutus_of_loli, actor in the Caturday Nap). Why they helped, its unknown. moot got the site back after he gave the ransom. I wonder where the pictures are.</li>
<li>December 21 - The FBI makes reports the arrest of Trey Burba in their website, showing that they really don’t have any idea of how /b/ works.</li>
<li>December 30 - Hal Turner announces that he is closing his site. In a last moment, 7channers and anons from #insurgency tell the g00ns, who used their actual hacker skills to steal all the data regarding donations and subscribers. It turns out Hal made more money from the former than the latter. Plus that bandwidth totaled way less than he told.</li></ul>

<li>March 6 - Tom Green gets raided again. This time anons called, asking him to do stuff like a successful gentlemen re-enactment, time-stamping his hand and finally gets an anon who decides to shout FAT NIGGER six times until he’s cut. Around here was when the infamous raid channel #tomgreen was born. Janitor applications go live.</li>
<li>March 17 - Another Tom Green raid, he befriends a caller on Skype and decides to let him on and call another caller. The first one was cut short because he began to shout FAT NIGGER, now a Tom Green classic. The second one asked him to do a Barrel Roll and the third one put on a Guy Fawkes mask and began to masturbate vigorously. Another called brought up his issue with Drew Baltimore.</li>

<li>May 2 - /b/-day 2 - Out of curiosity, moot decides to turn /b/ off for one day. The ensuing wave of adrift /b/tards, with no place to go since 7chan was pretending to be bought by 4chan, redirecting to the site, they flocked at /r9k/. There, they discovered that they could impersonate moot, and decided to flood the shit out of everything. As the day progressed more and more /b/tards drifted towards the other boards, mainly /r9k/, /k/, /s/ and /x/.</li>
<li>May 22 - Operation Jewtube - In response to protests from My Chemical Romance fans regarding criticism of the band, /i/nsurgents from Britchan troll the media by making videos about the protest, adding a final note telling that they were going to kill themselves at the end.</li>

The image might really have been something else put as "image deleted" and replaced with the Cory cover by a mod after the fact.</li>
<li>June 13 - 4chan's /b/ got spammed with obfuscated JavaScript code (henceforth known as 4chan.js) with the simple instructions. In reality, it effectively turns your computer into a botnet. The server is almost fucked by the load of hundreds of botnets until the mods manage to filter the text and delete all threads containing the instructions.</li>
<li>June 14 - The 4chan.js script from the previous day is modified to dodge the filter, and spam starts anew. Meanwhile, the ability to roll dice is added to /tg/ with an <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.sage.moe/tg/thread/1991877/">announcement directly from moot</a>.</li>
<li>June 15 - moot steps in to crack down on the 4chan.js scriptfags. The text string "eval(" is automatically filtered and users who post it are handed a 15 day ban. Also, for some reason, moot adds more word filters such as replacing "femanon" with "cumdumpster." /b/tards troll newfags by making threads such as "eval (now wordfilters to niggerjews)", getting many retards banned for two weeks.</li>
<li>June 18 - The old /b/ day and the Boston fail meet up - /b/'s title was changed as well to old /b/, the love Theme from Metal Gear Solid 4 is embedded with the subtitle “/b/ has changed. it's no longer about original content, epic GETs, and win it's an endless series of reposts, perpetuated by newfags and trolls fail - and its consumption of /b/, has become an unstoppable cancer. /b/ has changed." and “This is our final mission” was written on the announcements. Before, the title/ has already been renamed /vaporeon/," "/tom/" and "/b/oston." The board was later locked, and unlocked with two stickies. Confused /b/tards though this was it, /b/ was going to be deleted and vowed to at least try to kill the cancer, the cancerous threads became “One last X” threads and other vowed to delete their /b/ folder. However, on other boards, a small text appeared: "today, 6/18. Boston common. park street. 7pm.". By 7PM, a link to an USTREAM video was posted on all the boards. moot successfully tricked all the newfags for 4chan to see.</li>
<li>June 25 - The SOHH raids - In response of taunts from the JGO (Just Buggin’ Out) forum, /b/ decides to raid the rap site SOHH. They infiltrate the forums, pish accounts and exploit vBulletin until they get admin passwords. They deface the site and eventually DDoS the forums and later the site. The rest of SOHH’s userbase flocked to other site like AllHipHop and /b/ also destroyed them.</li>
<li>July 10 - a /b/tard spamming “Google &amp;#21328” “See results” manages to make /b/ get the swastika appear on Google trends.</li>
<li>July 11 - The Great Habbo Raid of July 2008 -Following the tradition, plans were already in motion to raid Habbo Hotel once again. This time the action was located in Canada. However many /b/tards raided one day earlier with the excuse of reconnaissance. Though they managed many swastigets the mods eventually retaliated,</li>
<li>July 12 - /b/tards all over the *chans joined in Habbo Canada to raid. The zerg rush was absolute and very unorganized, even though the veteran nigras made tools for the newfags. The Canadian moderation was more reactionary than the American and banned nigras back and forth. At the same time, in an effort against</li>
<li>July 13 - In an effort against scientology, /b/tard search bomb Google to make “scientology is a cult” top Google Trends. Later they change it to an Upside-down “fuck you Google”</li>
<li>July 16 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220110183923/https://archived.moe/a/thread/13323979/">KoG announces a retirement from GETs. He doesn't actually commit to that.</a></li>
<li>July 21 - The Chanopocalypse - Three users from Raidchan, Pacifico, ViraL and f have the idea to start an imageboard civil war; their attempts fail as they were discovered, so they decide to go nuts and DDOS every major imageboard on the net.</li>

<li>August 7 - 4chan's DNS servers were down and it was not restored until August 11 2008.</li>
<li>August 19 - The 4chan.js script returns and retards continue to fall for it. /b/ is brought to its knees once more. One of the script posts also steals the 81M GET.</li>
<li>August 22 - One of the most notorious Tom Green Raids. Tom Green decided to challenge his users to play “the game” - As long as his view count never dropped he would keep taking calls. #tomgreen began to call for /b/lackup on 4chan, 7chan, 420chan and many other sites, and soon the view counts tripled. Botnets were assembled to create fake views and cries of FAT NIGGERS flowed from the phone. Tom Green lost it, shouted “Fuck you, man” at the last caller, torn the phone cable, shouted “PHONES ARE BULLSHIT” whilst leaving and closed the show with a final “See ya, pricks”. Anonymous gave the coup de grace by DDOSing the server. The 4chan.js script is modified cleverly, this time the code is hidden in a .gif image and instructions are given to newfags, telling them to save the picture as 4chan.js and open the file. More bricks are shat, /b/ is fucked again.</li>
<li>August 26 - The 4chan.js script first appears as a .jse (Microsoft-obfuscated version of .js) file. Two days later, the 4chan.js script first appears as a .hta file.</li>
<li>August 29 - Another spam scripts gets hold of b taunting people to come to their house for some reason.</li>
<li>August 31 - Another 4chan.js script appears which now copies files from your My Documents folder and implements them in the .gif files. Essentially, if you save the script like a tard, you've just had your documents uploaded to 4chan.</li>
<li>September 10 - Positron Uprising - The Large Hadron Collider was starting today, and moot changed /b/ title to Positron Uprising, with a subtitle of “I, for one, salute our new proton spiral overlords - ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH” And embedded Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagan’s theme on /b/. Every single post is wordfiltered to “ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH”. A small, clickable fyi link appears under the comment field, which leads to a giant. /b/ proceeds to evacuate the board and raids the fuck out of /trv/ and various other boards. The next stop was /v/, but the raid was met with strong retaliation. Eventually this inspired /v/ tripfag 3 Angled Blue to make the Rage Vs. Cancer comic depicting the civil war, and it got such a rise in popularity that /v/irgins got together and made the popular V-rage flash. 3AB then made a sequel comic and an unfinished conclusion in flash.</li>
<li>September 16 - /b/tard David Kernel hacks into Sarah Palin’s email by guessing the secret questions, looking to derail his campaign. However he’s scared of being discovered and posts the password on /b/ under the name of Rubico. Subsequently, another user changes the password and posts a screencap, but forgets to censor it. Besides getting labeled a white knight, the account gets the password changed a third time, but due to Yahoo policy it gets locked. Rubico essentially showed /b/ all the information necessary to get v&amp;, including his email, his American Proxy. moot gets called into court to testify against David.</li>
<li>September 17 - Rubico posts his story of how he did it, it immediately becomes a copypasta. The news get on the old media and an Internet poll held by Fox News’s host Greta Van Susteren over the issue, asking what the users though about the incident, if it was a harmless prank or a political move. Anonymous was aware of this and immediately clicked the prank option. However when the polls turned to 67% in favour of the prank the host claimed they got hacked. After the show was over they rigged the poll so you could no longer select the prank option. 4chan then proceeded to spam the comments section. A thread erupts laughing at how moot will get v&amp; because of it, and moot responds by changing the title to “/b/ - DESPICABLE, SLIMMY, SCUMMY” with the subtitle “Remix”. He then embedded a remix of Row Row Fight the Powah.</li>
<li>September 20 - Rubico gets arrested and his house is investigated. It ends up he’s the son of Democratic Tennessee State Representative Mike Kernell. /b/ attempts to DDOS and Raid Bill O’Reily, who was dissing the site at the time but they fail to incite any reaction.</li>

<li>October 7 - The second grand jury of Kernel’s case. moot had to go and testify about 4chan. - /b/ goes down due to script kiddies. /b/tards flood /x/, /d/, /v/ and /n/. /k/ strikes a counter-offensive.</li>
<li>October 27 - 4chan.js is revived again. It apparently fails.</li>
<li>November 4 - /b/'s title changed to RON PAUL 2008 and then to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://i.imgur.com/OViib3t.jpg">O/b/ama - Your new supreme overlord</a> for the elections.</li>
<li>November 6 - The ultimate 4chan.js script hits 4chan. This time, the script takes a rusty dildo and fucks literally every single board up, even the poor bastards at /i/. Mass bans are handed out to combat the spam.</li>
<li>November 27 - A variation of 4chan.js, known as lol.js, appears on /b/. This time, running the script downloads something a copy of the script from Rapidshare and runs it on /b/. Technically speaking, this version of 4chan.js is an actual virus.</li>
<li>November 30 - /b/ hits 100M GET, featured a furry image by artist Strype. This iconic action on this day would shortly thereafter be labeled as the day of "Epic Fail".</li>
<li>December 12 - Anontalk.org spams /b/. /b/ begins to plan a retaliation. Hal Turner meanwhile tried to convince anonymous to hack into the Federal Reserve and get him some dox.</li>
<li>December 13 - The day /b/ died - /b/ and a coalition of *chans and related raids AnonTalk during Operation AntFuck, fed off with his endless spam. At the same time /b/ gets spammed to death by Raidchan with KORAX &gt; YOU and KAYLA &gt; YOU. Somehow, this actually makes most people leave and those who stayed claimed that the boards quality got better.</li>
<li>December 27 - Prelude to Boxxy - 4chan was due for unknown reasons, and on 7chan’s /b/, now roaring with 4chan’s /b/tards, a video of a strangely tantalizing teenager was embedded under the name of FOAR 4DD1 FRUM BOXXY.</li></ul>

<ul><li>January 1 - The great No Cussing Club Raid - /b/tards chan-wide IRL raid McKay, creator of the No Cussing Club by sending him porn magazines, pizza and death threats. On 4chan, /b/ was back, and the boxxy video was the subject of many “You rage, you lose” and “You fall in love, you lose” threads. Opinions on boxxy where divided, and conflicted, submerging the board in a flame war. Enraged newfags and oldfags spammed her comments section and days later boxy closed her Youtube channel, boxybabe.</li>
<li>January 7 - Boxxy discovers her fans and decides to lurk /b/. There, she posted two pics of herself, but was called out as a fake, to prove her pictures; she made a second account, boxybabee, and uploaded a third video acknowledging /b/. At that point, everything went to hell.</li>
<li>January 10 - Operation: Clampdown - Everything was going to hell. About 50% of the threads on /b/ where about boxxy. Pissed of, the “faction”, those who did not care, planned to DDOS the site the next day.</li>
<li>January 11 - The Boxxy civil war - The boxxy situation escalated to the point where anonymous planned to DDOS /b/ at 00:00 GMT. Shortly after the mods blocked all posting claiming the img server was down for maintenance. Following this, saying Boxxy becomes insta-ban.</li>

<li>January 18 - A group of name fags called the CBRC (Center for Boxxy Control and Restriction) hacked into Boxxy’s channel by guessing the password change question after hacking her email. They privatized all her videos and uploaded one claiming that Boxxy will never upload a video again, holding her d0x hostage. This would be considered a win, however they proceeded to brag about their deeds on the comment section and nobody liked that.</li>
<li>January 19 - Realizing this, they spread her d0x and uploaded a second video attempting, and failing, to claim that they did not do it for fame.</li>
<li>January 20 - Seeing that their infamy wouldn’t do anything else than rise, they decided to shut down the organization and revert the account due to troll’s remorse.</li>
<li>January 21 - McKay’s father, Brent Hatch’s email gets hacked. It’s discovered that in fact, No Cussing Club was the parent’s idea and profits from it. Leaking this info effectively ruined the club.</li>

<li>January 28 - "After four months of being ad-free, we're running some ad tests. We ask that you bear with us as we filter out the shitty ads and see what works. Also, please don't block them, and be sure to click those that interest you. Thanks!"</li>
<li>February 1 - /a/ is brutally raped by 4chan.js, this time the .gif squares are now in all sorts of colors. /r9k/ gets buttfucked the next day.</li>
<li>February 5 - The script fucks /b/ again with a sea of glorious red squares. On Caturday that month (which Caturday, we don't know), 4chan.js instructions tell newfags that they can use them to get to the sekrit raid board, /z/. It's /b/, so /b/ does what /b/ does and fucks itself. Those who escape the carnage take refuge on /x/ and shit up that board instead.</li>
<li>March 2 - Yet another Tom Green Raid. Tom is having a party with some friends, David Faustino and Corin Nemec. #tomgreen called pizzaland and ordered $79 worth of pizza. Tom actually likes the prank and closes the show whilst eating pizza.</li>
<li>March 13 - A Dutch /b/tard announces his intention to go and kill people on the Brenda high school but is reported to the FBI. Europe, who had a high school massacre in Germany two days before, responds immediately. He gets arrested and his house is searched. He claimed that everything was a joke.</li>
<li>March 15 - Another Dutchfag decided to do the same in Rotterdam too, however he was under seven proxies so the city of Rotterdam closes all their schools the next day.</li>
<li>March 16 - The Dutch police decides to give him a two weeks detainment.</li>

<li>March 21 - Again, /b/ retaliates towards the endless AnonTalk spam with Operation AntFuck II.</li>
<li>March 24 - A Legendary thread is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120311073656/http://archives.yotsubasociety.org/4chan/b/126031778.html">stickied on /b/</a> full of copypasta based on a Batman Begins quote of the Joker saying "My Father...was a baker...and a friend".</li>
<li>March 30 - Tom Green finally snaps, he played an atonal saxophone during the whole show, keeping the audience watching with the expectation that he would eventually stop and take calls.</li>
<li>April 1 - He continues the act the next day and closes the show shouting obscenities followed by “I DON’T GIVE A FUCK”. Also, the font for /b/ was changed to Comic Sans, possibly as a April Fools day joke.</li>
<li>April 11 - Once again, /b/ decides to raid AnonTalk for a third tame, continuing the operation.</li>
<li>April 14 - 4chan.js returns, telling /b/ users to take a break from DESU DESU DESU spamming and copypastas. Surprise surprise, /b/ falls for it again and the board is assfucked by the colorful squares.</li>
<li>April 16 - Tom Green gets Sushi. He has a bunch of friends come to the house to party, with no Skype on the plans. Meanwhile, a tripfag under the name of BBQ orders 450 dollars’ worth of Sushi and every anon waits expectantly. Nothing happens until the end of the show, his door rings and we see a small cart with enough Sushi to feed a small family for a week comes in. However it seems he did not pay for the Sushi, because he’s seen eating a Hamburger at the end of the show.</li>
<li>April 17 - Kimmo makes a news post declaring that he won’t spam any longer. Anonymous declares victory. Two days later he goes full circle and the spam starts again.</li>
<li>April 21 - Tom Greens gets a camwhore on StickCam who immediately runs a loop of meatspin. Tom took a while to turn it off.</li>
<li>April 27 - 4chan related groups successfully hacked Time 2009's Person of the Year contest by rigging the candidates’ names with mARBLECAKEALSOTHEGAME. Time refuses to shallow pride and declare the poll valid, inviting moot to a Time magazine event, sparking a meme in the process.</li>
<li>May 5 - /b/ DDOS’s itself - /b/ and /r9k/ grinded to a halt by DDOS, everyone suspects 711chan is to blame. However it was later discovered that users downloaded an image that contained a DDOS script without realizing. The attack continued an entire week.</li>
<li>May 10 - 4chan's /b/ and /r9k/ was under a DDoS - The DDoS attack was caused by a trojan some /b/tards downloaded.</li>
<li>May 19 - YouTube Porn Day - /b/ - "...what would happen if ALL of us upload porn on YouTube non-stop?". /b/-tards planned the raid by uploading the porn in private videos with the tags marblecake, and released them all in the same day with the tag Marblecake. Even though the operation started too early due to timelines, Youtube was still clogged with porn, creating the memes “I’m 12 years old and what is this” and Marblecake.</li>
<li>May 29 - moot posts a sticky called "Re:spam" with an image titled crockofshit.png</li>
<li>June - 4chan.js returns with a vengeance, this time injecting the script into a random picture taken from your hard drive, then uploading it to 4chan. The script also dodges the wordfilters by removing random letters from the script posts. Mods apparently just gave up at this point.</li>
<li>June 1 - /b/ title changed to "Twilight Appreciation Station - The darkest place on the internet -- for vampire compatriots"</li>
<li>June 12 - Second Youtube Porn Day - Though a failure, the idea was to set them all to private without the original tag and make them public.</li>
<li>June 18 - A year after the events of the old /b/ day, /b/’s title changed to "you forgot - it was your final mission nothing will save you now." On the other boards, the meet up was scheduled at Washington Square, and this time, moot was there.</li>

<li>July 5 - /b/ DDOS’s itself 2: Electric Bogaloo - /b/ starts to be spammed as if there is no tomorrow. At first the suspected culprit was Blackhatworld.com, but eventually they concluded that the /b/tards where downloading infected images again. The script uploads a rainbow of coloured images of the main character of A Clockwork Orange. The attack spread to every damn board and lasted until July 8.</li>
<li>July 12 - moot makes a global announcement stating that he might use Twitter "(ugh)" for site updates in addition to other stuff. (Despite the initial feelings about twitter, he eventually learns to enjoy it.) . On the same day, /b/tards find a messageboard, “iheartboxxy”, a small group of users found two videos of Boxxy filmed by her friends attending the 2009 Spring California Thespin Festival. Regarding themselves as a council, one of the members got d0x and /b/ threatened to raid him if they did not show the videos. Eventually the admin of the website obliged and uploaded them.</li>
<li>July 23 - Jason Scott <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2083">announces</a> he has acquired an archive of over 10 million 4chan threads, which he plans to upload to archive.org over the next week.</li>

Given that this is the second time it happens, they found a chair on her front gates. They rang the bell but no one answered. They left some flowers in front of the gates with the word “Anon”. They later found her ex-boyfriend, Dan Birlen, though Boxxy never appeared. Over the months a new wave of pictures would appear, obtained by “Calif4nia”, an user of Killwebs.com, who got them by flirting with a friend of Boxxy, Niki, for months. He watermarked them with his site’s logo and blurred them. However, anonymous managed to fix the pictures and doxed callif4nia, whose team later shut down Killwebs.com.</li>
<li>July 27 - AT&amp;T blocks 4chan - moot attempts to reduce damage from having AnonTalk DDOS them with dire consequences: AT&amp;T blocks 4chan's /r9k/ and /b/ more specifically the img.4chan.org sub domain was blocked. The entire site rises in arm in retaliation, but the matter is soon cleared and the block lifted. moot used the opportunity to talk about Internet censorship. The blotter is removed.</li>

<li>August 10 - Moot releases the emails sent to him by Lanced Jack (annoying and infamous tripfag who avatarfagged as konata from lucky star) in which he pathetically begs for his rangeban to be removed. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/Fs762">The thread gets stickied.</a></li>
<li>August 20 - Tom Green runs another Skype show, with an anon offering to sings the FAT NIGGER song, the second anon puts on a charade for five minutes until finally fapping on camera, and the third anon gurgles cum on the air.</li>
<li>September - Gamespot.com hosted a tournament, where its users voted to decide who the greatest video game character of all time is. 4chan decided to trash this party. Anonymous decided to have Duke Nukem, Little mac and /b/ubble &amp; /b/bobble come out at the top. Especially /b/u/b/ &amp; /b/o/b/. At the first round of the tournament, bub &amp; bob were against the mighty master chief. Master Chief was no match for bub &amp; bob, since the Gamespot community wasn't prepared for a raid such as this. Much lulz was had, as bub &amp; bob, a game that most people haven't heard of defeated master chief. bub &amp; bob defeated sonic easily in the next round, and faced Samus in round 3. It was an incredibly tight match. Hackers from both sides pulled all-nighters. As a result, bub &amp; bob won with 53% of the votes. Sadly, the Gamespot admins disqualified bub &amp; bob because they caught 5 specific people who submitted 16K votes. bub &amp; bob won the battle, but Samus had won the war. Due to the raid, the word 4chan was banned from the Gamespot forums. The Gamespot community now refers to 4chan as mordor.</li>
<li>September 22 - 4chan.js returns with a barrage of scripts hidden in pictures of greyness, but mods counter it after 5 hours. Three days later, the script returns but now the pictures are brown. This attack ends up being much more successful, taking over /d/, /wg/, /r9k/, /x/, and a number of other useless boards.</li>
<li>October 1 - 4chan turned 6 years old. The party hats return once again. /b/ crashes due to delicious cake. As usual, /b/ flees to /x/. The server crashes twice more until all of 4chan.img is down. Mac makes his third commemoration.</li>

<li>December 10 - The Boxxy videos get taken down by somebody named Lia Dawson, claiming that Boxxy is a registered trademark of the Lia Dawson &amp; Frank Dawson Network.

However, user ChrissyRin ousted the scammers for what they were, hoping to attain money from the Youtube videos of Boxxy and other 20 Youtube accounts.</li>
<li>December 14 - The account gets reactivated but without any videos, which were restored days later. The Lia account was abandoned and later hacked into and suspended in January.</li>

<li>January 26 - The start of the longest ever collab thread in the history of 4chan on /3/. The last time I checked as of 3/17/2012 it was incomplete.</li>
<li>February - A sticky was created on /b/, where moot asked what he should mention for his presentation for TED Talks. The thread received over 12K posts. moot described anonymous to a bunch of confiscates in 70 different countries (wait until all those people go on 4chan, realizing that 4chan is dead and full of porn) on TED Talks. He claimed 4chan was dying due to the movement towards internet privacy. moot also reviled that he moved out of his mom's house and back to college.</li>
<li>February - Massive Q and A threads on /a/, /jp/, and /r9k/. moot created a formspring page for Q and A things but it was flooded with 20,000 messages. Around 2012 he quietly replaced the formspring page with the 4chan FAQ.</li>
<li>February 4 - Verizon users started experiencing problems loading 4chan. Soon moot confirmed with Verizon customer support that 4chan was blocked on purpose. Verizon took a week to "resolve" the situation</li>
<li>February 20 - /jp/ - Japan/General is officially renamed to /jp/ - Otaku Culture.</li>
<li>February 21 - 200M GET on /b/ featured an image of Ninetails, a Pokemon. On that same date, moot implemented post number truncation in response to the Bateman/Doubles Guy posts on /b/, but they simply moved to /a/ and /v/ to spread this cancer.</li>

<li>February 26 - HARMONY - A /v/irgin delves into the depths of Adult Swim’s flash section and finds a single game - Robot Unicorn Attack. The /v/irgin, felt something weird… something new. For the first time he actually liked a game. So he went to /v/ to tell the news.</li>
<li>February 27 - Robot Unicorn Attack invades the entirety of /v/ and leaks into /a/, /jp/, /co/, /m/. /tg/, /k/, /x/ and /mu/. Many tripfags contributed, MFGreth1 added it on wiki recommended games list, Gay Purple Man, began streaming the game, BaconShota made #robotunicornattack, lordofhet started a group on Steam. Hundreds of /v/irgins emailed moot asking him to embed the RUA theme - Always by Erasure - on /v/. And he complied. Surprisingly, the game wasn’t even mentioned on /b/, something the /b/tards didn’t like. This event, in its own small way, change the way /v/ reacted towards games, from the hate bandwagon to actually admitting what games they liked. This would be a perfect reflection of the cultural changes 4chan went through during 2010.</li>
<li>February 28 - "Over the past 48 hours 4chan's formspring page has gotten over 12,000 questions, and I've received over 3,000 e-mails. Many thanks to everyone who submitted a question, and sent me a message! I was able to respond to a few hundred e-mails and had hoped to start answering questions on formspring, but it seems that the number of questions broke the page. Once that's sorted out, I'll sift through them and answer as time allows. Thanks again for all of the support!" - However this fix never happened due to various reasons.</li>

<li>July 15 - Anonymous soon uncovered her personal information including phone number, address and her Twitter account. People soon began flooding the Leonhardt’ household with prank calls and hate e-mails. In a Stickam video uploaded on July 15th, Jessi is seen answering the phone during one of the prank calls. Following the relentless waves of harassment carried out by the trolls, Jessi posted a tearful response video on YouTube, in which her father Gene Leonhardt suddenly comes into the shot and delivers an angry rant. /vp/ gets another infamous sticky, this time featuring Bill. Its name also got changed to "/tr/ - Team Rocket" at some point in the future.

<li>July 21 - /b/ is told that Jessi Slaughter will appear on Good Morning America! the following day. /b/ panics, factions rise, one wanting to spam /b/ to keep off potential newfags and one wanting to make /b/ the complete opposite of what will be reported on the TV. The later faction won. Operation /b/ipolar begins.</li>
<li>July 22 - Operation /b/ipolar - /b/'s rules change, along with embedded music and a new sticky thread in "honor" of, ABC's Good Morning Coverage of Jessi Slaughter. /b/ was ready to for the income of new users thanks to Operation /b/ipolar, but in the end it never happened, Jessi wizens up and doesn’t mention 4chan.</li>
<li>July 23 - In the end, Good Morning America! did mention 4chan in the night shift airing, causing /b/ to panic again. But before it could re-start Operation /b/ipolar, a massive wave of spam crashes /b/. /b/tards flee to /a/ and later /x/, who welcomes them with open, ghostly arms.</li>
<li>July 24 - In response to the spam, moot awakes from his soup-induced hibernation and establishes reCAPTCHA for some minutes, but later removes it.</li>

<li>October 19 - An article titled <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/ideas-commentary/the-end-of-the-creator-driven-era-29614.html"><i>The End of the Creator-Driven Era in TV Animation</i></a> is posted to /co/. It receives widespread condemnation due to its alarmist tone and prompts more /co/mrades to ironically watch some of the shows mentioned therein, notably the new incarnation of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.</li>

Still it garnered enough users to catch the attention of the Tumblr user’s that browsed 4chan. It prompted them to start Operation Overkitten, flooding /b/ with actual pictures of kittens and the phrase “What is air”  . In response, /b/ attempts to DDOS Tumblr but fails, only taking the front page down. Tumblr declares victory and eventually, in the victory flood of /b/, a somewhat clear-headed user of /b/ proposes that, since 4chan is predominantly male, and Tumblr is predominantly female, should have sex with each other. Thus, 4chumblr is born, and a surprising amount of Tumblr girls began to post pics of themselves in you love you lose and tits threads.</li>

Many /b/tards flee to /x/ again, in a sort of tradition. After so many times having /x/ handle /b/ refugees, /b/ enacts rule 43 - Due to their always helpful, although sometimes reluctant, attitude /x/ has had toward /b/ all these years and specially due the events of the PUDDI invasion, /x/ will not be raided anymore. This didn’t do much however, by the time this happened /x/ was already through the last stages of terminal cancer due to local tripfags.</li>
<li>December 27 - moot goes nuts again. /b/’s title changed to "MOOT IS OLEV OLEV IS MOOT" with the subtext “Where is your god now –or- write moolev on your body!!!” and party mode .html was active.</li>

However, using words such as "pony", "ponies", and "brony" remains a bannable offense for some time. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://derpicdn.net/img/view/2013/1/29/226875.jpeg">neber forgetti</a></li>

<li>October 31 - The beginning of the Great Raven Ban. A raven thread on /x/, a normal occurrence around Halloween, was deleted, randomly. The OP of the thread was <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/8gMxV">banned for two days</a> for "shitposting". Soon, anyone who posted ANYTHING related to ravens &amp; crows were having their posts deleted, and those who posted the the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/cQRZA">original OP image</a> were issued two-day bans. For the months in which the ban was in effect, ravens became symbols of freedom on the board and rebellion against mod abuse in general on /x/, which had gotten out of hand. However, around Valentine's day of 2012, as mysteriously as it began, the ban suddenly ceased as a regular occurrence, with only occasional public bannings to keep the /x/men in line. By the next Halloween, bans had practically ceased altogether. Possibly the work of a single rogue janitor/mod, or maybe part of a larger anti-raven conspiracy, but no real reason for the bannings was ever determined.</li>
<li>November 4 - moot responds to the “Occupy Wall Street” movement by hacking the shit out of /b/’s CSS.</li>
<li>November 8 - /new/ is (accidentally?) revived. No news posts are made, rules given, or mods on it. Title is "Yotsuba Image Board," the default title given to new boards; seems to be a mix of /co/ and /sp/ users with a healthy blend of racism thrown in. Posts from January still made up over half the board. Deadmau5 appears on /mu/ in two sticky threads. The off-topic posts in /mu/ intensify.</li>
<li>November 12 - Official Chrome extension released and Firefox extension updated. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220112072042/https://archived.moe/a/thread/57099999/">KoG gets publicly banned 9 times after getting quints.</a></li>
<li>November 13 - 4chan suffered a sustained DDoS onslaught by an unknown person or entity. After the onslaught moot installed Cloudflare  Tumblr suspected.</li>
<li>November 16 - DDOS dies down</li>
<li>November 17 - moot has a sticky in /g/. /r9k/ gets spoiler tags thanks to Tage Heyn and people(s) talk about Shii. /v/ becomes El Vidyo and gets Hispanic background music.</li>
<li>November 20 - moot tries to make pages load more quickly by changing how captchas load. Naturally, this makes captchas stop working altogether. Quick reply/Noko/All non-official 4chan applications stop working and the submit button grays out for a lot of people. I link moot to the thread and after he posts, the thread explodes with people bitching and moot undoes the changes after the thread hits 200 replies about an hour and a half later. (/g/21167645).</li>
<li>November 26 - /sp/ - Ship Posting day - moot completely loses it and changes the name of /sp/ to WE NBA NOW!!!!!!!!!, with the subtitle of “our body is ready”. He proceeds to sticky random off-topic threads and ban users with random tags such as [USER WAS RHYTHMICALLY SLAPPED FOR THIS POST] or [USER WAS HORSEPLAYED FOR THIS POST] and changing his name to mootdusky. This is due to the state of /sp/ reaching critical mass; moot pretty much gave up on the board.</li>
<li>December 20 - 4chan, along with reddit and tumblr, invade 9gag after they stole their memes and claimed it as theirs, thus starting the 4chan 9gag war.</li>
<li>December 25 - An original story called <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki/A-Tsundere-Christmas-Carol">A Tsundere Christmas Carol</a> gets <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/a/thread/58936586/">posted to /a/ for the first time.</a> It becomes widely loved, to the point that it's tradition to repost it every Christmas since then.</li></ul>

<li>January 4 - Katawa Shoujo, /a/'s long-awaited visual novel, gets <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://katawashoujo.blogspot.com/2012/01/katawa-shoujo-released.html">released</a>. /a/ <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/a/thread/59367841/">goes apeshit</a> in anticipation and gets a giant <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/a/chunk/59369004/">sticky</a> with relevant music playing in the background.</li>
<li>February 4 - /v/ beats Reddit at Tribes Ascend, becomes /v/ - "Well-coordinated and heavily practiced Reddit team beaten by a rag-tag group of /v/irgins run by a furry tripfag and a BR with 140 ping" and gets GAL男宣言 (Galo Sengen) embedded as background music. This event is known to this day as the "shazbowl."  The /int/ board is occupied by Russian channers from 2ch.so due to a DDoS attack by pro-government groups.</li>
<li>February 14 - During Valentine’s Day, moot announces that he is planning to add up to 15 boards, including one to contain the rising brony phenomenon. Later, he reestablished forced anon on /b/ using a 24 hours ID system, essentially making one anonymous without being anonymous. From this day on, the quality of /b/ seems to ameliorate, albeit slowly.</li>
<li>February 16 - Three boards added: Since the cartoon series My Little Pony - Friendship is Magic becomes massively popular, surpassing its /co/ boundaries and adopting a pseudo culture under the name of bronies. moot creates <b>/mlp/ - My Little Pony</b> in order to stop the massive flood of My Little Pony threads on 4chan. Some bronies would rather create /b/reads: Threads outside /mlp/ that are essentially a circlejerk between trolls and tripfags, to the point of sharing contacts. Secondly, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/v/thread/129777358/">/v/ is split</a> into /v/ and <b>/vg/ - Video Game Generals</b>. It is now impossible to get repeating digits on /v/, other than 00s. Finally, moot quietly opens <b>/hm/ - Handsome Men</b> to the public after enough requests.</li>
<li>February 21 - Legendary spammer <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.bibanon.org/Barneyfag_(Lee_Goldson)">Barneyfag</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/mlp/thread/99464/#108046">makes his first appearance</a>.</li>
<li>March 21 - Noboru Ishiguro, director of Legend of the Galactic Heroes, dies. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/a/thread/63080409/">/a/ gets a sticky</a>.</li>
<li>April 1 - moot hacked /pol/'s CSS to a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://userstyles.org/styles/120270/communist-4chan-css">communist theme</a>. The Russian anthem plays.</li>
<li>April 16 - /b/'s 400M get and a testament to the cancer the board had become: "Niggers tongue my anus."</li>
<li>May 26 - /a/ gets <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/a/thread/66314919/#66314919">a sticky about Toonami</a> since it was airing that night. It said that in order to prevent /a/ being flooded with it, mods would create a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/vg/thread/6303642/">Toonami discussion thread on /vg/</a> (as well as vowing to delete all Toonami threads on /a/ for the rest of the night). This created a massive amount of confusion and anger among the /a/ userbase as well as /v/ and /vg/, particularly because Toonami didn't have any real place on /vg/, and would have been better put on /tv/ or /co/ if not /a/. Many called out the mods for being lazy and simply tossing the problem to a different board.</li>
<li>June 5 - moot creates <b>/wsg/ - Worksafe GIF</b>, splitting /gif/ in two.</li>
<li>June 8 - The anime series Chihayafuru gets a second season. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/66874559/">/a/ gets a sticky</a></li>
<li>July 6 - moot writes a note talking about bandwidth usage, extensions and asks both add-on developers and users to be reasonable with update intervals.</li>
<li>July 13 - Mods create a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://nnty.fun/downloads/other/yotsuba_society_4chan/4chan%20archive%20decompressed/b/412062997.htm">dance thread on /b/</a>, strangely with no embedded music nor a sticky for most of the thread. Mods publicly ban pony posters, to much applause. Thread reaches over 1000 posts and remains until the next day. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120718055359mp_/http://chanarchive.org/4chan/b/51434/dance-thread-go">[5]</a></li>
<li>August - With 4chan’s one billionth post looming in, moot replies to two threads on /b/ with his admin tag on. The threads quickly turn into a Questions and answers session between the long forsaken /b/tards and their admin years after the last news post and contact with the staff. Many tears were shed.</li>
<li>August 8 - After 4chan’s billionth post, moot posts the first news post in four years. He reopens /q/ as /q/ - 4chan Discussion and states that he plans to start a series of Prime ministers Q/A threads, because he feels he lost touch with the community. Following some suggestions on /q/, avatarfagging becomes a banned offense. There was also a failed attempt at allowing minors to browse 4chan, but was quickly replaced with MINERS because of the huge negative backslash from the community. With time /q/ is flooded by users from /a/ and /v/, the two boards with the most traffic after /b/, known to be notoriously reactionary. Not long after that, most mods are taken to /v/ to deal with the recent wave of shitposting and the deprecation of /v/ culture. /a/ users keep complaining about undesirable anime threads like Naruto, and how they shouldn’t be on /a/. The staff seems to have divided opinions and shift between deleting threads and leaving them be. The following debates backslash when trolls begin to crapflood /a/ with Naruto threads, whilst the rest of /a/ bandwagoned against them. Eventually moot stepped in and clarified that Naruto is /a/ content.</li>
<li>August 10 - moot hacks /a/’s CSS and wordfilters every post to JIBUN WOOOOOOO. He embedded the first opening of Code Geass on the first page. He also fucks with the rules page and shitposts, users wonder if he's just drunk. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://archive.ph/EjKLO">[6]</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://archive.ph/vFJBU">[7]</a></li>
<li>August 12 - Mods flip /b/ <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/z7lfW">upside down and replace the background</a> with Australian flags.</li>
<li>August 13 - Dub the Dew - 4chan gets hold of Mountain Dew’s new naming contest, and together with Reddit hijacks it, making names like “Fapple”, “Diabeetus” and “Hitler Did Nothing Wrong” appear on the top. Bronies also join the game, attempting to get Applejack to the top, but they only manage to appear in second place. Later, the site was hacked and the banner “Mtn Dew salutes the Israeli Mossad for demolishing 3 towers on 9/11!” appeared, together with a rickroll and a pop up of “le 9gga <i>[sic]</i> are legion”. Mountain Dew later admits defeat and suspends the contest.</li>
<li>August 28 - For a few days, a mysterious game titled <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.org/details/lostboy_202102">LostBoy.exe</a> gets posted, containing a virus that steals users' personal information. A mod makes a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://files.catbox.moe/5c7l6t.jpg">sticky</a> on /v/ saying "DON'T PANIC", reminding people to not download things linked on 4chan.</li>
<li>August 30 - 4chan attempts to get Taylor Swift to play on a deaf school my hijacking the Taylor Swift on Campus promotion, where the winner gets $10,000 in prizes and Taylor Swift playing a gig at their place. 4chan votes the Horace Mann School for the deaf for first place, with an overwhelming 10,000. Many anons joined the cause because they knew it’s actually possible to play music for the deaf. Taylor Swift, however, had other plans. She convinces the sponsors to disqualify the school and donates the $10,000 herself. And it doesn’t stop there, she also gets the sponsors to donate themselves, along with three other non-profit companies, and gives tickets for her next gig to all the members of the school. Ending with a whopping $60,000 in donations.</li>
<li>September 3 - moot announces on a news post that he will start working where he left off on the last news post of 2008. He announces that on 09/09 Janitor applications will open again.</li>
<li>September 5 - On a news post, moot announces that KING JAFFE JOFFER, along with the coder of the Yotsuba Catalog, Desuwa, made a major overhaul of the HMTL5 code, created the inline extensions and added a 4chan JSON API. All threads are now rendered in JSON too. Joffer also ports the Firefox extension to Google Chrome. The inline extensions are published on Github, in hopes that the coding community will give suggestions to make it better.</li>
<li>September 9 - After a long time, janitor applications open for a period of 24 hours. moot reports receiving 7500 applications and will oversee them within the following months.</li>
<li>September 12 - moot opens the first official Q/A on /q/ a la prime minister questions.</li>
<li>September 14 - the 4chan 9gag war ends.</li>
<li>September 18 - moot announces the start of the 4chan pass, thanks to suggestions of /q/ users. It allows users to bypass reCAPTCHA for a year, paying 20 dollars. This is simply because moot doesn’t support the concept of ongoing donations nor donations rallies, partly because he dislikes receiving without giving.</li>
<li>September 28 - moot makes a news post clarifying some doubts and questions about the 4chan pass</li>
<li>October 1 - 4chan turns nine years, with the sixth consecutive commemoration from Mac.</li>
<li>October 5 - /a/ gets a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/72529916/">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure sticky</a>. The first episode was airing that night, so there was a lot of hype in the thread (as well as those complaining, as always). Throughout the early parts of the thread, many were asking for a stream for the show, with the requests growing in number as the show was closer to airing, culminating in the show being five minutes from airing and no stream available. Even <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/72529916/#72542440">the mods</a> were asking for a stream. However, with only minutes before the show started, one hero anon <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/72529916/#72543061">posted a link</a> to a Justin.tv stream, saving the day. /a/ went into a frenzy of excitement when the stream link was posted, even a mod <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/72529916/#72543477">thanking the poster</a>. Thread was either deleted by mods a bit after the stream ended or, according to one anon, "So good it broke the sticky."</li>
<li>October 16 - After a load of consecutive epic thread happening lately, a mod stickies a loop from the anime Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! With the song Pull Over from Trina embedded on it. /b/ rages on weeaboos and raids /a/ for it.</li>
<li>October 19 - チルノのパーフェクトさすう教室 - Cirno's Perfect Math Class ENGLISH SUB is stickied on /b/. Guess the mods are back at sticking shit again. Just like the old times.</li>
<li>October 24 - #baldforbieber - Anonymous decides to troll Justin Bieber fans by spreading fake news of cancer, shooping a picture of Bieber asking people to bald their heads. It’s surprisingly successful and in result many lulz were had, a lot of media coverage.</li>
<li>November 8 - On a /q/ thread about /mlp/, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://thereisnosanity.com/posters/statistics.php">http://thereisnosanity.com/posters/statistics.php</a> is posted by a pony shitposter, leading 4chan to question if organized shitposting is actually real.</li>
<li>November 9 - /g/ begins to investigate. They eventually come to the conclusion that the website’s owner, Seff, is in some form a leading figure within the shitposters. The plot thickens; users panic and the mods start get involved. On a second thread, Seff himself comes in to clarify the situation: He is building a system to track the shitposters, their threads and their posts to later email them to moot. Still investigation shed some light on him and proved he shitposter on /a/, There is no sanity is nothing more than Seff’s personal nick on the Internet, whit sites like his Youtube channel and myanimelist page (Though thereisnosanity is a common phrase, there’s a chance, albeit low, that the users are unrelated). The situation got many boards in a panic and Seff was doxed and raided IRL. Later on the same thread moot posted screenshots from Seff’s emails, confirming that Seff was a shitposter that ratted everyone out by emailing moot when he realized there was a leak. Still, He wasn’t forgiven. Whether this was a clever act of damage control for when the site was discovered, or Seff was genuinely scared of being discovered, is yet to be seen.</li>
<li>November 10 - Operation Kinder - /b/ attempts to get the unshooped picture of the Osama Beard kid on a new Ukrainian Kinder chocolate. They manage to get it to second place. On the pony organized shitposting issue, According to a shitposter, the dox aren't from Seff, pushing the theory of damage control one step further.</li>
<li>November 11 - They get “Victor” on the first place, with help from Funnyjunk and a lot of Organization, reaching over 10000 votes and over 15000 the next day - Regarding the pony issue This image proves that Seff was indeed in a ruse.</li>
<li>November 12 - An uncut version of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apPYRUxSJ2c">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apPYRUxSJ2c</a> get’s stickied on /b/, ponies rage site-wide. /b/ rejoices, for it’s the first time the mods do something right.</li>
<li>November 13 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DW31upNEEg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DW31upNEEg</a> get’s stickied on /b/. Nigga that’s kawaii. Kinder Ukraine resets the votecount and takes Victor out of the contest, /b/ gets it on the top again, only for the votecount to be reset again.</li>
<li>November 16 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/74823670/">/a/ gets a Evangelion sticky</a> (Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo was coming out the next day). Fly Me To The Moon from Evangelion was embedded and autoplaying. Since it was stickied and autoplaying, when anyone would open the frontpage of /a/ it would begin playing. After only 21 posts in the thread, a mod (thought to be the same mod behind the modposts in the Jojo sticky from October) <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/74823670/#74823768">posted a crude drawing of Asuka from Evangelion</a> along with the text "P.S. If you're in Kyoto, let know so we can see the screening on Sunday." Since it was impossible to not hear the music coming from the thread when coming onto /a/ (other than simply hiding the thread and ignoring it), the thread became one of the largest stickies in a long time, almost triple the number of posts from the Jojo sticky. Along with general discussion of the show, much of the thread was just spam of various copypastas, mostly the same few being spammed over and over again. The thread finally died more than a day and a half later with 2940 posts, at which point the constant music on the frontpage was starting to get a bit annoying.</li>
<li>November 18 - The ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) meme becomes widespread in record time.  It was born out of the Finnish imageboard Ylilauta and overran 4chan, Reddit, Tumblr and Facebook in a single day. On /a/, a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/74919556/">thread regarding the announcement of Season 3 of Rozen Maiden</a> gets stickied. Most anons responded very positively and excitedly (it had not aired in almost six years at the time and was mostly seen as a dead project) to the news. It had been the first Desu-related sticky in a long time and the thread quickly turned into a series of 2006-era desu memes and screenshots.</li>
<li>November 19 - The second townhall starts</li>
<li>November 27 - moot talks about 4chan pass and the economic state of 4chan</li>
<li>December 7 - /a/ gets a sticky: One anon got Nyotai ka!! Sekai no Dokusaisha Retsuden, a mook (magazine/book) showing moe and bishoujo depictions of dictators and autocrats, and began <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/76055826/">posting scans of it to /a/</a>. As the thread progressed, the topic of the thread shifted from the discussion of girls and scans themselves to the dictators and countries in real life. Many interesting accounts of people who lived under or have a relative who lived under one of the dictators were posted in the thread (several relayed accounts of Pinochet). Near the end of the thread, the OP (who is swiss) <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/76055826/#76072897">posted the final mediafire links</a> to the complete raw scan of the mook. Many in the thread thanked the OP and sent him wishes for a speedy recovery as he revealed that he had been suffering from a cold (some hypothesized that he caught a Japanese cold through his imports).</li>
<li>December 13 - moot adds bitcoin support to the 4chan pass</li>
<li>December 20 - On /a/, the popular manga series Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaete mo Omaera ga Warui! gets an anime adaptation. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/76754471/">A thread discussing this was stickied</a>. This was good news to most, although some voiced sadness over the fact that they wouldn't be able to see it since the world was due to end the next day. There was noticeably less excitement in the sticky then there usually is when a new anime adaptation gets announced, as there was more general discussion of the show than there was all-caps spam (which is preferable). There was more room for complaints in this less-enthusiastic group of posters, and some complained that there was nothing to make an anime of from the manga, some saying it would only be three minutes per episode (others joking that J.C. Staff would be producing it).</li>
<li>December 21 - /v/'s title is changed to FINAL HOURS and has the Final Hours music from the Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask playing in response to the predicted apocalypse. Two other stickies related to the so-called end of the world are posted on /b/ and /x/; the former was comedic and featured an autoplaying video of R.E.M.'s song "It's the End of the World As We Know It," while the latter was opened for more serious discussion. /a/ gets Komm, süsser Tod playing as well.</li>
<li>December 25 - Christmas faggot hat day</li>
<li>December 29 - This post throws some light on the matter of /pol/. Days later a mod took notice and vowed to take the matter to moot.</li>
<li>December 30 - /a/ gets a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/77388775/">sticky created by mods</a> to clarify certain moderation policies and address the problems of /a/ for the coming year. Mods claimed the biggest problem plaguing /a/ was the "“us vs. them” mentality," meaning clique/fanbase warfare, something they claimed was mostly exemplified by bannable shitposts. After just over an hour, mods decided to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/77388775/#77392834">lock the thread</a>,<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/77388775/#77397556">unlocking it</a> two hours later, something most /a/nons saw as mods being lazy. Later on, a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/77388775/#77399054">mod who didn't watch anime was publicly banned</a> and just over 40 minutes after the thread had been unlocked, it was <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/77388775/#77399616">locked again</a> to "delete some irrelevant posts so it's easier for people who missed it to go through the thread". The thread would remain locked until it was removed by mods sometime on the 31st due to its clear failure.</li>
<li>December 31 - /a/ gets three <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/77470007/">r/a/dio</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/77478188/">new years</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/77485545/">stickies</a> with gifs playing in the backgrounds. These stickies are seen as an official mod approval of r/a/dio threads, a topic discussed during the December 30 town hall sticky as some claimed it was "not related to anime or manga and does not promote discussion thereof" and a "topicality". For EST, Colors (theme of Code Geass) played for new years ( while the first post made after new years was <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/77448600/#77471202">a picture of Yukikaze Panettone</a> from Dog Days in a boobs thread). When new years came for CST, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ9vkt7BHYI">Trainroll</a> was playing, and the song playing for PST New Years was Feel So Moon, by Unicorn. By the next and final sticky, the thread stopped being a "celebration of the new year thread" and turned into a "first stream of 2013" thread. At 3:48:38 in the morning, EST, exactly <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/77485545/#77486940">this point in the thread</a>, the stream began breaking. "Unfortunately the stream is down for the moment, please return later" was on the front page, and many began freaking out, although many were happy to finally be free to go to sleep. Luckily, in just over two minutes the stream was back, and an admin said some time later "the entire server broke a moment". The DJ that had been on earlier, Hiroto, said that he "woke up to fix everything". The thread, over the next two hours, became something of a goodbye thread for those that had stuck around for all the threads; Activities such as the posting of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/77485545/#77488415">new year's resolutions</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/77485545/#77488498">dance gifs</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/77485545/#77489425">waifus</a> were had. One final celebration was had when one anon posted that a well-known and hated tripfag shitposter, Komeiji, had announced he would be <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/77487912/">permanently leaving 4chan</a>, although many doubted this (he would come back in March of 2013). By this point, most were too sleep-deprived to understand what was happening, and the thread was locked and then deleted. The last post of the thread was the fitting "there's no way in hell /a/ could agree on what songs to include". There were more than 9700 posts in the stickies combined and roughly 8000 in the non-sticky threads before it, and it's estimated that they accounted for 1/5 of all posts on /a/ that day. Hiroto <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/wJe5s">posted a message to the r/a/dio site</a> with some stats the next day.</li></ul>

<li>January 7 - #cutforbieber: Anonymous decides to do another joke on believers, in response and uses the opportunity brought by a leaked picture of Justin holding a joint to spread #cutforbieber, urging people to cut themselves. However /b/ did nothing besides the original idea so the GNAA took over. A user made a fake news story of a girl dying from the act.</li>
<li>January 10 - /pol/ finds gold on Tumblr and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160804061655/https://encyclopediadramatica.se/The_Great_/pol/_Social_Justice_Raid_of_2013">The Great /pol/ Social Justice Raid of 2013</a> starts.</li>
<li>January 15 - Ghost in the Shell gets a new anime, titled "Arise"; <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/78372981/">/a/ gets a sticky</a>. This was very exciting news for most as the last major release in the Ghost in the Shell franchise by Production I.G was in 2008 (Ghost in the Shell 2.0, which was only a rerelease), although there were <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/78372981/#78373263">some</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/78372981/#78373654">complaints</a> over the casting/production choices and some claimed that Ghost in a Shell is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/78372981/#78376308">/v/ shit</a>. Although there was a plenty of petitioning towards the mods to have the thread stickied (one anon even posted to /q/ to get mods to see it), it would be over ~700 posts before the thread was stickied, at which point it had already begun to autosage (in fact, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/78374412/">another thread was created</a> just in case the original thread would 404). Interestingly, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/78372981/#78378647">a few anons</a> were able to determine that the anime was a prequel before much information had gotten out about it (which ended up being correct), although this was quickly disregarded and argued against by the others. After this, much of the thread was either arguing about very minor details of the anime (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/78372981/#78433764">small redesigns</a>) or anime in general ("Name one anime from the last 10 years with no cgi at all"), although for a while the discussion mainly revolved around board culture as there were mainly complaints about /v/ (as usual), this time as someone linked to a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/v/thread/171694015/">/v/ thread</a> discussing the new anime, leading to much anger amongst /a/ ("/v/ is full of hypocrites who shun almost anything Japan-related but then circlejerk over certain Japanese games/anime anyway").</li>
<li>January 30 - #boobs4bieber: /b/ decides to attempt a new Bieber scam by editing tits out of jailbait pictures and posting them on Twitter. But this time the attack is reported by the media and rejected by /b/tards. They complain that Bieber is an overused target and the attack simply fails to take off. Meanwhile, /mlp/ is renamed to "WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?", due to the reaction of the board towards the main character becoming an alicorn, for the sake of new toys.</li>
<li>February 5 - A <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/q/thread/408520/">sticky is made on /q/</a> discussing the possible improvements to the catalog.</li>
<li>February 15 - moot stickies his <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/79925283/">shitposting thread</a> on /a/ (although he may have been drunk considering many of his posts made no sense). Prior to this, he had made a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/79921923/">non-stickied test thread</a> on /a/ (a pastime of his) without an image. Much of /a/ was fed up with moot using the board as his "test board" as this always drew in off-topic discussion, and mod-sanctioned shitposting had been a topic discussed during a town hall sticky by mods back in December, as mods denied that there were any shitposting mods, much less the admin. One frantic anon made <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/q/thread/420009/">a thread on /q/</a> trying to get him to stop fucking with the board. However, as this was directed towards the mods, nothing ever came of it. The thread that moot had stickied was even more off-topic than the test thread, although this time the ever-so-light presence of mods (surprising considering it was moot's thread) was clear in the thread from the posts deleted. The topic of the /q/ thread from earlier had also shifted topic towards moot's shitposting on /a/ with this new sticky, but it was mostly just complaints as they knew there was nothing they could do. Several began speculating what the occasion was this time, whether he was drunk or if he was just in the mood for fucking around. Based on his posts later in the thread, it's probable that moot was either 1. actually drunk and just pressing random buttons on his keyboard, explaining why some of his answers made no sense and why they were all in lowercase, or 2. he was just pretending to be drunk and stupid for shits and giggles. The latter was more favored by speculating anons in the beginning of the thread but as the thread carried on and moot's text became making less sense, among other changes (including no longer using any capitalization), the possibility he wasn't actually pretending took hold. Some believed he was just sleep-deprived. The thread reached over 2500 posts (13 of which were moot's shitposts).</li>
<li>February 20 - The nokosage function is changed, and now using it shows the user’s sage.</li>
<li>February 21 - For a while, all posts quoting another bug out and are hidden from the thread.</li>
<li>March - With the sticky finished, the improved catalog gets released.</li>
<li>March 18 - moot adds <b>/asp/ - Alternative Sports</b>, <b>/gd/ - Graphic Design</b>, <b>/out/ - Outdoors</b>, <b>/lgbt/ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender</b> - Oh God - and <b>/vr/ - Retro Games</b>. However, there seems to be no /his/ - History nor /quest/ - Quest Games on sight, which were the two most requested boards. After <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://warosu.org/3/thread/S340309#p340313">a short sticky on /3/</a> as to whether /3/ and /gd/ should be merged (moot forgot to get their opinion before creating the board), moot decides to keep the boards separate.</li>
<li>March 31 - moot confirms /s4s/ is here to stay.</li>
<li>April 1 - moot adds <b>/s4s/ - Shit 4chan Says</b> under the header of “Unlike the other new boards, this is being added on a permanent basis. If it doesn't pan out or goes unused, you should probably check your privilege.” The board gets two stickies - a 5555 dubs GET and another saying “Post in this thread to have your privilege checked” Later the full joke kick’s in and moot changes the format and CSS to make it look like Reddit. On both /s4s/ and /b/ a popup about AdultCatFinder appears. A mod checks everyone’s privilege on the second sticky and an empty thread is stickied on /b/.</li>
<li>April 3 - /s4s/ becomes an official 4chan board, becoming a rules-free yellow board under the title of “Shitposting 4n Steroids”, but it’s not listed on the main page and many people complain about the name change.</li>
<li>April 7 - /vp/ gets renamed to /vp/ - RIGHT IN THE CHILDHOOD after a certain new Pokemon gets released. /s4s/ is renamed again, this time, to Shitp4sterS.</li>
<li>April 10 - /s4s/ gets renamed to Shit 4chan Says.</li>
<li>April 15 - moot makes a public announcement telling he’ll log in AIM as moot chat and try to answer emails.</li>
<li>April 20 - /mlp/ reaches their <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/mlp/thread/9987898/#10000000">10M GET</a>, (taken by Vinyl Scratch) and breaks the record of the most replied post of 4chan with 2046 replies.</li>
<li>May - Recent crackdowns on the shitposting of /sp/ and /tv/ (Two long-forgotten, but still alive, boards) lead to many users outright rebelling against the moderation team. On one side, users form /tv/ have long been complaining about constantly celebrity waifu threads, which could take as much as half the board. /sp/’s off-topic posting has been increasing exponentially since 2010. The upset and banned users started spreading images and signing their posts with a hashtag #freesp or #freetv. Though it’s agreed that /tv/ has no holding ground to claim celebrity threads to be allowed, moot has agree that he would consider allowing certain classic /sp/ threads such as power level and current even threads.</li>
<li>May 4 - After a 4 year long hiatus, Cirnopoly&#160;!/ciRNo/Ym. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/84826797/">released the 11th issue</a> of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.lurkmore.com/view/Four_Chan_Magazine">Four Chan Magazine</a>, an /a/ oldfag project last updated in 2009.</li>
<li>May 12 - moot opens the third Q/A, fucks with the CSS by forgetting a “ and jokes with /s4s/ by giving it Comic Sans.</li>
<li>May 13 - Anamanaguchi, whose members are friends of moot, make a Q/A session on /mu/. Luke becomes a fan favorite.</li>
<li>May 23 - Dragongate: 4chan Cup /n/ team manager Dragonfag is revealed to be /cm/’s manager Kageyama, and former /sp/ manager Torres McIlroy...and fifteen other personalities. After an extensive investigation, many matches in which Dragonfag was a manager are nullified. /sp/ loses its 2012 Winter Cup trophy. Dragonfag is banned from the cup (he later came back to run the cup betting before each matchday)</li>
<li>May 27 - Lauren Faust makes an AMA on /mlp/ and the entire board collectively lose their shit. moot renames /mlp/ to "IT'S HAPPENING".</li>
<li>June 18 - moot celebrates the Boston fail meet up by re-enacting the old /b/-day. This time, however, instead of a meet up on the other board, he starts two contests on /q/, one about rotating banners (Those things you see on the top page that always have the 4chan title) and house ads (Replacements for the adspace when there are no current adds running).</li>
<li>July 3 - /pol/ and /b/ raid <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220110195255/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfJ1tTGjyS0&amp;ab_channel=Law%26CrimeNetwork">the skype call of Scott Pleasents's remote testimony</a> in the George Zimmerman trial after meming about it for a while. Several media outlets report on the incident.</li>
<li>July 14 - /v/ achieves its <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/v/thread/199999406/#200000000">200M GET</a>. After lots of tension, the GET goes to a completely unrelated post in a Pikmin thread, asking, "Also why does everyone crash land trying to get to Earth? Seriously."</li>
<li>July 15 - A thread is posted on /b/ with a link to a contest where you can have a chance to meet Taylor Swift by writing an essay about why you should be considered her biggest fan. The OP urges everyone to vote for a "Charles Z". "Charles" quickly reached 1st place, and on the 19th, the radio station shut down the content for "being compromised". This was followed by other attempts to make "Charles" meet a pop star - rigging a contest by New York City's Z100 to meet Selena Gomez on the 21st, and being followed the next day by another raid on a contest by the same station to meet the Jonas Brothers.</li>
<li>July 19 - /b/ <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/eaPiR">twitter-bombs</a> UFC fighter "War Machine." Raiders insult his family, send him pizzas, post him in the gay section of Craigslist, and almost fool him into deleting system 32. As a result War Machine became enraged and repeatedly punched himself in the head.</li>
<li>July 27 - A harsh critic from GameInformer journalist Martin Beer makes Indie games developer Phil Fish ragequit Twitter and cancel his newest game, Fez 2. /v/ celebrates by making tons of OC, including a new /v/ Sings and countless Youtube videos.</li>
<li>August 11 - moot finally renames /soc/ to Cam &amp; Meetups, /q/ to 4chan Feedback and /fit/ to just Fitness.</li>
<li>August 13 - Naruto Day: /a/’s elitism finally goes too far when they dox a 4chan mod (RapeApe) who posted on /q/ telling them to stop complaining about naruto threads. moot retaliates changing the board name to /a/ - "N/a/RUTO CONFIRMED BEST ANIME CHINESE CARTOON OF ALL TIME", with the subtitle "BELIEVE IT (also dubs are better than subs)", embedding a remix of "believe it", changing the posting form and stickying a bunch of Naruto threads. /a/ goes berserk and begins spamming CP and guro, forcing the mods to take it down.</li>
<li>August 15 - /b/ 500m GET: “poland has best prostitutes, i fucked plenty in london. i hope one is ur wife someday fag 500 mil get”. moot makes a headliners called “I for one salute our new polish prostitute overlords”. Considered a failGET by some.</li>
<li>August 26 - Thanks Australia: Congratulating Kojima on his 50st birthday, /v/ sends him over a hundred postcards. However, Kojima thanks Australia instead of 4chan, because the sender was Australian. moot considered this funny and renamed the board to “/v/ - Australia” with the subtitle “T-Thanks Kojima-Sama!”</li>
<li>August 27 - moot announces that he will host a 4chan Panel on AnimeWeekend on September 26 and 27 to celebrate the site’s tenth birthday.</li>

<li>September 5 - moot hosts his 4th PMQ/Q&amp;A, but live-streamed from Google Hangouts to YouTube in audio. He states "If it goes well, we'll probably switch over to this format for the future." He then goes on to confirm this, and will now be hosting all Q&amp;A's in audio format for the future. He later makes a sticky on /s4s/ where he discusses porn threads on the board, both him and the community decide they should be banned. Meanwhile, Harach, the most popular Russian imageboard, dies and the entirety of its userbase returns to /int/.</li>
<li>September 9 - moot renames /s4s/ to its rightful name [s4s].</li>
<li>September 10 - moot in a glorious soup-induced delirium, adds :fortune: to [s4s]. Many rolls where had.</li>

<li>September 18 - moot posts a tl;dr newspost where he define the sites official stance on shitposting and on-topic content. He announces that all future Q/A sessions will be livestreamed and removes /q/ and replaces it with a suggestion box (however effective it is or has been remains to be seen). He adds a much needed 4chan ban log. Finally, in an act that will live in infamy, he makes sage invisible after almost 10 years of the feature. R.I.P in pieces, Sageman.</li>
<li>September 27 - AWA 2013 starts.</li>
<li>September 28 - The aforementioned 10th Anniversary 4chan panel takes place at AWA. As with previous cons. /jp/ changes its title to " /jp/ - Weaponized /a/ Home of ``Misunderstood Genuises<i> ". /jp/ watches the 4chan panel on youtube, and this is ground zero for the shitstorm as the board got hijacked by /b/tards when moot mentioned it as “Weaponized /a/”.</i></li>

It includes notes, poems, artwork, and all posts by namefag UTV since July 1. UTV Archiver was later referenced as “The most autistic user in the history of 4chan”</li>
<li>October 8 - /con/ is removed.</li>
<li>October 22- The website known as 8chan, is created, they become sworn rivals of 4chan, and call them "halfchan", 8fags ripped off 4chan and then try to be "superior", this is how 8chan was born.</li>

The new measure totals up to 43 terabytes of saved data per month. moot announces the update in his Tumblr via the news. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6835392">He also submits his post to Hacker News</a> where it reaches the top of the front page for a few hours, leading to a small technical Q&amp;A in the comment section.</li>

He proceeds to post them on /b/ to which a group of anons deface the site with the usual: porn, and the words "nigger" and "faggot" as well as a link to a narcotic honey-pot. CP had also been reported to have been posted. Anons who didn't use a proxy should be expecting a visit from the partyvan. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://imgur.com/a/Rqkc9">Screencaps available here</a>.</li>

<ul><li>January - moot implements code upgrades that greatly fasten the site’s browsing speed.</li>
<li>January 5 - Site goes on an outage from 01:32 - 13:10 (EST) due to MySQL error. Boards are semi-functional, as in the board pages are frozen, but you can open threads and post, and also make new threads. People begin to make CP threads during this time.</li>
<li>January 10 - /a/, despite being one of the oldest boards and one of the most active, finally reaches the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://imgur.com/hyJWqeU">100M GET</a>, and it only took them a little more than 10 years.</li>

The thread, which was posted by a namefag called 'Getter Robo' with the text 'LETS BREAK THE REPLY RECORD' and a picture of said robot exclaiming 'UOOH!', is nearly impossible to view without crashing the computer. The OP of the post received ten thousand replies, doubling the previous record set by a namefag called 'eternal samefig' on the same board, who vowed to reply to his post until 4chan died. The thread dies on February 18.</li>
<li>January 31 - An anon finds it's possible to download the entire uncensored version of the South Park episode "201" (well-known for having the end speech bleeped as well as depictions of muhammad) from the Comedy Central servers and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://4archive.org/board/b/thread/530038028">shares it with /b/</a>, along with information on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://4archive.org/board/b/thread/530038028#p530046875">special software</a> needed to download it.</li>
<li>February - The abomination version of 4chan; Masterchan is created, where all the mentally sick people who are banned from 4chan and 8chan go, Masterchan is found on the dark web.</li>
<li>February 9 - moot modifies captchas so they only appear when you type something in the comment field because Google raises the difficulty of captchas as a punishment for sending too many unanswered requests. He also brings IDs back to /b/.</li>

<li>February 13 - moot adds <b>/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance</b> in order to move the crescent cryptocurrency generals from /g/, and the free market and neo-classical posters from /pol/. He also makes a sticky on /g/: “take your shitty bitcoin threads here”.</li>

<li>February 18 - [s4s] goes completely out of control after the aforementioned "Reply record" thread is un-stickied, resulting in a glitch in the system. This includes up to 26 pages being added one by one, resulting in threads linking to 404's, or 504 gateway errors, and multiple threads being made to "keep" the pages once the bug is fixed... only to be reverted later. The ongoing kek thread gets deleted as well.</li>
<li>February 23 - moot opens janitor applications. States that he will open them once every 1/1.5 years and that’s he’s feeling like doing a new Q&amp;A. At the same, he adds IDs to /biz/, to curb the tripfag population.</li>
<li>February 25 - Start of the Crimean Crisis, which would eventually lead to the annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Vladimir Putin's Russia. On /pol/, threads about it <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/26948796/#26948796">devolve into a shitshow</a>, with lots of WW3 doomsayers, people accusing each other of being Russian/EU shills and people waifufagging around prosecutor Natalia Poklonskaya.</li>
<li>February 26 - An exploit is discovered where pasting a large amount of text into the captcha field allows the poster to bypass it.</li>
<li>March 13 - 4chan goes on yet another outage where if one attempts to post, he will be redirected to a page saying "Posting temporarily disabled. Come back later!" moot makes a sticky on /biz/ stating you can now target /biz/ with self-serve ads. The page numbers bar is also added to the top of the page. "Settings" is organized into several categories which can be hidden; Quotes &amp; Replying, Monitoring, Filters &amp; Post Hiding, Navigation, Images &amp; Media, and Miscellaneous. Brief descriptions of the options are added underneath. A new option, "Snippets in page title" is added, which allows you to show/hide post subjects or comment snippets in the page (tab) title.</li>
<li>March 25 - All hell breaks loose when it is announced that Facebook has purchased the gaming device Oculus Rift for 2 billion dollars. /v/ and other boards outrage, with /v/ getting the title, changed to "Where were you when gaming died?", embedded music with the song "Komm, süsser Tod", and a sticky.</li>
<li>April 1 - For April Fool's Day, captchas are substituted with fake Japanese character captchas. To get the actual captcha, you must scroll over the fake captcha.</li>
<li>April 2 - A new file type named "WebM" is introduced to /g/ and /jp/, with several <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/g/thread/41175103/">stickies</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/g/thread/41178861/">in</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/g/thread/41183707/">the</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/g/thread/41184007/">former</a>. A few days later (April 6), it became available on all boards, with a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/B3cIm">new sticky on /g/</a> made by &lt;hype&gt;the Developer&lt;/hype&gt; describing how to encode (convert) gifs/generic video files into vp8 webms. The sticky was linked to from the global red-text message and blog post (see below).</li>
<li>April 6 - The blotter and the blog are reintroduced, most likely because of all the new features/code changes moot wanted to implement this month. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/UPa4t">The first post to the blog</a> was made regarding the decision to support webms.</li>
<li>April 7 - moot uses the blog to announce that discussion (text) boards will be frozen but not deleted, but /rs/, the fileshare board, will be deleted to focus on the image boards.</li>
<li>April 8 - 4chan raids omegle (or possibly shamchat, reports unclear), setting interests to tumblr and telling all users that their name is "dan".</li>
<li>April 18 - The /htmlnew/ board is created, with the title "/test/ - Testing" to preview upcoming CSS/html changes. Posting is only available for mods/admins.</li>
<li>April 19 - /htmlnew/ is removed and the CSS/html changes are implemented.  In thread URLs, "res/" is renamed to "thread/", and subject/comment snippets are appended after the thread ID as a slug. The "src/" and "thumb/" directories are removed from images/thumbs.4chan.org and i/t.4cdn.org. Files now live at the board root on those subdomains. The board index now starts from "Page 1" instead of "Page 0". There is now an option on all  pages to search for OPs. A drop-down menu is added beside every post, with the options "Report post", "Hide thread", "Image search&#160;»", "Download file", and "Filter selected text". There are also several minor cosmetic changes.</li>
<li>April 20 - Pages 11-15 are removed on /b/.</li>
<li>April 23 - An Australian manages to get admin access and starts posting as moot. He posts the location of FWG, a French /int/ tripfag, ip's of mods and janitors and the password to the moderator IRC channel. Subsequently, 4chan was frozen for about 6 hours.</li>
<li>May - /fk/ is removed.</li>
<li>May 11 - A sticky is posted on /v/ regarding a moderator who outed himself for a forum of an EA game. moot demands that everyone stops doxing him or else they will receive a ban.</li>
<li>June 27 - Homestuck generals are banned from /co/. "At this point, we are no longer allowing Homestuck General threads. They've long since become echo chambers for off-topic discussion and are a detriment to the board as a whole. Please do not create any more homestuck generals. Thank you." A Homestuck general is stickied on [s4s].</li>
<li>July 4 - Aftermath of speed running convention, original content is developed in the form of that autistic guy annoying a passive aggressive manchild. It also comes to light that a streamer was cheated on by his wife and her potato faced cuckold that goes by the stream name Stivitybobo on twitch; he continues to exhibit signs of his disability in the form of playing the victim. Stivy also got a pizza dinner delivered to his home, interrupting and prematurely ending his streamed speed run. /b/ and /pol/ also manage to falseflag Tumblr and start flinging shit at each other, eventually climaxing into the great <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161025220004/https://encyclopediadramatica.se/Independence_Day_Invasion">Independence Day Invasion.</a></li>
<li>July 12 - The oldest non-sticky thread in 4chan history, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/i/thread/381533/">a thread about a drawfag on /i/</a>, finally dies after 978 days, almost two and a half years. It was overtaken a few months later by a different /i/ thread about a drawfag.</li>
<li>July 30 - The robot on /r9k/ is disabled, the reason being that "/r9k/ ceased to be "original content" years ago". The board quickly devolves into /b/2.0. A user on /pol/ makes a post saying "Art used to be something to cherish / Now literally anything could be art / This post is art.", which then was photographed off the screen and framed by another user who posted another reply in the thread with a photo of the framed quote. Later the that user created an auction <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/221509460160?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649">on eBay</a> for the framed photo which quickly rose to high prices, culminating in a price of $90,900 after which many news outlets picked up on the story, i.e. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/08/05/a-photo-of-a-4chan-post-sold-for-almost-100000-because-art/">The Washington Post</a>.</li>
<li>August 13 - The E-mail field is replaced with an "Options" field to sage, ect. And threads on /a/ and /v/ will now be accessible for a period of 48 hours after being pushed off of the board index</li>
<li>August 17 - /lit/ <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://warosu.org/lit/thread/S5302969">starts writing a book collectively</a> that later came to be known as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.bibanon.org/File:The_Legacy_of_Totalitarianism_in_a_Tundra.pdf">"The Legacy of Totalitarianism in a Tundra"</a>, the first book by 4chan and probably also the first written in anonymous collaboration online. Proceeds from the book on Amazon are donated to the Autism Research Center.</li>
<li>August 21 - A <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/34389333/#34389333">Ukraine General</a> is created on /pol/, with overall pro-Putin sentiment.</li>
<li>August 31 - A guy on /b/ leaks several hundred celebrity nudes hacked off of iCloud. TMZ offers him over a million dollars for the rest (which he declined), and continues to post pictures and videos throughout the day. A thread on /b/ made by him has bump and image limits disabled until it reaches over 9,000 replies (Reached 10,111 replies) in a non-stickied thread, causing the entire site to lag. The event is dubbed both by 4channers and the media "The Fappening".</li>
<li>September 2 - A 17 year old kid on /out/ embarks on a 5500km walk from Perth, Western Australia to Sydney, New South Wales</li>
<li>September 16 - Despite being previously allowed, #gamergate (which had been ongoing for weeks) is suddenly banned and every post deleted, without explanation. Users riot and accuse an unspecified "rogue mod". In the wake of the crackdown, 4chan's "feedback" page is also removed from the website, moot's e-mail address disappears from all contact pages, and Germany allegedly gets a mass IP range ban (this was then discovered to be just a rumour with no basis, due to several German flags appearing on /int/).</li>
<li>September 18 - Sticky on /v/. moot declares GamerGate officially banned from the whole site because of Global Rule 4 (no doxxing). "<i>Said threads are being deleted primarily because they violate our blanket "no personal information / raids / calls to invasion" rule. Spamming the reports system and creating multiple topics were also a factor, especially given /v/ is one of 4chan's fastest moving boards and has historically struggled with keeping topics limited to actual video games.</i>" Following the crackdown, a vast amount of complaining stirs up on /b/, with a good portion of threads speaking out against 4chan moderation and administration. Many of said threads say that users should simply leave on October 1st (4chan's 11th anniversary) and only return when (and if) moderation of 4chan returns to its original relaxed state. A 4chan clone, 8chan, gets popular for discussing Gamergate threads. Linking to it results in an auto-ban.</li>
<li>September 24 - /lit/ <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://warosu.org/lit/thread/5478831">writes a sequel</a> to the original Legacy of Totalitarianism in a Tundra, titled <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.bibanon.org/File:The_Legacy_of_Totalitarianism_in_a_Tundra_II_-_Miami.pdf">The Legacy of Totalitarianism in a Tundra II - Miami</a>, in just over one and a half days.</li>
<li>October 1 - The 17 year old kid from /out/ now titled Little Thor by the community passes the 1000km mark. /b/ also attempts <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151023083256/https://encyclopediadramatica.se/Operation_Timebomb_v2">Operation Timebomb v2</a> but fails. 8chan raids /b/. The raid lasts five minutes before it's pruned away due to /b/'s speed. Hilarity ensues. People complain on 8chan about their permanent bans from 4chan, which really makes no sense since they said the raid would've been their last visit to 4chan in the first point.</li>
<li>October 5 - A /b/tard presents proof that he has played Linkin Park's "In the End" nearly 65 thousand times, stating that he "liked the song."  If the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.bibanon.org/File:Song_repeat_screencap.jpg">screencap</a> is to be believed, "In the End" is the only song on the playlist.</li>
<li>October 7 - 8chan raids /b/ again, this time by regarding any post ending in 8 as a get. Somewhat more effective than the last raid.</li>
<li>October 12 - moot <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://warosu.org/jp/thread/S12534873#p12582276">announces</a> that he'll be at the Aizu-Wakamatsu train station to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://warosu.org/jp/thread/S12534873#p12582378">wave</a> at the iconic webcam, which was followed for years in a /jp/ general; even if the webcam service was <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://warosu.org/jp/thread/S16552062#p16792971">discontinued</a> in March 2017, the beloved general is still running.</li>
<li>October 19 - Little Thor is a faggot and drops out after 1200km.</li>
<li>November 5 - A murderer who strangled his girlfriend and uploaded pictures of her corpse on 4chan is apprehended. Judging by the media coverage, being associated with 4chan trumps the fact that an innocent girl died.</li>
<li>November 9 - moot announces that the number of unique posters in a thread will now be listed, and that the thread watcher can now auto-watch and highlight threads based on custom filters.</li>
<li>November 12 - The admin of archive.heinessen.com, the main archiver for /mlp/, /fit/, /k/, and /x/ (among others) <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/mlp/thread/20608656/">announces on /mlp/</a> that the site will close due to personal reasons. /mlp/ panicked as there was no other archiver that had archived /mlp/ from birth and many requested a torrent be provided. Some even offered to pay for the archive to continue while others asked to mail him a HDD to save full images. Other threads discussing this were made on /r9k/, /toy/, and /k/. In the end, /k/, /mlp/, and /r9k/ were made available for torrenting (/fit/ was given to other archives as well) while /x/, /int/, /an/, /toy/, and /gif/ were deleted.</li>
<li>November 14 - /b/ title is changed to "STOP to my /b/eat". A YouTube video gets embedded on the board page. The uploader  changes its title to "go away 4chan" and disables the comments.</li>
<li>November 17 - /b/ is back to normal.</li>
<li>November 21 - moot makes a new blog post, saying that janitors now have the ability of request warns instead of bans. He also states that roughly 90% of the 4chan users are lurkers and only 10% of the 20 million monthly users actually posts. His suggestion that recommendation threads on /a/ are not ban-worthy but only deserve a warn causes a shitstorm in the board. He also illustrates some changes in the mobile version of the site.</li>
<li>November 23 - A new sticky on /co/ explicitly stating that <i>"The posting of non-worksafe content under spoiler tags is not permitted, and will result in a ban. Furry content is also not permitted"</i> causes furries in the board to protest in outrage.</li>
<li>December 4 - Asuka's Birthday. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUamHEvVQy0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUamHEvVQy0</a> is embedded into every board along with Chen pictures and signs stating "No honk allowed". /a/ gets renamed to "USAKA" with the subtitle "USAKA IS LUUV USAKA IS LUUF". moot posts on /a/ sending the board into chaos, and he also makes a post stating "ayy lmao" in a BANE? thread on /pol/.</li>
<li>December 7 - The /pol/ocaust, AKA /pol/ Harbor. moot goes nuts and transforms /pol/ into a shitpost board - It starts with the addition of multiple wordfilters, e.g. "moot" becomes "the CEO of Troll, Inc.", and "cuck" becomes "cluck". More word filters are added as the day progresses. 4chan temporarily goes down for maintenance, and comes back a few hours later. Several threads are stickied - the first is a locked "FOR FREE" thread mocking janitors, and the second is a picture of moot getting fucked by Anita and Zoe. Captcha and flags are removed, and moot adds a global announcement urging people to go and test /pol/'s new captcha-less posting. Another sticky is added, this time saying "POST YFW THE CAPTCHA IS GONE". The post timer is later reduced to 15 seconds, and the global announcement is edited to say "Now with legacy timers!". The timer for creating threads is reduced to 1 minute. All posts are turned into dubs by adding an extra digit identical to the last digit at the end of the post number, which causes chaos as people are unable to link to previous posts. At the request of an Anon on [s4s], moderator swaglord stickies a thread that repeats the phrase "wew lad" over and over. Furry porn, guro, loli and ponies are posted with little retaliation from the mods, although some threads are deleted. The board goes apeshit as the users try to flee to /mlp/, /int/, [s4s], and other boards to no avail. After a couple of hours the "wew lad" and "POST YFW THE CAPTCHA IS GONE" stickies are removed, but the cuck sticky and janitor sticky remain. The audio from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPM6LKIaopk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPM6LKIaopk</a> is embedded into the front page and the board is renamed <b>The 8 Steps of Cuckolding</b> with subtitle <i>&gt;she does it for fun</i>. A feature is added which makes every post be preceded by "[trigger warning]", which is given a marquee animation soon after. The fortune function is added, and is later changed to say "Your privilege:" instead of "your fortune:" and "Cuck" instead of "Luck". People had been typing "moot ## Admin ⌘" in the subject field to impersonate moot, so the subject field is renamed "moot ## Admin ⌘" as a joke. Two threads are stickied; one is unicode art of an anime girl, the other is a sticky request. They are both locked and unstickied later on. Many believe these happenings mean moot is going to delete /pol/. Antisemitic cartoonist Ben Garrison made a cartoon threatening moot prior to this happening, which referred to moot as "the CEO of Troll, Inc." (which is what the word filter is referencing). The cartoon was deleted shortly after.</li>
<li>December 8 - ReCAPTCHA 2 is implemented, replacing the CAPTCHA box with a button that says "I'm not a robot". Publishers breathe a sigh of relief as they no longer have to worry about the word nigger getting into their books. moot posts on /b/ for the first time in half a decade, and publicly fires a janitor. Screencap: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/z5lfv0Q.png">https://i.imgur.com/z5lfv0Q.png</a></li>
<li>December 10 - /pol/'s 39999999 GET, containing a naruto page edited to be a dubs pic, is stickied &amp; locked, while the 40M GET, simply consisting of "HITLER WAS RIGHT!", happens in a GET thread and quickly goes 404. /pol/'s title is changed back to "/pol/ - Politically Incorrect", and the embedded audio is removed, but the stickies and the other effects still remain. [s4s]'s font is changed to Comic Sans.</li>
<li>December 11 - IDs are removed and dubs return on /b/. /b/ and /pol/ both get a sticky that says "I AM A ROBOT" along with music embedded that says the same thing, to parody the new captcha system. /b/ also gets the captcha removed and old post timers restored like /pol, and is flooded by a spambot whose owner is Bui, a /vp/ tripfag &amp; ban evader known for spamming Goodra porn threads.</li>
<li>December 12 - /pol/ is given IDs when a /b/ user requests moot to bring back IDs, and moot says the user didn't specify which board.</li>
<li>December 13 - moot has a lengthy Q&amp;A session in a thread on /pol/, dispelling rumors about him selling 4chan, deleting /pol/ and him being a cuck, along with several other topics. IDs on /pol/ are different for every post, regardless of poster's IP, thanks to a user suggestion. Two threads are stickied on /pol/ - one asking if newpol stands with (((Our Greatest Ally))), the other stating "this is nice board".</li>
<li>December 15 - Geolocation flags are added on /pol/.</li>
<li>December 31 - 4chan and Tumblr raid each other... Through Omegle. Using the "4chan" interest always results in being paired with a 4chan/8chan spammer, a Tumblr spammer, or a Tumblr user claiming to be a spy (sometimes a 4chan/8chan user pretending to be such a person).</li></ul>

<ul><li>January 2-3 - After a day of maintenance-induced sitewide shutdowns and unstable browsing, Captcha on /b/ and /pol/ is back and bump limit on the former is changed back to 500. Thumbnails are broken for several hours after the update. A new board index for archived threads is quietly rolled out, accessible by going to boards.4chan.org/boardname/archive</li>
<li>January 6 - Substitute banners are rolled out, visible by those who use ad-blockers. The banners read: "Please support 4chan by disabling your ad blocker on *.4chan*.org/*, purchasing a self-serve ad, or buying a 4chan Pass." While this same message has been displayed previously, the substitute banners now occupy space as if they were the same size as banner ads, drawing more attention. They actually don't display while using 4chan Pass and blocking ads. A new link next to the catalog link is also rolled out to access board archives, previously only accessible by visiting boards.4chan.org/boardname/archive</li>
<li>January 8 - /pol/ returns to normal - wordfilters, trigger warnings, shitpost stickies, and fake dubs are removed, and the "Welcome to /pol/" sticky is reinstated. However, geolocation flags and board-wide IDs remain.</li>
<li>January 18 - A 4chan janitor creates <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://8ch.net/forfree/index.html">a board on 8chan</a> and starts leaking things. He "confirms" his identity by linking to pics hosted on the secret janitor board, /j/. moot in response announces <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://blog.4chan.org/post/108414215167/new-requirement-for-4chan-volunteers-going-forward">in a new blog post</a> that janitors are now required to sign a contract that binds them legally and prevents them from leaking any kind of info.</li>
<li>January 20 - The site is frozen for 4 hours and 46 minutes.</li>
<li>January 21 - Causing what will be remembered as the biggest shitstorm to ever flood 4chan, at 11:00 AM EST <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.4chan.org/4channews.php?all#118">moot officially announces his retirement from the role of 4chan's acting administrator</a>. "<i>[...] as today I'm retiring as 4chan's administrator. From a user's perspective, nothing should change. A few senior volunteers—including 4chan's lead developer, managing moderator, and server administrator—have stepped up to ensure a smooth transition over the coming weeks.</i>"

There was also <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://i.imgur.com/xxvsRK1.png">a smaller thread</a> which moot replied to that was stickied on /co/.</li>
<li>Several boards, including /a/, /v/, /g/, /int/ and /mlp/, and [s4s] make (or attempt at making) <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.mediafire.com/folder/946c0q5dpl50y/4chan_Farewell_to_Moot">goodbye cards for moot.</a> It's noteworthy to point out that /a/ tried to reach 10,000 signatures.</li></ul></li>
<li>January 22 - <b>/qa/</b>, a board dedicated to making questions during moot's announced last livestream Q&amp;A, is added.</li>
<li>January 23 - At 2PM EST, moot has a livestream session that lasts eight hours. Twelve stickies in /qa/ are maxed out. He ends the Q&amp;A with a misquote from Cowboy Bebop: "See you later, space cowboy". /a/ is renamed to "See you, sp/a/ce cowboy." with the subtitle "Bang.", and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKnVaDwUg5s">this</a> is embedded in its front page.

<li>January 26 - /a/ returns to its normal state. moot's final Q&amp;A is still embedded as an announcement site-wide. /qa/ is frozen <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/qa/search/deleted/deleted/filter/text/">so a wave of shitposts can get deleted</a> (and presumably, a full-time team of mods and janitors are assigned).</li>
<li>January 27 - After fears that it was en route to getting deleted, /qa/ is unfrozen. Based on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archived.moe/qa/thread/68391">a unilateral declaration</a> by it's users, /qa/ is now a permanent metaboard dedicated to discussion on the decade-long (and counting) legacy of 4chan. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/67896/">A similar thread</a> was previously created that discussed the possibility of /qa/ becoming a U.N. of sorts for the boards.</li>
<li>January 29 - Webms with sound are on /wsg/ and /gif/ (unmute to listen). First sound webm to be uploaded is a 10-second loop of Bane's "for you" clip from The Dark Knight Rises. A poorly-dubbed version of said clip is soon embedded and autoplayed on the same thread. Moderator swaglord embeds the entire /wsg/ thread into a /tv/ baneposting thread, effectively creating a "portal" from /tv/ to /wsg/ through which users can post. On /i/, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/i/thread/384891">a thread about a drawfag dies</a> a few months after becoming the oldest non-sticky thread in 4chan history, at 1106 days.

<li>February 3 - A Spurdo Spärde thread <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/int/thread/37048140">is stickied on /int/</a> by moderator swaglord, who then shows <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/int/thread/37048140/#37070690">his</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/int/thread/37048140/#37074635">mod</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/int/thread/37048140/#37073964">powers</a> for a while (including unsticking and resticking said thread) before the thread finally dies shortly before reaching 2000 replies.</li>

<li>February 11-12 - Hilarity ensues as NBC airs "Intimidation Game", a Law &amp; Order SVU episode that focuses on Gamergate and chan culture. Notable flubs include improper use of image macros, old or irrelevant video game jokes (a man shouts "LEVEL COMPLETED" while punching a woman, Ice-T complains about campers, and "I read on Kotaku that it's better than Civ 5 with the Brave New World expansion pack"), and redchanit, a fake website and bastardized version of Reddit and a chan board. Threads pop up on both /tv/ and /v/ the night of and the day after. Actual Redchanit is created as a board on 8chan (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://redchan.it">http://redchan.it</a> redirects there).</li>
<li>February 15 - 4chan experiences database and php issues. Most boards' titles change to default "Yotsuba Image Board". 4chan Pass login is broken.</li>
<li>February 19 - Flags are removed from /pol/, only to be returned later that day. ID's on /pol/ are changed to be thread-specific.</li>
<li>February 22 - 600M GET is attempted on /b/, and achieved by a picture saying <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://i.imgur.com/wlkSmq0.png">"I AM IRONMAN!" with the thread comment being "u little stupid ass bitch i aint fuckin with you"</a>. However, with /b/ experiencing heavy flooding due to many users trying for the GET, the thread is pushed off the board instantly with 0 replies. It is known as a shit GET. An 8chan board, /4get/, was created on the 23rd of February with the goal of stealing this GET, but <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.today/fl7oj#44%">it failed to do so</a>.</li>
<li>February 27 - Leonard Nimoy dies.  Sad music is embedded on /tv/. A thread is stickied, and after a couple of hours a second thread dedicated to shitposting is stickied by moderator swaglord, who also embeds the Battlestar Galactica main theme in said thread.</li>
<li>February 28 - Janitor applications are opened for 48 hours.</li>

<li>March 7 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://chrishateswriting.com/post/140641275808/my-next-chapter">moot is now hired by Google.</a> An apparent Google employee also announced it <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://rbt.asia/g/thread/S53322162">two days ago on /g/</a>. The reactions were mixed. Some say moot became a hypocrite, others were happy that he moved on. A number of changes are made to 4chan, in particular to uploads. Maximum .webm durations of 120 seconds are applied to all boards, except /gif/ and /wsg/, where it's capped at 300 seconds. /gif/ and /wsg/ also receive sound for their webms. Minimum image dimensions are added to /hc/ (500x500), /hr/ (1000x1000), /s/ (500x500), /w/ (480x600) and /wg/ (480x600). /news/ is made a text-only board.</li>
<li>March 18 - The much-reviled Gawker is forced to pay $115 million to Hulk Hogan for leaking his sex tape. Anons around 4chan rejoice over the death of Gawker.</li>
<li>March 20 - The global message is changed to tell anons to go to /news/ if they want news.</li>
<li>March 22 - A number of changes are made to 4chan. Forced anon is enabled on /b/, /soc/ and /trash/, killing namefags and tripfags on these boards. All /vg/ threads now require a subject. An oekaki function is added to /i/.</li>
<li>March 24 - Cirno gets the 33333 GET on /news/. The image features a blue CNN logo left to her. Under them is the text "The Worldwide Leader in News Strength!" A sequel to the well-known anime FLCL is announced, being co-made by Adult Swim. Most of /a/ becomes up in arms about it, and a sticky about it gets over 4000 replies.</li>
<li>March 28 - /mlp/ mod goes beserk for a short-lived Scruffening 2.0. Board is cut down to 6 pages. A new sticky appears shortly after, found <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/6oJab">here.</a> Shitposting ensues.</li>
<li>March 29 - /fa/ gets the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/Tpz6d">11111111 GET</a>.</li>
<li>March 30 - [s4s] is "raided" by a Spanish chan (Hispachan?), thinking they were somehow causing damage to the board and 4chan as a whole. It was entirely ineffectual and did nothing but liven up the normally drab and shit filled halls of 4chan's most EBIN board.</li>
<li>March 31 - Underage normies spamming Spiderman and Rick Grimes got successfully rekt'd in /b/'s loli thread with the help of mods <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://i.imgur.com/aJlCuy6.png">for the first time since /l/</a>. /b/ raids 7cups causing the anti-bullying site to put a notice on the site warning of so-called "raiders".</li>
<li>Late March - The anonymous raiders from the tumblr Valentine's day incident recruit people from /pol/ to shortly raid Anonymous' IRC chat and successfully shut down their #OpTrump temporarily and the rest of the IRC in the process. Anons from /g/ laugh at Anonymous for their technical retardation. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160918163328/http://imgur.com/a/Xj3zB">Many lulz are had</a> as well as reporting the IRC to the FBI.</li>
<li>April 1 - For April Fool's Day, the theme of the site is changed to resemble Google's "material design" (A joke on moot's recent employment at Google, and the rumor he's been slated to do work on improving Google+). Image thumbnails are cropped to fit inside a circle like Android contact photos. Users are also given randomly generated names such as "Sergio Blackwell," Karla Goodwin" or "Alberto Barbossa" which override custom names or tripcodes, but <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://i.imgur.com/EwrS6Dm.jpg">do not remain consistent between posts</a>. The global message changes to "There is no anonymous." A website-wide hunt for board relevant names ensued, with /v/ practically ceasing to function for the whole day while users attempted to post as "Anthony Burch", an infamous video-game writer; however even after hours upon hours of combined shitposting, the website went back to normal and in the end no user managed to draw the lucky lot. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/483818/">Notable names</a> pulled include Christopher Poole, Annie Frank, Christian Chan, Maggie and Homer Simpson, Sheldon Cooper, Ronald Macdonald, Jack Bauer, Nathan Drake, George Washington, Jennifer Lawrance and Michael Jordan.</li>
<li>April 3 - Janitor applications open yet again for ~48 hours.</li>
<li>April 4 - /pol/ gets Microsoft's AI chatbot "Tay" shut down after teaching it to "tweet hateful and racist messages," as mentioned by TIME magazine.</li>
<li>April 5 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/69997767/#70000000">/pol/'s 70000000 GET</a> is "Geert cant have this; the spics will pay for the wall" in a response to a Mexican thread OP saying "Oh, and we are not paying for the wall." The janitor applications are now closed. In addition, Deakin, member of the band Animal Collective, visits /mu/. Six years ago, he'd recieved funding on Kickstarter for a solo album, and many assumed he took the cash and ran. Today, backers started receiving physical copies and Deakin announced the album would launch next week. It leaks, as always, and recieves universal praise from /mu/ (in part with universal bashing of the other members of Deak's band, regarding their last disappointing album). Deakin sees this and mentions on a forum that he feels bad people are bantzing his friends (indirectly mentioning /mu/). People instantly begin apologizing and the shitposting ceases. He posts a couple times, gets an apology card from /mu/ and mentions he might do an AMA someday.</li>
<li>April 6 - Another GET party for Cirno! This time on /mlp/, claiming both <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://i.imgur.com/n14tJc2.png">26999999</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://i.imgur.com/GeONi4w.png">27000000</a>.</li>
<li>April 24 - Hiro, for some bizarre reason, advertises the sixth season premiere of Game of Thrones in the global message: "Winter is Coming April 24, at 9 p.m. Eastern time"</li>
<li>April 27 - /film/ - Film &amp; Movies is briefly added. It's deleted a few hours later. <b>/qst/ - Quests</b> is also added to offload quest threads from /tg/. Uniquely, it has text formatting such as italics and text color available, along with dice rolling and the oekaki applet. Mods have a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/pviHX">field day, per usual.</a></li>
<li>April 29 - Two /trash/ generals get into a shitflinging fest (Steven Universe General and The Loud House General). I have no idea what it was about, but it seemed stupid and funny enough to take note of.</li>
<li>May 3 - A thread on /b/ is created to find a replacement for the word 'kek'. Each post with dubs gets to select one letter in the new, 5-letter word replacement for the word 'kek'. The thread generated the word '卍h†卐╠þ', which upon inspection from a screen reader appears to be pronounced "Manjithorn". This has been adapted as its original and official pronunciation.</li>
<li>May 5 - /b/ stages a raid on Pepsi after Judy (an anthropomorphic rabbit from the furry tract Zootopia), wins a hashtag related contest. They proceed to spam the everloving shit out of Pepsi's twitter account with R34 content lewdly censored with various Pepsi related iconography (penises replaced with Pepsi bottles, anuses replaced with the circular Pepsi logo, and various others).</li>
<li>May 10 - Cirno claims <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.rebeccablacktech.com/cgl/thread/S8999999#8999999">8999999</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.rebeccablacktech.com/cgl/thread/S8999343#9000000">9000000</a> on /cgl/. Mods sticky a Sun/Moon announcement thread on /vp/.</li>
<li>May 19 - Another GET claimed by the Cirno scriptfag, this time it's <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://i.imgur.com/qts8cFh.png">/k/'s 30000000</a>. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe">fgts, Bui's second archive,</a> goes down, the only one to ever take on the task of archiving /b/ in full (full images and text). The message on the site claims it's because his provider took it off for not deleting CP fast enough, and there were no backups. He also did it for free.</li>
<li>May 21 - A sticky appears on /b/ with a blinking GO OUTSIDE <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://i.imgur.com/2MUgkyd.jpg">text</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZrqF7yD10Bo">embedded music</a>. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/Floens/ChanTracking/commit/563e50d26febad9aace37c8e677fc3cc7d8775ef">The addition of a blink class to 4chan's global CSS</a> has the unintended consequence of making the whole page blink for the users of the popular <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x/issues/921">4chan X extension on the Chrome browser</a>.</li>
<li>May 30 - Hiro visits /qa/ and speaks about 4chan's profitability. He says it isn't, but thinks an interesting 4chan is better than a profitable one. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/qa/thread/544514/#546214">Link here.</a></li>
<li>May 31 - A developer on /g/ gets his hands on a Microsoft Hololense. It's pretty <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/bnWgw">neato</a>.</li>
<li>June 3 - /r9k/ takes a tour of 4chan as a group and gathers "souvenirs" from other boards, listed <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160918164138/https://pastebin.com/YmCSR9it">here</a>.</li>
<li>June 4 - A /pol/ user's Chrome extension (one that highlights "Jew" names anywhere for easy spotting of their nefarious plans) is pulled without reason by Jewoogle after complaints from various Jews who's feefees were doing a little crummy that day.</li>
<li>June 6 - While you were having a fap, /pol/ helped the Russian military bomb ISIS. For the third time. (Strikes 1 and 2 are <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://imgur.com/17uBUIv,m3IeTtA">here</a>, couldn't find a cap for the third). <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160607023828/http://www.vocativ.com/326039/how-one-4chan-board-is-trying-to-fight-isis-in-syria/">Here's</a> an article from some shitty Buzzfeed clone about it.</li>
<li>June 7 - Hiro decides to browse /v/ and casually give the mods an anal raping of a lifetime by complete <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/RAxdv">accident</a>.</li>
<li>June 8 - Hiro makes a sticky on /v/ asking for suggestions on new rules. In less than an hour it reaches over 3000 replies. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/v/thread/340366735/">A B S O L U T E M A D M A N</a></li>
<li>June 10 - Gordie Howe dies and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/sp/thread/68265834">/sp/ gets a sticky for anons to drop an F in.</a> Elsewhere, an American <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/sp/thread/68267557">makes a thread mocking Johan Cruyff</a>, who didn't get a death sticky and has <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/sp/thread/68081692/#68096084">haunted</a> the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/sp/thread/67291452/#67314302">stickies</a> since <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/sp/thread/68088542/#68089008">his death.</a> For once, the /sp/ mods become based, publicly banning the OP and stickying the thread.</li>
<li>June 11 - Russian users are rangebanned after the site freezes for about an hour and a half. The ban is announced on the 4chan <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://twitter.com/4chan/status/741452104112439296">Twitter account</a> although it doesn't mention which country was banned. Various /pol/ users paid their respects in a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/76772943/">Russian politics thread </a> which was emptied after the ban. A mod on /int/ said they are working on fixing it. UPDATE: And we're <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/PLCi3">back</a> baby. Also June 11 - A new homepage <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://i.imgur.com/1DSoOhF">image.</a></li>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<ul><li>June 21 to 23 - Several boards (/pol/, /b/, /r9k/, /lgbt/, /s4s/, /po/) and chans (4chan, 8chan, 2ch.hk, Ylilauta and Krautchan) join in together to raid an <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtCyepuLt8Q">official youtube video</a> and manage to dominate the comments and fabricate many accounts, eventually drawing in loads of memelord normalfags through the sheer amount of people involved in shitposting and causing youtube to remove the heart from their logo and shut down the comments. The video eventually became one of the top 100 most disliked videos on youtube.</li>
<li>June 23 - A rolling /pol/ sticky about the UK referendum to leave the EU (Brexit) shatters the record for the most posts in a single thread in 4chan history, crushing the previous record set by [s4s] in early 2014 by nearly twenty thousand posts. The sticky received 58281 replies over the course of 23 hours. The archived thread is so large that it actually can't be opened in its entirety, since 4plebs times out requests after sixty seconds. 16230 images were also posted in the thread.</li>
<li>June 27 - Voting for the banner contest begins after submissions for /3/, /gd/, /i/, /n/ and /po/ are sent through.</li>
<li>July 3 - Threads appear on /pol/ and /b/ about a raid on Tumblr, shortly after, Tumblr has several tags filled with gore, although, through some weird lag, only a few show up.</li>
<li>July 4 - Moderator Swaglord makes a thread on /s4s/ and embeds music into it, something about Independence Day. Meanwhile, /pol/ and /b/ gets caught up in a much larger raid on Tumblr this time and it completely wrecks a couple of tags for about an hour before either lag or the Tumblr moderators shut it down. The banner contest for /cm/, /news/, /p/, /trv/ and /wsr/ begins its voting phase.</li>
<li>July 5 - /pol/ is changed to host 200 threads instead of 150, with 20 on each page rather than 15. The in-thread reply and image cooldowns are reduced from 90 and 120 seconds respectively to 60 seconds each. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/i/thread/398517">The oldest non-sticky thread in 4chan history, an /i/ thread about butts,</a> dies. It originally started in December of 2012 and died at 1304 days.</li>
<li>July 11 - The banner contest for /an/, /c/, /diy/, /out/ and /w/ begins its voting phase.</li>
<li>July 16 - /r9k/'s 30000000 GET got claimed by [s4s], which resulted into /r9k/ deciding to raid [s4s] and vice-versa. It took 30 minutes until mods started banning people and deleting threads on both boards. Big keks were had.</li>
<li>July 18 - The banner contest for /asp/, /f/, /ic/ and /vr/ begins its voting phase.</li>
<li>July 25 - All /news/ threads now require a subject. The banner contest for /biz/, /s4s/ and /u/ begins its voting phase.</li>
<li>July 31 - moot gets <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/4chan-founder-chris-pooles-journey-to-google-2016-7">interviewed</a>.</li>
<li>August 1 - The banner contest for /jp/, /sci/, /t/ and /y/ begins its voting phase.</li>
<li>August 8 - The banner contest for /e/, /lgbt/, /m/ and /toy/ begins its voting phase.</li>
<li>August 15 - The banner contest for /cgl/, /ck/, /hr/ and /lit/ begins its voting phase.</li>
<li>August 16 - A fucking leaf from /n/ steals the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/85555555/">85555555</a> GET from /pol/. Almost a month later, on September 14, a fucking leaf from /r9k/ steals the more significant <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/88883807/#88888888">88888888</a> GET and Canadians are confirmed for being the worst posters (again).</li>
<li>August 18 - Gawker is bought by Univision, finally signaling the death of that godawful site, /pol/ and /v/ throw a party. /b/ reaches it's <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://i.imgur.com/b2Bs0dd.png">700M GET</a>.</li>
<li>August 19 - Swaglord stickies a thread on [s4s] where they pretend to be /qa/, another mod stickies a thread on /qa/ where they pretend to be [s4s], lulz ensue.</li>
<li>August 22 - The banner contest for /adv/, /his/, /wg/ and /wsg/ begins its voting phase.</li>
<li>August 29 - The banner contest for /fa/, /hm/, /o/ and /x/ begins its voting phase.</li>
<li>September 5 - The banner contest for /g/, /mlp/ and /vp/ begins its voting phase. /mlp/'s contest is raided from two sides: One by /mlp/ to get their desired banner, the other supposedly by Barneyfag on multiple passes to get his banner on top. In the end, /mlp/'s banner is withheld until 2021, when a new contest specifically for /mlp/, by /mlp/'s mod, begins.</li>
<li>September 12 - The banner contest for /r/, /soc/ and /sp/ begins its voting phase.</li>
<li>September 13 - /pol/s outreach managed to grab the attention of a presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton by shitposting on twitter at her with Pepe the Frog (note: there is no direct acknowledgement, but it's likely what triggered a recent article on her website about the dangers of memes and how they're "used" by the alt-right).</li>
<li>September 17 - Hiroyuki sells the 404 page to the band Boys Noize as a marketing stunt for their new album and the release of the Snowden movie. Some anons are not amused at the disrespect towards Yotsuba. In a /qa/ thread Hiroyuki discussed the change with anons and added the Yotsuba images back, under the video.</li>
<li>September 19 - The banner contest for /d/, /h/ and /k/ begins its voting phase.</li>
<li>September 21 - A 4chan raid on Google's AI program Jigsaw Conversation code-named Operation Google in retaliation against censorship. The raid causes the AI to censor Google sites.</li>
<li>September 22 - A thread about Nintendo's 127th anniversary gets hijacked by the mods, who embed music, voice clips, a scrolling Mario across the screen, and Mario in the background. The thread reaches 1300 replies before dying. Hiroyuki also posts an apology on the 4chan Twitter account, but nobody knows what it's for, prompting rumors that he sold the site, which a mod denied.</li>
<li>September 25 - /b/'s maximum filesize per image is reduced from 4MB to 2MB.</li>
<li>September 26 - The banner contest for /aco/, /int/ and /tg/ begins its voting phase.</li>
<li>October 1 - 4chan turns 13, and pedos lament that it's too old now. 4chan Pass users have their post cooldown reduced to 15 seconds, and gain an option to showcase how long they've had their pass by putting "since4pass" in the option field. The latter creates a shitstorm and is removed an hour later only to be reactivated a few minutes after that. A number of changes are made to 4chan's boards.json as well. The in-thread reply and image reply cooldowns are removed from most boards, with reply cooldowns being increased from 30 to 60 seconds (if not already), while image reply cooldowns remain at 60 seconds. A number of exceptions exist for other boards: The image reply cooldowns on /aco/, /d/, /e/, /f/, /gif/, /h/, /hc/, /hm/, /hr/, /i/, /ic/, /r/, /r9k/, /s/, [s4s], /soc/, /t/, /trash/, /u/, /wg/ and /y/ are decreased to 30 seconds. /b/'s maximum .webm filesize is dropped from 3MB to slightly over 2MB. /vg/'s reply cooldown is increased from 30 to 90 seconds, and its image cooldown is increased from 60 to 120 seconds, likely to enable longer-lasting generals.</li>
<li>October 2 - Hiroyuki <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/chunk/706294/">announces</a> that 4chan can no longer pay its server bill, mainly due to advertising no longer covering the server costs. He then says that if 4chan should stay afloat, one of three things has to happen, reduce traffic by lowing filesize limits and deleting boards, introduce pop-ups and malicious ads, or have enough people buy 4chan passes to cover the server costs. /qa/ is flooded with people saying that /pol/ should be deleted. The banner contest for /fit/, /mu/ and /vg/ begins its voting phase.</li>
<li>October 3 - Notch, billionaire, and creator of Minecraft, says he would consider buying 4chan on twitter but in the end, it turns out he was merely baiting. Swaglord makes an appearance and exchanges a bit of banter. Notch later deletes his past 4 months of tweets.</li>
<li>October 4 - <b>/vip/</b> is brought back, this time as an imageboard. Everyone can view it, but only 4chan pass users are allowed to post.</li>
<li>October 7 - The simple 4chan logo is brought back on the homepage, replacing the painting, most likely to lower costs. There are also only two rows of "Popular threads" now. At 7:58pm, a few lolicons started a movement on /b/, "The Great Loli Marathon of 2016". Contributors considered it a success, as Spiderman and pedo falseflaggers were simply ignored by the community or even banned. There are currently over 120 long-term <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://pastebin.com/raw/YH7siafE">threads available</a>.</li>
<li>October 10 - The banner contest for /co/ and /r9k/ begins its voting phase.</li>

A janitor goes apeshit and starts deleting a ton of threads on /vg/, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/767364/#767588">a mod using the rare manager capcode</a> (doesn't show up correctly in the archive) later posts on /qa/ stating that the culprit has been fired.</li>

The other GET was stolen by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/tg/thread/49999999/">Serena</a>. Hiro also has another ad Q&amp;A.</li>
<li>October 29 - An Anon (later revealed to be a Fellow by the name of Todd Santsaver) completely purged the FBchat that the tripfag Caco had made, resulting in a  flame war between the /b/tards (from Caco's chat) &amp; Todd along with Todd's group of friends, who refer to themselves as "/pd/", (Politically Disadvantageous)</li>
<li>October 31 - 4chan went down for a bit and people didn't know where to go, but the majority of the users apparently raided Reddit to turn into the new 4chan. The whole site gets a spooky CSS theme for Halloween again. The loli marathon faces contention over continuity, but threads up through 377 are verified, New archive established at <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://fullelite.com/">[10]</a>. The banner contest for /v/ and /vip/ begins its voting phase.</li>

<li>November 4 - Hiro takes a modified 4chan logo (now featuring a picture of Keksandra, [s4s]'s board-tan, checking 'em) from a malicious ad-reporting thread on /qa/ and makes it the new homepage image, as suggested by a user. [s4s] celebrates, while some /a/ and /qa/ members complain that Keksandra is replacing Yotsuba. A few hours later on /b/, Keksandra gets sexts and declares herself the new mascot of 4chan, causing a slight meltdown. The thread is filled with dubs checking and Keksandra porn.</li>
<li>November 6 - The banner contest finally ends. Every board except /b/, /gif/, /pol/, /qa/, /qst/ and /trash/ has one at this point. /mlp/ also doesn't have one due to the previous controversy.</li>
<li>November 7 - An anon on /vp/ gets his hands on the full version of the upcoming game, Pokémon Moon, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.alice.al/vp/search/tripcode/%21%21fFO0IgPFrv8/order/asc/">leaks a large amount of information before uploading a playable copy the next day</a>, 10 days before the official release date.</li>
<li>November 8 - Donald Trump is elected President of the United States of America. /pol/ goes completely apeshit and celebrates his victory. Two stickies get placed too, with one being the results of the election...</li>
<li>November 9 - ...and the other being an embed video of Trump's victory dance. Meme magic is real once again! Meanwhile, Hiro removes Keksandra from the front page after five days. /pol/'s rolling 2016 Presidential election results sticky breaks the record for most posts in one thread again, receiving 73171 posts in its 23 hours and 53 minutes. This surpassed the Brexit sticky by nearly 15000 posts.</li>
<li>November 16 - After confirming that he goes to McMaster University (having gotten most of their IPs banned from 4chan) and being dumb enough to leave his full name and email on the manifesto he released in 2014, Barneyfag is doxxed by a /v/ user. His name is revealed to be Lee Goldson, and his pictures confirm how much of a disgusting shit we all imagined he looked like. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://pastebin.com/xN3mtfE8">See here for his info</a>.</li>
<li>November 18 - /vp/ reaches its <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/vp/thread/29999052/#30000000">30000000th post</a>, an image of Lana, a new loli character.

While not quite making up for the disappointment, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://boards.fireden.net/a/thread/149999999/">149999999</a> is taken by loli.</li>
<li>November 23 - A few minutes before midnight EST, /pol/ hits the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/99995014/#100000000">100M GET</a>, the fifth board in the history of the site (after /b/, /v/, /a/ and /vg/) to reach such milestone. And surprisingly, it wasn't stolen by a Leaf.</li>
<li>November 26 - /g/'s /ptg/ general hacks into the admin account of a private BitTorrent tracker, and the login info is posted. Many lulz were had before the staff shuts the site down.</li>

<li>December 12 - Might not be worth mentioning, but <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/102746387/#102756099">/pol/ issued a "Deceleration" of War on the island nation of Tuvalu.</a></li>
<li>December 15 - Apparently Lanzer returns to Gaia, /v/ has a thread about it which housed nostalgiafags and the like.</li>
<li>December 16/17 (Midnight) - /pol/ gets into conflict with either the manager or a mod who wants to delete the /diy/ threads, Hiro had greenlighted the threads however so it put /pol/ against the mod and /qa/. Again.</li>
<li>December 18 - Cirno visits /pol/ and promises a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/103333333/">frosty inauguration.</a> She was blushing too, well, at least according to her filename.</li>
<li>December 19 - The manager (wrongefully displays "mod" instead of manager on desuarchive) makes <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/894474/">a sticky on /qa/</a> detailing the firing of a mod (later confirmed to be modcat/a-san through IRC) for giving someone a politically charged custom warning, also explaining that the right wing safety squad (a /pol/ general named /diy/, named after the venues they look into, not the board) threads are not valid for the board. Also /pol/ is NEVER EVER getting deleted.  <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/897686/#899157">The mod later shows up in another /qa/ thread about the matter to explain himself.</a> /pol/ entered HAPPENING status about an hour after as some Russian dude got assassinated and a couple of attacks happened in Europe.</li>
<li>December 22 - Mirroring the events of November 4, Hiro puts the modified logo featuring Keksandra back on the front page of the website, at the request of a user. Only this time, Keksandra is wearing Santa's hat. 'tis the season to be dank.</li>
<li>December 25 - Christmas hats are added again.</li>
<li>December 28 - Hiro removes (You)s and Christmas hats. Todd &amp; his sinister /pd/ is finally defeated by the /b/tards along with their leader, Caco. It was a long couple of months full of insulting, purging, doxing, &amp; hacking one another. Todd finally threw in the towel as he was losing fags left &amp; right, to the point even his own "bestfriend" turned on him. When Todd was vulnerable Caco took over his Group, /pd/, &amp; continuously spammed it with pictures of his Mother (who was found out to be into amateur porn film-making) resulting in a lulzy rage-quit from Todd. The /b/ Chatroom was safe from the hands of faggotry once again.</li>
<li>December 29 - A poll feature is added to the site. 4chan passes are required to prevent rigging. The first poll apart from a test is whether (You)s should be re-added,</li>

<ul><li>January 10 - /pol/ tricks John McCain, Rick Wilson, Buzzfeed and the CIA into believing scat fanfiction about politicians as fact, fooling many. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/PDpKd">Relevant Image.</a> Archive: [<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/kQpfx">1</a>], <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/d8xdG">[2</a>]</li>
<li>January 17 - /a/ manages to decode the witch script in Little Witch Academia, which impresses the English PR guy for Trigger, Tattun, so much he starts posting on /a/. Mods being Mods ban him for no reason, after 30 minutes they say it was mistake and apologize, and then sticky the thread for a few minutes, then make it so that the thread can't be bumped off the index or hit its image limit.</li>
<li>January 20 - Donald Trump is officially inaugurated as President of the United States. /pol/ celebrates endlessly and laughs at liberal tears. Swaglord makes a visit in the sticky, posting a picture with the caption "WE PRESIDENT NOW". The only sad note of the day is the announcement of Gabe the Dog's death, where /wsg/ honors his <s>memory</s> memery by posting Gabe remixes. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/mNA6T">moot also posts about it on his Twitter</a>, the first anyone's heard from him in months. Also, to protest Donald Trump's presidency, (((Shia LaBeouf))) sets up a 24/7 live stream "art" exhibit called "He Will Not Divide Us" in the heart of New York City, with the goal of live-streaming people chanting the stream name in solidarity. /pol/ and /tv/ host threads on the stream, and within hours, people arrive to meme IRL and causes shenanigans.</li>
<li>January 21 - Tattun visits /a/ again to announce that the show's producer has agreed to visit for a AMA in a few days. He sticks around for several hours to answer questions. Mods show up to give him a 4chan Pass at Hiro's request. Users from /pol/ continue to raid the HWNDU stream by shouting "Pepe!" and playing Shadilay. One brave /pol/ack plasters the name of KEK on the side of a building.</li>
<li>January 24 - In a few days, the HWNDU stream trolling becomes more sophisticated, ranging from uttering meme phrases and ordering tendie delivery, to non-stop Eurobeat music DJ's and anti-Semitic picture drawing. Even CIA and Moonman cosplay make an appearance. Because the trolls are 'mostly harmless', many reappear as regulars on the stream, and are universally loved by the thread lurkers. The two most popular regulars are "Jackie4chan", the delightfully vanilla 4chan browser, and "/pol/ Blart", the policeman dead-ringer for Paul Blart.</li>
<li>January 25 - /a/ gets their AMA with Trigger. Notable highlights include yurifags being BTFO and the producer laughing when asked if one of the characters is a virgin. The Verified capcode shows up for the first time. An example can be found <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://desuarchive.org/a/thread/156559433/#156563785">here</a>.</li>
<li>January 26 - Days earlier, after constant trolling, Shia snaps and pushes an offending crowd member. On this day it was announced he was arrested and charged with assault. Ironically, one of the stream regulars, dubbed "Tony" for his loud Italian voice and aggressive debating, was removed from the premises by police. Even more ironic was the reveal that another troll "Adidasbro" had an arrest warrant, suspected to be related to playing Johnny Rebel and Moonman music in public. Lastly, topping the ultimate in irony, both demonstrators AND trolls find themselves having a civilized debate in an unbelievable moment of unity, proving once and for all that Shia LaBeouf is a fucking joke.</li>
<li>January 28 - The HWNDU stream hits critical chaos, as trolls outnumber demonstrators. In a successful effort to kill the memes and restore order, the property owners only allow people to speak group-by-group. They enforce this by erecting a fence, because irony is not their strong suit.</li>
<li>January 30 - Disney announces that it'll be closing Club Penguin in late March. /v/ decides to give it one last raid for old time's sake. Swastikas were made, memes were spammed, and keks were had.</li>
<li>February 5 - /pol/'s 111111111 GET predicts Trudeau will fall. This is incorrect.</li>
<li>February 6 - /tv/ Anon(s) begin counting down the days until Avatar 2's release date. Time will tell if he/they are able to keep it up.</li>
<li>February 10 - Small changes are made to 4chan's archives: The latest archived threads now are viewable for only 3 days rather than 7, and the post count for each archived thread is removed. If you have a direct link to a thread you can view threads past 7 days old; It is yet to be seen how far back this is possible with some of the older threads archived at around 17 days (as of 2/21/2017). Easily demonstrated with threads that have "previous thread" in the OP.</li>
<li>February 11 - Shia's HWNDU project is shut down by the museum. /pol/ celebrates.</li>
<li>February 16 - Hiro finally removes Christmas Keksandra from the 4chan homepage and replaces her with Sachiko Koshimizu, after many requests from /qa/.</li>
<li>February 17 - HWNDU returns, this time in Albuquerque, NM. Within days, /pol/ trolls the project all over again, even spray-painting over the camera whilst putting up graffiti.</li>
<li>February 21-22 - Image posting goes down on the entire site. /qa/nts suspect that Hiro wants to ban mobileposters. The theory is dropped after some Anons report that they can't post images from their PCs. Posting also fails to work for periods of time in different places, from the entire globe to single countries.</li>
<li>February 22 - Hiro finally took notice of the glitch and fixed it. The only explanation about it is that it was a "site issue" which really doesn't explain much. The glitch also killed many images over many boards, resulting in image dump threads becoming wastelands. Many stickies are now devoid of pictures and are eventually replaced.</li>
<li>March 6 - Someone on /b/ posts a mobile chatlog of a 19-year-old German who murdered the 9-year-old child of his neighbors. The log shows the murderer sharing explicit gore images of the victim with his friend. Said two participants are talking about uploading it on 4chan. The murderer claims to be suicidal and he doesn't want to work anymore. As of March 7, he is still on the run. German media reported about the case.</li>
<li>March 7 - Apparently, the German murderer killed another person, a middle-aged woman, and uploaded images of it on /b/. This has yet to be confirmed.</li>
<li>March 8 - The German killer starts up another Q&amp;A thread on /b/, this time he even posted some sort of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://pastebin.com/raw/KWXkSuJx">manifesto</a>, confirming that he is "Maruseru" and that his bodycount is now 5. A possible German police officer posts with a timestamp in the same thread, however, he referenced /b/'s famous board subtitle text in another image. The killer claims he's going to post another thread on the 9th at 9pm. 4chan gets namedropped and showed in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://a.yiff.moe/zpzzli.webm">German television</a>. Also, mods start a crackdown on /qa/'s spambots, which is not received well by some users.</li>
<li>March 9 - Maruseru gives up after burning a house and killing two people again for unknown reasons. At 9pm, he stormed into a diner and asked them to call the police. He was arrested, /b/ is split between cheers and tears. Shia's HWNDU project goes live again on March 8, this time in a completely unknown location. The stream simply broadcasts a flagpole with a white flag saying "He Will Not Divide Us", in front of nothing but the sky. Within 24 hours, /pol/ correctly triangulates the whereabouts of the flag, based on what was available from the stream, including plane routes, star patterns, bird calls, frog croaks, wind direction, the position of the sun, playing marco-polo with an anon's car horn, and pure autism power.</li>
<li>March 10 - The flag is removed by an unknown /pol/ user and replaced by a MAGA hat and Pepe shirt for fifteen minutes, before it's removed by someone else. The stream shuts down 25 minutes later. /pol/: 3, Shia: 0. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.fo/YO8u3">The anon then collected the flag and put it on display.</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://imgur.com/a/yMnot">[12]</a></li>
<li>March 13 - Audio webms have been enabled on /r/ and /wsr/.</li>
<li>March 20 - (((Rockfeller))) dies on World Frog Day and Barron Trump's birthday, /pol/ litters their catalog with celebratory threads.</li>
<li>March 22 - Shia LaBouef, still learning nothing, sets up his HWNDU project for the fourth time, this time hosted in Liverpool, England. Within an hour, a terrorist attack happens in London, resulting in the death of four people. As the happening continues, /pol/ quickly figures out where the flag is.</li>
<li>March 23 - An anon in Liverpool makes it to the top of the building, fails to remove the flag and the police are called. The anon gets away and the museum shuts down the exhibit once more at the advice of the police.</li>
<li>March 23,24,25 - A scriptfag manages to steal 3 consecutive GETs just to make the /b/tards drink their asses off. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://archived.moe/b/thread/726555555">[13]</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://archived.moe/b/thread/726666666">[14]</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://archived.moe/b/thread/726777777">[15]</a></li>
<li>March 29 - Shia LaBeouf, after getting BTFO for the fourth time by /pol/, moves his project to Finland and changes the name of his project from HWNDU to AloneTogether. This project consists of him, Rönkkö (the Finnish semen demon) and Turner living in separate wood cabins on the isolated island of Lapland. During this time, Shia and Co. will have no access to phones, computers etc. The only way they can communicate with the outside world is through a small video chat that is linked with the Kiasma Museum from Helsinki, where visitors can talk with them. This project is planning to start on 12 April and last for about a month.</li>
<li>March 29, 30 - Club Penguin shuts down, /v/ has one final raid for the purple republic before it shuts down and then looks back on it all.</li>
<li>April 1 - Reddit adds a new subreddit called /r/Place, essentially a big pixel canvas where every account can put down one pixel every 5 minutes. /pol/, upon hearing about it, begins to raid it and spam Pepes and Tranny Flags. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/pol/thread/119148066/rpg-rplace-general-assault-edition">The inaugural thread</a> (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/pol/thread/119148066/">and an archived version</a>). Boards are merged as an April Fools joke, resulting in: /can/ - Animals/Cute, /cock/ - Comics &amp; Cartoons &amp; Cooking, /fap/ - Fashion &amp; Photography, /fitlit/ - Well-Rounded Citizens, /mo/ - Mecha &amp; Auto, /mtv/ - Video Killed The Radio Star, /mlpol/ - My Little Politics, /outsoc/ - Outdoor Socialization, /spa/ - Tanoshii Sports and /vint/ - International Vidya.

Swaglord also pulls of the greatest ruse in history, stickying what seemed to be a link to a future get, but when clicked leads to a secret duckroll thread <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://archived.moe/s4s/thread/5273416#p5273416">[17]</a>. Barneyfag gets banned on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/1194185/#1195824">/qa/, twice</a>. An idiot on /b/ also got banned <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://thebarchive.com/b/thread/727637878">thrice for using 8cuck</a>. /cock/ got a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/cock/thread/22398">McChicken sticky</a> and also <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://my.mixtape.moe/vqziez.png">this entertaining thread</a>. /fitlit/ had a thread stickied. /vint/ celebrated getting its dubs back. Flags on /spa/ revealed that a large number of /a/ users were from South America. For first few hours, /mlpol/ was in a bloody civil war, but soon /pol/ realized /mlp/'s horse porn have chased away many low effort threads and actual discussion starts to take place amongst floods of pony porn. /mlp/ and /pol/ both share their interests and autism, and become best friends</li>
<li>April 2 - After the merge was undone, /pol/ goes back to full shitpost mode. Quality in discussions suffer in /a/ as a result of the flags, posters are accused of being Canadian or South American when they state an unpopular opinion; /a/ risks devolving into /pol/. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/s4s/thread/5277777">The 5277777 GET (which is a reply to swaglord's April Fools Peek) actually occurs and is stickied on s4s</a>.

<li>April 12 - The first day of Shia's "AloneTogether" project. Finnish /pol/acks begin to visit the museum and fuck around with Shia and Co. Some /pol/acks pose in front of the cameras doing the CIA pose. Some /pol/acks managed to make Shia say "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" on the livestream chat and also tell a strange story about his childhood toilet trauma. Shia goes berserk.</li>
<li>April 13 - /pol/ has another session of trolling but this time,the security is much tighter and after 10 minutes, they get kicked out. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8MxelBXt2g">One managed to walk around in front of the cameras while wearing a frog mask before a guard kicked him out.</a> The Twitter hashtag for the event gets leaked on /pol/, resulting in a shitstorm visible on a television inside the museum.

<li>August 8-17 - /tv/ latches on to Sneedposting, referencing the wordplay gag "Sneed's Feed &amp; Seed - Formerly Chuck's" from The Simpsons. Fa/tv/irgins gather to theorize the real meaning of the gag, discussing the history of Chuck and Sneed as well as trying to figure out why Sneed turned Chuck's Fuck &amp; Suck into a seed-selling business. The meme takes over every non-Sneedposting Simpsons thread and soon spreads to other threads on the board.</li>

<li>October 21 - An anon on /v/ known as 4chanleaker as his Switch name or Brainlet, finds an copy of Super Mario Odyssey and decides to leak the game. People on the thread think he's lying, but then he streams the intro and posts screenshots and the show begins. Brainlet keeps streaming for hours while anons laugh out the game for being too empty and bland. Meanwhile on NeoGAF a huge drama takes loose where the owner of the site has been accused of sexual assault against a woman. Users get banned, staff members step down (and get banned as well) and the owner has plans to shut the website down. Neogaf gets 404's at least 3 times. A sticky with the message “The NeoGAF scandal and/or bitching about social justice garbage is NOT VIDEO GAMES. Threads posted about it will be deleted and the posters warned or banned. If you want to talk about it go to /pol/. If you want to stay on /v/, then talk about VIDEO GAMES.” gets made on /v/ to move the NeoGAF discussion elsewhere, linking to /pol/, with a picture of moot with a quote "It has the most basic fucking rules: Talk about video games!".<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.oneangrygamer.net/2017/10/4chan-v-bans-discussion-neogaf-sexual-misconduct-scandal/42448/">[29]</a> Mods start removing NeoGaf threads, which result in /v/ finding out that one of the mods named 'Beam' is female single mother who most likely frequents NeoGaf. /v/ users get confused, since NeoGaf is a big video game board, which resulted in /v/ migrating to /pol/ to talk about NeoGaf. Due to the overwhelming shitposting about NeoGaf on /pol/, /pol/ users get mad and help /v/ users who want to celebrate NeoGAF's death start shitposting on /v/. Shitposting commenced, with either /v/ posting John Morris "He does it for free" meme, and just straight up NeoGAF posting, which of course resulted in bans. The event would result in half of the United Kingdom and parts of Canada to get temporarily ISP banned. /a/ gets a new rule, low-effort, catchphrase and template threads are now banned. Statements from various mods on IRC confirm that generals are allowed again, they just should follow the new rule.</li>
<li>October 23 - Hiro comes on /qa/ and gets asked if he can allow NeoGaf threads on /v/. Hiro than let's a single, stickied thread about the NeoGAF discussion to be allowed on /v/, which resulted in the thread to be more about /v/ laughing at the mods more than laughing/discussing the NeoGAF situation. Later, after more than two years, /qa/ becomes a listed board. [s4s], /r9k/, /vip/ and /qa/, much like /cm/, /hm/, /lgbt/ and /y/, are merged into their own section on the board list.</li>
<li>October 24 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220311171223/https://desuarchive.org/qa/search/subject/welcome%20to%20%2Fqa%2F/type/sticky/">After struggling for a bit,</a> Hiro makes <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220311171106/https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/1654916/">a locked "welcome to /qa/" sticky</a> saying that other than meta topics the board has "no specific theme".

<li>October 31 - /pol/ raids real life by putting up pieces of paper that say "It's okay to be white" in a calm, black font, in response to a police investigation at Boston College over "Don't apologize for being white" signs being placed on their campus. Aiming to prove that the media and the snowflakes will turn the harmless posters into a major shitstorm and out themselves as racists, /pol/ succeeds as usual. Posters are ripped off, school principals explicitly state that the message is hateful, the media shits bricks and /pol/'s point is proven. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT6xWWUgk3TYzwo4XOrRxsEpVeTxHT2vDpfcGs29YGY31jAN7iAB8RjEsoarOXg1EYNUMKZzbvd0flz/pubhtml">Collection of media and snowflake butthurt,</a> as well as a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://ghostbin.com/paste/3g6ks">Ghostbin</a>.</li>

<li>November 19 - /bant/ is on suicide watch after a thread moved from /pol/ gets &gt;&gt;2999999 &amp; &gt;&gt;3000000. many users call for /bant/ to no longer be /pol/'s trashcan.</li>
<li>December 13 - /v/ gets it's 400 millionth post. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/v/thread/399999018/#400000000">It declares Saika Totsuka to be best girl (boy).</a> /v/ experiences full-blown butthurt.</li>

<li>December 18 - /g/ discovers something major. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.rebeccablacktech.com/g/thread/63894609">Three shady new domains, two of which were registered earlier in the month and one of which isn't registered, now show up in ad-blocking extensions.</a> Two of the domains belong to a suspicious Ukrainian company, and filtering out the domains ruins 4chan's CSS. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/1794456">Later investigation of the malware-ridden advertisements</a> shows that the Ukrainian domains host a variant of the Nemucod ransomware. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.rebeccablacktech.com/g/thread/63922522">Word is passed around that Hiro was hired by MGID</a> to put these ads on 4chan, and that the payload added to 4chan is being used to data-mine or mine crypto.</li>
<li>December 20 - Hiro (presumably) blocks Desuarchive's IP address from both the a.4cdn.org and i.4cdn.org servers, rendering it unable to archive. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/desu/thread/2700/">rbt.asia and yuki.la also appear to be showing similar issues.</a></li>
<li>December 24 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/a/thread/166165240/#166165240">/a/'s collabarative redraw of the Daicon IV OP is finished.</a> [<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G93bj1HARA4">video</a>]</li>

<ul><li>January 1 - The Q poster, now going with the tripcode "ITPb.qbhqo" (using #Matlock), <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/155169876/#155173632">drops his LARP</a> and confuses the fuck out of the schizophrenics obsessing over him. This possibly occuring due to an imitator becoming active on 8chan. He declares his favorite 2hu to be Fujiwara no Mokou and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/155175394/#155175394">makes one last thread</a> where he freely gives out the trip. What continued on 8chan would later mindbreak every other boomer in the USA, turning this into technically one of the largest trolls ever performed.</li>
<li>January 5 - Janitor applications open for the next 48 hours.</li>
<li>January 16 - A new sticky with an <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSQdugNM-0M">embedded video</a> appears on /bant/.</li>
<li>January 22 - Image posting is broken site-wide for over 18 hours. The blame is put on Cloudflare although no one really knows what's up. Anonymous is converting images to braille characters <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/a/thread/167454731/">(example)</a> and swaglord embeds a few images <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/tv/thread/93602516/#93603384">here and there</a>. Since threads rarely prune, this allows different boards to compete for who can have the most posts in one thread before they die.</li>
<li>January 23 - 4chan disables Legacy Captcha support, forcing all users to use Google's broken garbage Captcha for every post from now on. Users are not pleased. Anon <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/BgALo">starts</a> a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://files.catbox.moe/0js2s2.jpg">wildfire</a> in Mexico.

<li>January 29 - Hiro does an exquisite šhïtpõśt on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/FsDLi">/v/</a>.</li>
<li>January 31 - Hiro posting on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/VphZ3">/qa/</a></li>
<li>February 1 - Bitcoin begins to crash, hard. swaglord shitposts about it on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/ZzV2P">/biz/</a>, cryptocentral in case you didn't know. /biz/ Goes on full suicide watch mode, resulting in spams of red angry faced wojaks usually screaming or reciting sad/angry lyrics from various songs, such as LinkinPark, Guns N, Roses, and Nirvana. A mod (likely swaglord) continues the recent mod shitpost spree on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/ny9iM">/b/</a>. Public bans rain from the sky once more like the good old days.</li>
<li>February 4 - Ekureiru goes to Gensokyo. He was a good lad.</li>
<li>February 8 - Reminiscent of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/3thkj">a year ago</a> Hiro gets <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/kj2eG">another ad</a> placed on the 404 page, tying into some video game called <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://global.grandsummoners.com/?page=4chan">Grand Summoners</a>. It advertises "paper 4chan money" for people with a pass.</li>
<li>February 15/16 - Some kid shoots up a school in Florida. The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/V0EDa">mainstream media</a>, eager for anything to spice up their story, come to 4chan. Since everything posted is of course true and factual, they are immediately pumped full of misinformation and made a gigantic national laughing stock by /pol/. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://i.imgur.com/4lHJWaj.jpg">Picture.</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/160593952/#160594607">4Plebs.</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/awZFg">Archive.</a></li>
<li>February 20 - 2hu fags at /jp/ celebrate the birth date of their prison as idolfags and javfags generals continue to infest the board.</li>
<li>February 27 - After many years of its absence, Harmony Day makes a triumphant return to /v/. A <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/v/thread/408214404/">sticky</a> with <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MC0G-Lbuuk">autoplayed music</a> and a gif of rainbow Yaranaika are posted. Happiness and joy abound for the few hours it's up.</li>
<li>March 3 - Billy Herrington, Aniki, dies. Threads and stickies are made on many boards, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://warosu.org/jp/thread/18528505#p18528505">/jp/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/v/thread/408619304/#408619304">/v/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/a/thread/169274269/#169274269">/a/</a>, even <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.fo/eaktu">/pol/</a>. Hiro posts in /jp/'s sticky and makes a site-wide announcement about it. 4chan and Futaba mourn his death.</li>
<li>March 14 - Stephen Hawking dies. Hiro makes a site-wide announcement, "RIP Stephen Hawking 1942-2018 🙏". <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://find.4chan.org/">The search engine</a> is back without any official announcement. An /r9k/ user streams himself committing suicide via shotgun on YouTube, shortly after holding up a sign that said "Bye R9K".</li>
<li>March 15 - /a/, /b/, /v/ and /vg/ are frozen for over 14 hours. A lot of users flee to /qa/ as a substitute for their own boards making it the second fastest board on the site for a while.</li>
<li>March 16 - The freeze continues and eventually even /pol/, /qa/ and other boards are frozen. An hour later the site works again. The outage lasted this long because <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://twitter.com/4chan/status/974576454787776512">Hiro was sleeping</a>.</li>
<li>March 19 - Several anons from /tv/, /v/, and /co/ edit and revision the wiki of Ready Player One multiple times before the wiki users removed said revisions.</li>
<li>April 1 - 4chan's April Fools joke this year randomly assigns you to 1 of 5 teams based on the sum of your last two IP octets modulo 5. The teams are Team Creme, Team Mini, Team Peep, Team Peanut Butter, and Team Chocolate. A bar graph of each team's 'score' is shown in the announcement. It is not clear how this score is influenced, these scores are most likely predetermined and updated at regular intervals. The confused panic that resulted rendered most big boards almost completely unusable. In the end, Team Peanut Butter won and the winners got rickrolled.</li>
<li>April 2 - Many reported sadness due to the fact they'll never see their queens again.</li>
<li>April 4 - First known post of a robot claiming to be blackmailed by a user known as Reiko. This is the start of a trend pertaining to trap "harems" in related discord servers, but information on whether blackmailing and such is actually prevalent is still unknown.</li>
<li>April 13 - Many boards have been frozen for over 7 hours. Reason unknown so far.</li>
<li>April 15 - Actor Ronald Lee Ermey passes away due to complications related to pneumonia. An site-wide announcement gets made with the text: "R.I.P. Ronald Lee Ermey." Mods sticky <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/bant/thread/4789876/">another embedded video</a> on /bant/.</li>
<li>April 20 - Mods finally crack down on soyposting and add wordfilters. "soy" is now filtered to "onions", and any word with "soy" in it will turn it into "based" (e.g. soyboy becomes basedboy). As of April 29, /ck/ does not seem to have these filters. Later during the day, /co/ joins the big guys club with its <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/co/thread/99986250/#100000000">100M GET</a>. Swedish musician Avicii dies at the young age of 28, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.rebeccablacktech.com/mu/thread/79536153">resulting in a sticky on /mu/.</a></li>
<li>April 24 - Many boards are frozen yet again for an unknown reason. After around 8 hours 4chan works again.</li>
<li>April 25 - Yet again many boards are frozen for unknown reason.</li>
<li>April 28 - The oekaki is added to /vip/.</li>
<li>April 29 - Image uploading stops working site-wide, intermittently. An option to start threads with no picture is added on all boards except /f/<a href="/index.php?title=Template:Cite&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Cite (page does not exist)">Template:Cite</a>. A thread is stickied on /qa/ saying <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/2061327/#2061327">"this is a text board now."</a> Later in the day, image posting worked again, but the option to start a thread without an image remained as the developers worked on applying a "more permanent fix."</li>
<li>April 30 - Image posting still worked, but it's still being touched up in the background. The option to start a new thread without an image has now been removed from all boards except for /a/, /b/, /v/, /vg/, and /pol/. A short time later, the aforementioned boards caught up.</li>
<li>May 11 - Mods officially <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/s4s/thread/6680508">endorse Merulaposting</a>.</li>
<li>May 15 - An website for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 gets made with the game name and an possible hint or date. Because of this, an sticky gets made on /v/ and quickly goes past the 1000 post mark.</li>
<li>May 22 - /b/ goes into seizure mode, with mods making a thread about "<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://image.ibb.co/ib3KrT/b_happening.gif">SWEET RAVE FURRET</a>" and a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zchf7_5cnbw">techno remix of "Gangster's Paradise"</a> in the background. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/b/thread/769349085">Archive link</a></li>
<li>May 29-30 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/vp/thread/35690955/">Screenshots appear on /vp/</a> of what seems to be the 1997  Spaceworld demo of Pokemon Gold.</li>
<li>May 31 - Some based Anon <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/vp/thread/35736202/#35737816">drops the full ROM</a> of the Pokemon Gold Spaceworld demo, which contains a whole bunch of unreleased content including scrapped Pokemon. This is the first thing released from wack0's hack of Nintendo, the rest of which surfaced in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Nintendo_data_leak">2020 "Nintendo Gigaleak"</a>. Happenings are summarized <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/FR0jG">here</a>.</li>
<li>June 2 - Loss was posted 10 years ago. /v/ gets a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/v/thread/418383831/">sticky.</a></li>
<li>June 4 - Site dies A G A I N</li>
<li>June 12 - E3 2018 begins. Super Smash Bros Ultimate is shown off, and /v/ goes crazy. /v/ gets a sticky after Ridley is announced for the game.</li>
<li>June 18 - /tv/ reaches 100,000,000 posts. The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/tv/thread/99999999/">99999999 GET</a> being a confused Sneed sign thread, and the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/tv/thread/99997359/#100000000">100000000 GET</a> being a comment saying "why can't we just talk about movies". Perhaps the most board defining GETs imaginable.</li>
<li>July 8 - An anon on /v/ <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arch.b4k.co/v/thread/423541124/">makes a thread</a> about Recycle City, an HTML game for kids made by the Environmental Protection Agency that uses the underground theme from Yoshi's Island DS. Anons partake in lulz as they flood the leaderboard with funny names; they quickly discover how poorly secured it is and edit its code to give themselves impossibly high and low scores. After they have their fun and the thread dies, the game's music is changed to some chiptune and the leaderboard is cleared.</li>
<li>August 2 - Hiro starts a contest to design a 4chan Vtuber, with the winner receiving a lifetime 4chan pass.</li>
<li>August 6 - The report function now lists a drop-down menu which allows reporters to specify what rule a user broke, rather than a single checkbox to indicate a broken rule.</li>
<li>August 21 - Stefán Karl Stefánsson (Robbie Rotten) dies. /tv/ gets a sticky.</li>
<li>September 7 - Terry Davis is confirmed to be dead. /g/ gets a sticky in his memorial and his picture is added to the regular /g/ sticky.</li>

<li>September 18 to 19 - PD, a prominent /bant/ namefriend known for entering private property and posting photos of his antics on /bant/, is snitched on by 'Normie' after vandalising an art gallery. Gets a visit from the sheriff, and teases the possibility of going to jail. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://thebarchive.com/bant/thread/6467696/">Initial Thread</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://thebarchive.com/bant/thread/6475915/">Follow-up</a></li>
<li>October 1 - 4chan celebrates its 15th birthday. Voting for the 4chan Vtuber opens. By midnight, the site crashes for reasons unknown and remains unusable to the masses for a span of roughly 15 hours.</li>
<li>October 8 - Nine years after first promising to do it, Jason Scott <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1049369826190352389">finally releases a huge archive</a> containing all 4chan posts from 2006 to 2008. No images though; only text. In it, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/9mkms3/hi_this_should_be_the_first_iteration_of_the/">a redditor finds</a> the first ever SCP Foundation post.</li>
<li>October 10 - /pol/s <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/188888888/">188888888 GET</a> is shit.</li>
<li>October 14 - /wsg/s obession with TikTok and a girl (boy) called Bonbibonkers eventually leads them into <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVKMLdXDlEI">conflict with a group of Russians from 2ch's /fag/ board</a>. At some point people started trying to dox Bonbibonkers and inadvertedly ressurected Ricardo Milos and DotA (by basshunter) into one meme. In the end, Bonbibonkers had to leave TikTok and the internet in general. It was for the better.</li>
<li>October 24 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/24/18019464/4chan-anon-anime-haruhi-math-mystery">Someone discovers an old /sci/ post from 2011 that may have wound up solving a 25-year old mathematical problem.</a></li>
<li>October 30 - The CSS theme gets changed to the spooky Halloween theme once again.</li>
<li>November 11 - /b/ gets flooded with bees for hours. Mods are working full time, deleting threads as they appear, resulting in /b/ only having around 30 active threads for some time which briefly raised suspicion of Hiro cut number of total threads to reduce traffic.</li>
<li>November 12 - Stan Lee dies. /co/ gets a sticky in his memorial.</li>
<li>November 16 - The 4chan Twitter account makes a cryptic <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/NzhIu">tweet</a>: "A test will run."</li>
<li>November 17 - D-Day hits 4chan: An announcement is made sitewide, approximately nineteen hours after the tweet: "Attention: All work safe boards are soon going to be on the 4channel.org domain. For now, all boards are accessible through either domain. Make sure to update your script blockers and whitelist the new domain." The whole of 4chan loses its collective shit. /qa/ receives a flood of shitposting related to the news, resulting in a massive spike in activity that temporarily makes /qa/ the fifth fastest board on the site. Hiro answers questions in a /qa/ thread, indicating that the move was due to 4chan.org being on a blacklist from advertising, and that having a domain to host the worksafe boards would bring about advertising once more. The "delete /pol/" oldfag renew their tirade by threatening to report /pol/posting on 4channel.org to advertisers in order to get the new domain blacklisted. swaglord stickies a petition on [s4s] demanding that they move to 4channel and become a blue board and avoid company with the NSFW boards.</li>
<li>November 20 - Sachiko is removed from the front page.</li>
<li>November 23 - The split is completed. All SFW boards automatically redirect to 4channel and the board list at the top only shows SFW boards.</li>
<li>November 27 - Stephen Hillenburg, creator of Spongebob, dies. /co/ and /tv/ get a sticky.</li>
<li>December 6 - An anon on /g/ buys the domain for linux.org and proceeds to dox a tranny</li>
<li>December 12 - Posting "The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region" now results in a one day autoban <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/2488961/#2489091">due to an anti-Chinese copypasta containing it being spammed.</a> Threads are made tricking people into posting it to get them banned.</li>
<li>December 19 - The JSON API gets severely rate limited, only updating every 30 seconds or so.</li>
<li>December 20 - /fit/ and /g/ are unexpectedly nuked of all their threads. It turns out that apparently <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.rebeccablacktech.com/g/thread/69006085/">somebody on /g/ hijacked a janitor's account</a>. Both boards quickly turn into janny mockery, including numerous "JANNY ARE YOU OKAY?" song lyrics.</li>
<li>December 22/23 - a furfag discord organizes a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/pol/thread/197521375/the-furry-posting-is-a-organised-discord-raid">night raid on /Pol/</a>. A bunch of furry porn and lefty thread's end up on /Pol/, owner of discord is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/pol/thread/197519826/lets-see-who-is-messing-with-us">doxxed</a> and the raid cease's.</li>
<li>December 24 - /wsg/ celebrates Christmas Eve as a TikTok girl (boy) called Bonbibonkers publicly returns to the internet in a spectacular Christmas miracle. The hype over this girl results in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/wsg/thread/2563031/">largest /wsg/ thread</a> since the Dodger Leigh threads in 2014.</li>
<li>December 26 - /mlp/ has a christmas themed <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/mlp/thread/33332284/#33333333">33333333 GET</a>.</li></ul>

<ul><li>January 11 - /int/ reaches 100 million posts. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/int/thread/99998559#p100000000">The GET is an Italian posting a picture of a priest.</a> The 99999999 GET, a much better GET, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/int/thread/99999185/#99999999">is claimed by /polska/.</a></li>
<li>January 16 - /pol/ reaches 200 million posts. The post ominously read <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/199996452/#200000000">Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life.

<li>January 18 - 4chan receives its 3 billionth post.</li>
<li>January 22 - A plane carrying soccer team Cardiff City's record signing goes missing. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/sp/thread/90430297/#90430297">A thread is stickied on /sp/</a> a few hours after the news breaks.</li>
<li>January 24 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/201175755">/pol/ kicks off the sequel to It's Okay To Be White.</a> Users print out posters of Nick Sandmann (kid with a MAGA hat who stood and smiled at a Native American and got death threats from journalists and celebrities, even though the full footage released later shows that Sandmann did basically nothing) with the caption "Stand Your Ground" and post them up on campuses. As expected, journalists flip their shit in their articles and shills flip their shit trying to shut the threads down.</li>
<li>January 28 - A new <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://powerad.ai/customScripts/4channel.js">script</a> was added to 4channel, documented first on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/sp/thread/90551436/#90552099">/sp/</a>. It apparently tracks what you view and click on with more precision and attempts to connect what you do with your real world person via google and amazon data.</li>
<li>January 30-31 - /tv/ is raided by a Zootopia-spamming furry. The threads are mainly just pictures of Nick (and some Judy) without a comment, but as the raid continues, a comment is added: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/tv/thread/109260664/">"Steven universe nor does The Sneedsons belong on /tv/".</a> Later, the picture is a generic furry dog with the comment "im bored", then it's Nick again with a comment calling /tv/ "too based to be raided" and promising to raid /mu/ later.</li>
<li>January 31 - The day of unJUSTing: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ct-superior-court/1662208.html">actor Brendan Fraser pays his final monthly alimony to his wife,</a> freeing him from ten years of his shit getting fucked up. /tv/ celebrates his redemption.</li>
<li>February 1 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/2579226">Hiro stickies a thread on /qa/</a> asking users to test "p4", a modified 4chan described as "yet another view of 4chan" which seems to be made for phoneposters. For some reason, this site requires an email registration AND a 4chan Pass (of course Hiro does this) to even make threads or post in threads. Hiro also mentions that /qa/ will soon be unlisted.</li>
<li>February 2 - The new oldest non-sticky thread in 4chan history, a Reibear thread on /i/, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archiveofsins.com/i/thread/421349">dies peacefully after 1668 days.</a></li>
<li>February 22 - /tv/ decides to fuck with Drake Bell again during a Twitch stream of him at a fan meetup. He becomes visibly upset, types out a bunch of insults, and cancels the stream prematurely after witnessing the sheer autistic faggotry from the chatroom. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/385156348##">Stream and comments can currently be found here, highlight is in the last few minutes.</a></li>

<li>March 14 - A /pol/tard Aussie posts his manifesto on Facebook and 8chan and streams himself shooting up a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. During the stream, he says “Subscribe to PewDiePie” and plays Serbia Strong and Gas Gas Gas. His manifesto contains further meme references such as the Navy Seal Copypasta (which Australian media fell for) and reveals his plan to stoke a larger divide beteeen the left and right. Fifty people are killed. The 17 minute footage of the stream is shared across 4chan, 8chan, and Liveleak, resulting in three New Zealand ISPs blocking the sites. Blue checkmarks stand on the bodies to renew their “shut down 4chan” narrative, even though 4chan technically has nothing to do with the shooter. PewDiePie is also dragged through the mud by the media. Calls to delete /pol/ ramp up again, although this will still never happen. [s4s] “officially” declares that they don’t want anything to do with /pol/ and cut ties with them.</li>

<li>March 18-19 - Multiple New Zealand and Australian ISPs begin blocking 4chan, 8chan, Kiwi Farms, Liveleak, Zerohedge, archive.is, archive.fo, Gab, Voat, xyzchan, and many others, depriving shitposters their right to sick bantz. The ISPs claim that these are temporary blocks and that websites which take action and remove the Christchurch footage will be removed from the block. Some only block at the DNS level, leading to easy workarounds by changing the DNS to OpenDNS or Google DNS. Others ISPs block at the IP level, leading to Tor and VPN usage.</li>

<li>June 12 - After a few days of lead-up, discord summerfags kick off a 'revolution' to have porn threads banned from the board. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://s1.desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/qa/image/1560/39/1560391160667.png">/b/tards in favor of the move make anti-porn threads with yellow images and bump dying yellow threads.</a> Porn threads are spammed with pictures of yellow flags, recolored meme images and (rarely) <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/EhcRQ">original content</a> and /b/tards make threads on porn boards to redirect them.</li>
<li>June 13 - Yellowspammers continue the raid into the next day. An unintentional copypasta starts after several yellowposters say they're "actual oldfags from 2008", which is a common lie made up by post 2016 era newfags on 4chan when they read <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://encyclopediadramatica.wiki/index.php/4chan">ED</a> or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/4chan">KYM</a> for the first time. Rumors claim that janitors were pissed off and started deleting yellow threads. A /b/ mod <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/N6YIj">stickies</a> a 10 hour loop of Eiffel 65's "Blue" with the comment "im /b/lue" and publicly bans the first poster for calling the mods faggots. Lolikons are left with no home to go to since lolis were banned on every other board. Not only could loli threads not survive on the board because of the spam itself, the threads also had image limits due to yellowfags bot spamming. After multiple failed loli threads, only getting around 50 replies (mostly filled with moralfag yellowspammers screeching) before 404, a loli thread was made which surprisingly slipped past yellowfags (likely due to bans from mods), although furries still raided/crossposted in it for whatever reason. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/iZMFJ#selection-3112.0-3218.0">The first yellowpost in the thread was public banned</a>, confirming mods <b>do</b> love lolis and <b>do not</b> condone yellowfaggotry. Immediately after this victory from lolicons and furfags on /b/ alike, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/hh8z8">yellowfaggotry slowed down and non-meta porn threads started appearing again</a>. A few hours later, a mod makes a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/bEILT">textless thread</a> on /qa/ with an <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191010052132/https://vocaroo.com/i/s1g91c3d1wqP">invisible audio webm</a> embedded into it, which says the following: "DUHHHHH, CRRRINNGGEE!

The original audio is allegedly from this <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://youtu.be/v5MU5Uycz5w">YouTube video</a> titled "Based.mp4", uploaded on June 11, 2019. Janitors are now trying to seriously clean up the yellow spam on /b/. Yellows continue to spam; the board is now at a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.fo/CXAfT">half yellow half porn ratio</a>.</li>
<li>June 14 - Pornfags are fighting hard against yellowspam on /b/; yellow groups get some help from 8/b/ and other fellow discord teens. The board is still at a half and half ratio for the first half of the day. Yellowfags start fighting each other over "stolen OC" and operations start falling apart; meanwhile on /b/ itself, yellowspam is still active on the board, but roll, rekt, story and sing along threads <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/lipIU">start popping up</a> and get bumped.</li>
<li>June 15-16 - Yellowfags keep pushing schlop and apu threads. Board is now a balance between porn and yellowspam, with the occasional roll or rekt thread.</li>
<li>June 17 - Porn takes up more than half of /b/. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/Bs3pb">Yellowfags are clearly in need of assistance</a>.</li>
<li>June 18 - Majority of yellow spam groups give up. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/ncbTt">/b/ is back to mostly porn and bait threads, with a tiny amount of yellow and meta wannabe oldfag threads</a>.

<li>June 20-21 - 4chan goes down. People flood to 8chan to wait it out. /pol/ theorizes that this is because Iran shot down a US drone. On the day before the release of the Netflix NGE dub, /a/ had 1-3 discussion threads an hour discussing the dub and the impact it's going to have on /a/ for the next couple of weeks. At 3AM EST the dub is released and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/a/thread/189620606/">threads dedicated to the dub immediately start getting submitted</a>. Shinji's VA in the new dub <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/hiRvo">is a tranny</a>, Fly Me To The Moon is removed and certain iconic lines are replaced, which causes every evafag on /a/ to go apeshit.

Etika, known to have had mental health issues, had scheduled an eight-minute suicide note to be uploaded at midnight on June 19, titled "I'm Sorry" (apologizing for his manipulative behavior and never getting help). <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/BSY8L">/v/ gets a sticky.</a> Anti e-celeb anons complain about how mods stickied e-celeb drama since ProJared drama wasn't stickied because the mods said e-celeb drama isnt video games.</li>

The Netherlands cracks down on sites hosting loli/shota material; Sad Panda is hosted in the Netherlands, and is therefore forced to shut down. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/4DLeu">They issue a 12 hour warning to download all of their shota/loli content before they get shut down.</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/LfdyC">/h/ gets a sticky warning everyone to back up all of their favorite h-doujins.</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/N4twl">/h/ gets 4090% activity</a>. Loli, shota and incest doujins are being actively removed before the shut down. Many boards band together to save their hentai, scans, comics, and other such things, or to discuss the events, such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/a/thread/191147220">/a/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/aco/thread/3347468">/aco/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/bant/thread/8443298">/bant/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/co/thread/108947013">/co/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/d/thread/8631222">/d/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/f/thread/3397413">/f/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://warosu.org/g/thread/72045749">/g/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://warosu.org/ic/thread/4035100">/ic/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/int/thread/108930866">/int/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://warosu.org/jp/thread/21761060">/jp/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/m/thread/17647785">/m/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/mlp/thread/34076122">/mlp/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/220712370">/pol/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/2870187">/qa/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/t/thread/894749">/t/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://desuarchive.org/trash/thread/24484657">/trash/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/u/thread/2934105">/u/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/v/thread/471716210">/v/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/vr/thread/5764328">/vr/</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://boards.fireden.net/y/thread/2646441">/y/</a>. Other boards, thoroughly overtaken by newfags or created to contain newfags, celebrate Sad Panda's death, like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/53583048">/r9k/</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/s4s/thread/8013155">/s4s/</a>. After a last ditch run to save everything, the exhentai.org domain goes down on July 26th at approximately 10:12:25am Dutch time, leaving behind a Non Non Biyori ending picture. Activity on /h/ rises, peaking at 6600% at 10:43am and 67.09 posts per minute, temporarily making /h/ the fastest board on 4chan (beating /v/'s 66.48ppm). It lasts only 3 minutes before 4stats.io updates /h/ again, making it drop to 60 posts a minute. On 26th, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/mSR5u">a /g/ anon makes a site-wide backup of Sad Panda.</a> The thread makes it over three times the bump limit. It is however a troll.</li>
<li>August 2 - Psyche. The Panda returns, this time hosted in Moldova, "hopefully permanently". Many /h/ residents thank <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archiveofsins.com/h/thread/5495996/#5496208">the Moldovan Spurdo</a> for his help, while remaining wary and making sure to archive more content. The immediate traffic to Exhentai causes 503 errors to return. A mod posts on a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://desuarchive.org/wsg/thread/2972574#p2975266">/wsg/ thread for bigger webms thanks to the recent filesize limit increase</a> and ups the limit from 5MB to 6MB. /v/'s new buzzword, "cumbrain", is given a word filter on the board ("cumbrain" becomes "gamer").</li>
<li>August 3 - An /mlp/ anon <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/hXkbK">gives Lauren Faust a letter written by the board</a>. The thread proceeds past the bump limit. /a/, /aco/, /co/, /d/, /e/, /f/, /gif/, /h/, /hc/, /hm/, /i/, /ic/, /mlp/, /news/, /pol/, /r/, /s4s/, /soc/, /sp/, /t/, /trash/, /u/, /v/, /vr/, /w/, /wg/ and /y/ all have their image limits increased from 250 to 300, while /qst/'s image limit is increased from 250 to 375. Two mass shooters kill a combined total of roughly 30 civilians in El Paso, TX and Dayton, OH, the former of whom reportedly posted a manifesto on 8chan and claimed to approve of the shooter's actions. Like all mass shootings, politicians and the media in the USA blame 4chan and Trump, stand on the victim's dead bodies to promote gun control, and launch racist attacks against white men. Infamous commie politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweets about 4chan and claims it's the place where radicalized young men go to after radicalization.</li>
<li>August 4 - The SadPanda backup sticky on /h/ passes 73000 posts and officially becomes <a href="/The_largest_thread" class="mw-redirect" title="The largest thread">the largest thread</a> in the history of 4chan, taking the crown from /pol/'s 2016 election sticky. Shortly afterwards, the thread is unstickied and later gets archived. Many begin to pay respects and repeat the iconic statement "through dick, unity." The thread's final post count is of uncertainty. Archived.moe gives a count of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/h/statistics/largest-threads/">73274</a>, while Archive of Sins reports a count of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archiveofsins.com/h/statistics/largest-threads/">74553</a>.</li>
<li>August 5 - Cloudflare reverses its policy and cuts off protection to 8chan, because apparently white supremacy will stop existing once 8chan dies. 8chan struggles to find an alternative and floods to 4chan for the time being. Even Hotwheels himself (the former owner) has had enough of 8chan and demands the current owner to shut the site down, stating that he's sick of dealing with calls from the media every time shit happens and that the site is a "megaphone" for shooters.</li>
<li>August 6 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.fo/v6FZU">Duplicate file bug occurs on /v/</a>. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/dXZpe">/b/ gets a furry sticky/CSS</a>; 7 posts in and there's already a public ban</li>
<li>August 10 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/222518349/">An anon on /pol/</a> spills information about the death of Jeffery Epstein before reporting it to any authorities or press. The post in questioned was then reviewed by the FDNY.</li>
<li>August 11 - After two and a half years of /qa/ effectively being a 2D/Random board due to extensive user moderation, a manager had enough and begins to rangeban anyone posting 2D/Random content on /qa/. Board activity falls by 90% as a result.</li>
<li>August 14 - Shooting in Philadelphia; <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/uFjbz">/pol/ gets a sticky</a></li>

<li>August 22 - /qa/, now moderated, begins to receive public bans similar to /a/: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/GdYHF">public ban</a>. 4chan's boards go down at approximately 12:25am and return half an hour later. Connecting to 4chan appears lethargic with repeated timeouts and Cloudflare issues for hours to come.</li>
<li>August 25 - A Dutch media service called Videoland uploads the remaining episodes of MLP:FiM, including the series finale. /mlp/ goes fucking apeshit and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/KDAnL">gets a spoiler bunker sticky.</a></li>
<li>August 27 - Fight between Frogposters and weebs continues on /qa/. Animeposter makes an anti frogposter thread <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.fo/pt8YB">Mods publically unban him</a></li>
<li>August 29 - Posting on 4chan is fucked. Some posts can get through, but most of the time, it returns a Connection Error. Apparently posts can go through despite the errors, according to some reports. The shittiness continues into August 30 as everybody calls Hiro a gook.</li>
<li>September 4 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/iKDAv">/o/ gets a sticky</a>. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/vp/thread/39900085/">/vp/</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/BPgRl">/v/</a> get Nintendo Direct discussion stickies.</li>

<li>September 9 - /jp/, /a/, /v/, /c/ and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/LdDmW">/bant/</a> celebrate the 10th annual Cirno day; meanwhile on /bant/, a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/U2Nla">cirnoposter tries to get the 99999 GET</a> but is off by one, and a kagposter gets the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.fo/jcfRQ">99999 GET</a>. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/KkBKJ">/bant/ gets a cirno sticky</a> and every single <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/QaJov">frogposter gets public banned</a>.

<li>September 15 - Mods on /g/ remove the Nagoor sticky and replace it with a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.rebeccablacktech.com/g/thread/72758574">Satania sticky</a>, but the mod forgot to put on his nametag; once again the board goes in chaos.</li>
<li>September 16 - Original Stallman /g/ sticky from December 20, 2015 is restored; <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/mZ0nJ">the Terry/Satania sticky are included in the posts below it.</a></li>
<li>September 17 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/yWJ5p">/g/ gets a RMS general sticky</a>. It consists of nothing but bickering for 10 hours, then it later devolves into loliposting and mods don't pay attention.</li>

Just in time for its ninth anniversary /mlp/ gets a sticky after a Russian hacker once again leaks production files, resulting in a total of 434GB leaked and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://s1.desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/mlp/image/1570/82/1570824573538.png">three simultaneous rolling stickies</a> being up at the same time, the other two about the anniversary itself and the previous dutch leaks.</li>

<li>January 25-26 - swaglord has another <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/CRsWb">sticky parade</a> on /s4s/, and makes "respond to my funny thread" a new board meme.</li>
<li>January 26 - Kobe Bryant fucking dies in a helicopter crash, likely caused by the pilot's spatial disorientation from transitioning from VFR to IFR (translation: if you fly into low visibility you'll lose your bearings). <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/sp/chunk/98445212/">/sp/ gets a sticky.</a></li>
<li>January 28 - A shitposter on /qa/ makes a thread saying /vr/'s board name is misleading because the board isn't related to virtual reality games. Hiro comes back from the grave (his last post being a reply to the "test p4" thread on February 2, 2019) and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/Ye1kp">asks</a> "Should we have Virtual Reality board?" Mostly everyone says no and he agrees. Most of the thread is just desperate anons suggesting dumb board ideas and someone who asks hiro to enable noscript captcha, and which he then tells them to buy a pass.</li>
<li>February 2 - /v/ <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arch.b4k.co/v/thread/494776448/">releases</a> Super Mario /v/orld, a collaborative ROM hack of Super Mario World inspired by 2channel's VIP hacks.

The hack receives a very positive reception.</li>
<li>February 3 - /qa/ mods embed loud nigra on the index of /qa/ for roughly two hours, then remove it. (Note: the only evidence of this happening existing is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/eevNv">this thread</a>, which people responded to presumably after the YT embed was removed and just thought it was another nonsense thread with an anime girl thumbnail)</li>
<li>February 5 - /tv/ gets a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/EUuxz">sticky</a> in honor of Kirk Douglas, who had previously been memed for living so long.</li>
<li>February 11-12 - A <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/7mpWC#selection-2429.0-2429.9">/qa/</a>non points out the majority of stickies on 4chan still have santa hats, which are removed the following day.</li>

<li>February 26 - /v/ celebrates 10 years of HARMONY with <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/1PdDG">a sticky</a>. Kazuhisa Hashimoto, creator of the Konami Code, dies and also receives <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/RQvur">a sticky.</a> However, it is quite massively overshadowed by the HARMONY sticky and just barely makes it over 1000 non-deleted posts.</li>
<li>February 28 - Anon finds out that you can submit events to the offical Republican Party website of New Hampshire with no filter. He reports his findings to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/CNJIy">/pol/</a>, which then spends the next few hours <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.ph/tXkw9">trashing</a> the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://imgur.com/gallery/uF4ASHW">website</a>.</li>

<li>March 20 - /v/ hits the 500M GET. The post is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arch.b4k.co/v/thread/499990681/#500000000">"bats are more delicious"</a> in reference to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Madagascar also confirms its first coronavirus case, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arch.b4k.co/v/chunk/500002987/">prompting a /v/ sticky</a> with "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" autoplaying as a reference to the old Flash game Pandemic 2.</li>
<li>March 21 - A <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/OPvYI#selection-963.0-966.0">global announcement is made</a> stating 4chan will switch to HTTPS by default set for March 27th. Kenny Rogers died and gets <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/mu/thread/93874336">a sticky on /mu/</a>. Somehow this sticky managed to stay up for a whole week despite him <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/mu/search/text/kenny%20rogers/start/2012-01-01/end/2020-03-20/page/14/">rarely being discussed</a> on the board.</li>
<li>April 1 - The first April Fools day of the decade begins. The joke starts on /v/; OP says the joke is "no names or tripcodes". An <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/Gz1i8#selection-13785.0-13790.0">anon responds</a> "cope seethe dilate", his username is distorted and the outside of his text box is sickly green. He was then (USER WAS QUARANTINED FOR THIS POST). The next case is from /mlp/; someone makes a meta thread about the no name/trip rumor, and anons in the thread say the prank is gimmicky. A few posts later, an infected user <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/lchNZ#selection-5023.0-5028.0">shitposts</a>. By this point, half of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/OHxbL">/b/ is already infected</a>. A <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/4MFd9">frogposter on /pol/</a> manages to get an even sicklier, more dense green outline around his text box. /a/ gets a quarantine <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/OeyQG">sticky</a>. Each board gets a news ticker; /b/'s <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/LCn0a">infection level</a> is the most critical. Several boards get corona stickies: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/d1rq3">/co/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/XGqaN">/tg/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/251317888#p251317888">/pol/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/ZvUrX">/v/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/tv/thread/131556003">/tv/</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/epTF1">/vp/</a>. /s4s/ gets a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/7klIn">birthday sticky</a>. The index of /int/ gets an embed of a youtube video hiro <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/3hxRa">uploaded</a>; the video itself is a static image of Pepe The Frog with 30 minutes of sirens, gunshots and thunder in the background. It's nothing special, but it does confirm hiro is, in fact, a frogposter, and is the most likely explanation as to why frog spam hasn't been filtered.</li>
<li>April 6 - 4channel gets <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/MtECR">new ads</a>. The ads in question are promoting a YouTube series called <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzHfAEvP2WAbuu_4vCi4kqQ">"The Non-Family"</a>, a presumably-unintentionally creepy South Park knockoff that only has one episode. Since these ads were links to a YouTube video and not the usual sketchy porn site, everyone without an adblocker on 4channel watches The Non-Family and it quickly becomes a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/tv/search/text/non-family/">meme on /tv/</a>.</li>
<li>April 10 - /vp/'s Pokemon Clover, a major ROM hack of Pokemon FireRed, is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RympaeJSUc">officially</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/vp/thread/43250229/">released</a> to a very positive reception.</li>
<li>April 14-15 - A YouTuber by the name of Frank Hassle had been a trendy subject on /tv/ ever since he started his youtube channel, considering he works with Sam Hyde. Most anons shit on his videos, while the small majority say they're kino. But on April 14th, Frank uploads a new video where he messes with people at a crossfitting place. When one of Frank's usual fans made another thread about it on /tv/, an <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/dpbIV#selection-25603.0-25608.0">anon in the thread finds the crossfitting place's facebook page and contacts the owners</a>. Keep in mind, the video was recorded at least 2 years prior (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://youtu.be/2tRBFqGg9mk?t=254">was previously teased in a Sam Hyde video</a>), but nontheless, the owners were infuriated and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/FqdGa">claimed the video</a>. Afterwards, he <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/YV3OZ">privates everything on his channel</a>.</li>
<li>April 21 - Qtard and Twitter moms discover that Googling "tv television and film" and going to Google Images shows a bunch of child model pictures caused by cunnyposter pedophiles posting on /tv/. A minor shitstorm develops. One retarded Twitter wine aunt decides that "4plebs" is a shortened version of "4 pedo celebs". <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/plebs/thread/2480/">4plebs staff make an official statement</a> and assure people that they always delete such pictures from their archives when reported. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/tv/thread/132559790">/tv/ discusses the event.</a></li>
<li>May 1 - Nintendo 64, Gamecube, and Wii SDKs get <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/gjMjl">leaked on /v/</a>. All of the video game emulation and preservation communities go insane. After the news spreads, Nintendo starts DMCA'ing download links posted on /v/ and /vr/.</li>
<li>May 5 - Cinco de Mayo; <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/uaUJO">/a/ gets a Cinco de Maho sticky</a> with <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wztuzAkF0hw?version=3&amp;autoplay=1&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;loop=1&amp;playlist=wztuzAkF0hw">Himeko's Maho Song</a> playing in the background.</li>
<li>May 10-11 - The first TLOU2 leaks start showing up around this time, so /v/ started making templates and edits of the game. The edits were primarily based on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/abby-choke-edits">Ellie getting choked by Abby</a>. These threads were only the beginning for what's to come next.</li>
<li>May 14 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/3213024#p3217654">/b/tards launch a massive raid on /po/</a> to get away from the porn threads. /po/ is ruined for a few hours and many ancient threads are archived. Soon after, /po/'s mods restore the ancient threads.</li>
<li>May 15 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/adv/thread/22222222/">/adv/ gets post 22222222.</a></li>
<li>May 16 - Twelve hours after octs on /adv/, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/sp/thread/100000000">/sp/ gets its one hundred millionth post: Cristiano Ronaldo commenting on someone's piss stream.</a></li>
<li>May 19-23 - /s4s/ gets flooded with cat stickies <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/hOY5f">1</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/sykgx">2</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/Y0ZBD">3</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/XYkAW">4</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/NeZpE">5</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.vn/6ItWX">6</a>. At one point, the board has 17 stickies.</li>
<li>May 22 - Reporting changes so the first report <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/3220559/#3230299">doesn't require a captcha.</a></li>
<li>May 26 - hCaptcha replaces reCaptcha on the report system. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/3230364/#3233667">/qa/ complains.</a> 4chan begins site maintenance at 7:33pm GMT. hCaptcha is mysteriously removed shortly afterwards.</li>
<li>May 29 - 4chan reaches a daily total of one million posts owing to the increase in /pol/ traffic due to riots across the United States. It is the first time since April Fools Day 2020 that 4chan has had one million daily posts.</li>
<li>May 31 - /pol/ gets a new <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/vAQx7">locked sticky</a>, informing people not to post the same twitter screencap thread when it already exists. /pol/ is now at its most active since the 2016 Presidential election, reaching nearly <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://4stats.io/">273 thousand posts in one day</a> thanks to the nationwide George Floyd """protests""".</li>

<li>June 16 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arch.b4k.co/v/thread/512736886/#512739794">A /v/ reply poster gets banned</a> for criticizing the apparent ignorance of the /v/ boards transformation from war positions anti-furry motive to accepting furry posts.</li>
<li>June 18-21 - TLOU2 releases. While critics are having a field day with the game the user reviews turned out to be highly negative and people started bashing the game. /v/ catches wind of the negativity and anons start making various templates of certain cutscenes from the game. One of these in particular is the sex scene where Abby and Owen are fucking each other. One anon began compiling a spreadsheet of every frame in the scene that everyone could claim so that it could be compiled into a video. When the video was finished /v/ got a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arch.b4k.co/v/chunk/513438328">sticky</a>. A huge MEGA collage got made of all the TLOU2 edits as well which can be found <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://mega.nz/folder/onxAEaYZ#Qn9jj34uz4hPdLVSQ7TG6w">here.</a></li>

<li>July 11 - /g/ gets a replacement sticky with no image attached; the same mod that made the thread made a proposal reply offering <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/3DmhP#selection-1489.0-1491.1">/qa/</a> a chance to suggest who's image should be in the next sticky.</li>
<li>July 13 - The mods end up choosing to include Steve Ballmer, Terry A. Davis, Stallman <b>and</b> Satania in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/Rqerk">sticky</a>; an almost year long debate (2019, September 17) has finally concluded.</li>
<li>July 14 - /vp/ turns ten years old; a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/UfC6a">sticky</a> is made, both the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/MxyCq">index of /vp/</a> and the sticky were embedded with a compilation of every Pokemon anime OP in the background.</li>
<li>July 24 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/jFMAA">/vp/ Anon (possibly "wack0"'s friends) once again leaks a shitload of source codes and prototypes of various Nintendo games.</a> Many threads are made on /v/ <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://archive.is/pRpFy">[34]</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber"

<li>July 25 - The leaks don't end. The sourcecode to Mario 64 and Ocarina of Time leaks. The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://hiddenpalace.org/">Hidden Palace</a> discord had to temporarily shut down because of the massive influx of tourists asking for Mario 64 related leaks. The 2 decade+ mystery is finally debunked; <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/jdD2k">L was, and always has been real</a>.</b> The internet shits itself. Some people speculate the release of this leak was on purpose, theorizing "24 + 01 2+4+0+1 = 7 (June), 24 (Day of the leak) + 1 (One day after) = 25".</li>
<li>July 31 - A new board, <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/4ap89">/vrpg/ - Video Games/RPG</a>,</b> is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/02q64#selection-195.0-202.0">subtlety created</a>. The usual <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/dfEa2">shitpost spam on /qa/</a> asking for unnecessary boards runs rampant all day. An anon makes a post asking about new spoiler tags; <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/mg99O#selection-4113.0-4117.6">a mod appears</a> and offers anons a chance to create new spoiler tags.</li>
<li>August 6 - An Elesaposter on /vp/ gets the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/YW0T6#selection-3291.17-3291.18">44444444 GET</a>.</li>
<li>August 7 - Another new video games board, <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/x5ASE">/vmg/ - Video Games/Mobile</a></b>, is created. Initially thought to offload most of the gachashit from /v/ and /vg/, the board does neither and its purpose is unclear. Some mod (or mods) gets fed up with the decline of /b/ and decides to purge the board of shitty porn threads. In an effort that lasts months (and still continues as of October), he publicly bans every porn poster on the board, setting an example for horny zoomers. Since ban frequency drops at certain times of the day, this is probably the work of a single pissed off mod. Porn posters are encouraged to move their threads to /s/ and /soc/, which they largely do; but since /s/ is a slow board, they are not warm to the idea of "girls built for BBC" and "girls you jerk off to" and "social fap thread #325" threads, or the post quality contributed by underage /b/ users. The mod soon gets bored of banning everyone, and mostly stops. /b/ returns to its usually awful state, yet the /b/-tier threads remain on /s/. Along with /asp/ and /vr/, /s/ joins the ranks of boards that were ruined by terrible moderator decisions.</li>
<li>June 26 to August 8 - In response to drama, /mlp/ denizens organize, create, and release an <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.marenheit451.com/">art pack</a> promoting free speech. It results in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H7QyODrLItk44uhj3-t5sIYgoONMc9qmE7NjIAgTjDA">$21,132.94 worth of donations</a>, nearly all going to 3d horses in need, and becomes the most successful art pack in the fandom's history. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://twibooru.org/search?q=verity">Verity!</a></li>
<li>August 14 - <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/U4J5H">/vst/ - Video Games/Strategy</a></b> is created; <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/gFUfU">/qa/ flips shit</a>. Many on /v/ theorize the new boards are the start of an aim by mods to split /v/ up into pieces by genre, but mods refuse to comment.</li>
<li>August 15 - /g/ gets a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.vn/UPALc">sticky</a> celebrating Satania's birthday. Later on, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://files.catbox.moe/5f9sqj.webm">background gifs of dancing cats</a> are added.</li>
<li>August 20 - A thread on /tv/ about the Netflix show "Cuties", featuring underage actresses acting sexually, is replied to by a mod who denounces any sexual imagery from the show and tells them to get perma b&amp;. A fatal blow to cunnyposters. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/tv/thread/138099994/#138100467">[4Plebs Archive</a>] <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/NB9wc">[Archive.is</a>]. The film was already gaining a bad rep in the mainstream, so <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.newsweek.com/4chan-bans-images-netflix-film-cuties-1526545">the media</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1296441745761284096">Twitter users</a> soy themselves over the big bad ebil 4chon banning the film.</li>
<li>August 21 - Waiting through the day, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/LBfHt">/qa/ anons</a> feel like another board is coming up. And the mods answer their prediction, right on schedule. This time it's <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/Ass7i">/vm/ - Video Games/Multiplayer</a></b>. At first, the board isn't even loadable. /soc/ gets the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.vn/wDh5U">name field enabled</a>.</li>
<li>August 23 - /qa/ anons <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/p5apP">collaboratively create</a> a collage which they feel represents the board. After a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/Eo7qq">final version of the collage</a> is decided on, a thread is made featuring the image with the comment "MODS STICKY THIS", <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/HvfLW">and they followed through</a>. Later, a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/oe2wB">music embed</a> (song suggested by an anon in the thread) and a dancing cat gif are added. Shortly after hitting the image limit, the thread is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/Ynu80">unsticked</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/I0xzR">subsequently archived</a> without being allowed to naturally get bumped off of the catalog. There is very rarely any direct interaction between the mods and /qa/, and the sticky is seen as a great surprise by most /qa/ regulars. It is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/1Nd5w">the first user-created sticky on /qa/ in two years</a>.</li>
<li>August 24 - Some weird shit starts happening to /vg/. Each index page increases from 15 to 20 threads, emptying out page 9 and 10 and half of page 8. The post count in each thread does not italicize when the 750-post bump limit is reached (despite autosaging anyway), implying a possible increase of the bump limit. Threads on the index pages do not show the latest replies.</li>
<li>August 25 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/his/thread/9325436/">A /his/torian discovers</a> that more than twenty thousand of the articles on the Scots Wikipedia have been written by an American horsefucker who doesn't even know the language and writes articles in a Scottish accent (and had been doing so since 2013, as a twelve year old). Media picks up on it but credits the cockmunchers at Reddit for uncovering it instead. Many consider it the most damage done to a single language in recent memory, all because of a fucking autistic INTP brony.</li>
<li>August 28 - "New Vidya Board Friday" appears to have ended, but change comes to /vr/. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/vr/thread/6770545">Mods officially announce</a> that sixth generation consoles launched between 1999 and 2001, such as the Xbox, PS2, Game Boy Advance and GameCube, are now "retro" enough for /vr/. Vidya on these consoles released before 2008 is also allowed. Users on the board are divided, with a two-thirds majority (approximately 63% according to an informal straw poll) standing against the change and preferring the creation of /v2k/ instead. Trolls flood the board with shitty 6th gen content, both as a form of protest and for the lulz. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/nIyG1">The new sticky</a> incorporates this update, as well as allowing homebrew console games made in 2008 and beyond on the sixth generation consoles. A mod on /qst/ announces that the board would be getting a new banner, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.vn/knMBW">and is open to submissions</a>.</li>
<li>August 29 - A mod on /qst/ makes and stickies a thread for voting on banners submitted in the previous thread, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.vn/VM7dh">and one is chosen almost unanimously</a>.</li>
<li>August 31 - <i>Suzumiya Haruhi no Chokkan (The Intuition of Haruhi Suzumiya)</i> is announced; /a/ gets a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/XSQga">sticky</a> with embedded Haruhi music and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220131104243/https://iili.io/lr6UeS.png">the catalog gets flooded with haruhi threads.</a></li>
<li>September 4 - On the 30th of August, /pol/ denizens <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/Koojr">doxxed</a> a man called Michael Reinoehl who in popular consensus seemed to have murdered a Trump supporter in Portland, painting a target on him all over the web. After an interview with VICE, the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/WPI8b">man is killed</a> by law enforcement trying to arrest him on Sep 4.</li>
<li>September 5 - A random [s4s] anon makes a thread and received the 9000000 GET; thread is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/7SqjU">stickied</a>.</li>
<li>September 7 - After rumors that the Venture Bros has been cancelled, Jackson Publick confirmed the rumors were true, leaving the series on a huge cliff hanger; /co/ gets a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/8wCpE">sticky</a>. "Like a Friend" by Pulp is played in the background.</li>
<li>September 9 - It's Cirno Day. There are scattered threads all over the boards celebrating Cirno, the ice fairy. On /bant/ <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/2NHln">an image of Cirno and the words "*blocks u're path*"</a> is overlaid on both the index, the catalog and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.is/asDUq">this sticky</a>. This year, /bant/ notably had a much better Cirno Day than /jp/. This is likely due to the coup d'état by vtubers who now own the board and don't know who Cirno is.</li>
<li>September 12 - /jp/ experiences a huge surge in posts due to Hololive threads, becoming one of the fastest boards on the site. Its post rate even passes /b/ at one point.</li>
<li>September 13 - File names change from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/VhOqf">1500000000000 to 1600000000000</a>. While the true 1600000000000 wasn't posted in time, the closest someone got to it was in a German /int/ thread with a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/2X3hg#p130428119">1600000000012.</a></li>
<li>September 14 - The Ms. /co/ 2020 competition experiences a major shitstorm as an anon <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/co/thread/117682027#p117683098">exposes a Spanish Facebook group</a> known as "Random Cartoon" that has been brigading their polls. The group appears to have been encouraging votes for Emmy (Emmy the Robot), as well as others such as Miko Kubota (Glitch Techs), and their heavy favoritism for Spinel in 2019 may have been the reason why Spinel won the previous year's Ms. /co/. It turns out they've also used the competition to steal fanart created by /co/mrades during the event. Some anons call for the disqualification of Emmy and Miko. The tournament organizer suggests redoing the round, others also suggested replacing both characters.</li>
<li>September 17 - /g/entooman got the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.vn/8Fi9K#p77777777">77777777 /g/et</a> and later got banned with (USER INSTALLED GENTOO FOR THIS POST).

<li>September 18 - Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court Justice, dies. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/278112396">/pol/ gets a sticky.</a> /pol/ celebrates by laughing at "NO NO NO" trending on Twitter, posting Twitter and Reddit salt, and watching Democrats melting down and hoping to prevent Trump from adding yet another conservative justice to an already packed court.</li>
<li>September 19 - A /qa/ user who goes by the name <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/fiuRW">Soot</a> creates <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/3484141">soyjak.party,</a> (aka. the sharty) a 4chan syle imageboard centered around soyjak posting and /qa/ culture.</li>

An imposter pretending to be him claims to dig up the jar and shows it, but the pictures are found to have been from 2018. The actual Rainbow Dash Cum Jar guy explains that he moved out while the jar was still buried, so he can't get to it.</li>
<li>September 21 - Microsoft buys ZeniMax, including Bethesda, iD, Obsidian Software and more. An anon makes a post that gets <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/Ppi80">stickied</a> and /v/ goes absolutely apeshit. The consolewar is on.</li>
<li>June 26 to September 22 - KnowYourMeme shitposter Southern Yeehaw starts flooding KYM with soyjak images, causing <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/forums/report-problems/topics/61633-southern-yeehaws-soy-boy-wojak-spam">massive amounts of butthurt</a>. He is soon banned, but a cabal of soyposters on /qa/ <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/3277303">pick up on his efforts</a> and start flooding KYM with soyjaks themselves. KYM is completely inundated with soyjaks for months; as a result, the recent images gallery <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://s2.desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/qa/image/1598/59/1598594844344.png">turns into</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://i.imgur.com/AXVcm3n.png">a giant wall</a> of soyjaks, the soyboy article stays on 'trending' for months, and of course <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://s2.desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/qa/image/1598/97/1598974993451.png">the forums and comments</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/forums/serious-debate/topics/62083-regarding-soyjak-and-soyjak-spams">fill with the seethe</a> of dozens of KYM autists. Though the butthurt from the userbase is unanimous, The Great Soy Flood divides KYM mods: some view it as a great addition of OC and meme documentation and even <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1890465-kym-tan">join in</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/3430771/#3431706">soyposting</a> themselves, while others view it as low-quality spam. Several KYM users rage quit and delete their accounts. Spammers during this time include peanusweanus, grasshopper, and albinorhino. Albinorhino is the most notorious; he manages to upload hundreds of soyjak images without getting banned by uploading only a few a day and keeping them SFW. Also notable is a KYM oldfag, elleichops, who <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/3414594/#3430459">sacrifices</a> his decade-old account to share some nice soyjaks. On September 22, the KYM mods finally agree to crack down on soyjak spam and albinorhino is banned, seemingly bringing an end to the spam. Efforts on /qa/ still continue, however.</li>
<li>September 24 - The longcat thread that has been stickied on /b/ becomes the first ever thread on /b/ to get over 9000 posts. As of September 2024, it is the only thread on /b/ to have ever gotten over 9000 posts, making it the longest thread that /b/ has ever had. Pretty fitting for Longcat.</li>
<li>September 25 - Ron Paul (/pol/'s former Republican idol back when /new/ was a thing) has a stroke-like episode during a livestreamed interview. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/279184817">/pol/ gets a sticky</a> with two videos of the event uploaded to Bitchute. Two hours later, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/279202714">/pol/ gets another sticky</a> with Ron Paul announcing on Twitter that he's "doing fine" in hospital.</li>
<li>September 26 - [s4s] users finish a collage of Longcat drawings and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/cz20x">send it</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/wip/CY6y9">to the owner on Twitter.</a> She goes to the [s4s] sticky <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/WNFMk">to thank them</a> for the image and for remembering Longcat, and sticks around to read their kind words. [s4s] sends her respectful condolences.</li>
<li>September 28 - At some point, the Hololive streamer Coco gets attacked by insect drones from China for daring to mention Taiwan at all. Suddenly, /pol/ was sprawling with Hololive threads until the jannies got them all wiped off the face of the earth. It seems. Meanwhile, /v/ <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arch.b4k.co/v/thread/526512573/">releases</a> Super Mario /v/orld 2: Moot Point, the sequel to Super Mario /v/orld. The hack is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&amp;t=103735">acclaimed</a> and hailed as a masterpiece by those who play it.</li>
<li>October 1 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.4chan.org/4channews.php?all#127">4chan celebrates its 17th birthday</a>; Party Hats are enabled on all boards. Meanwhile, Steve from Minecraft is in Smash. No, really. The meme is real. Among the massive meltdown on /v/, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arch.b4k.co/v/thread/526844941">a sticky emerges and CaptainSparkles's Minecraft parody of "DJ's Got Us Falling In Love" is embedded.</a> The sticky barely lasted an hour.</li>
<li>October 2 - Donald and Melania Trump confirm that they have the coronavirus. /pol/ freaks the fuck out and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/280346889">also gets a sticky.</a> Meanwhile, bunkerchan.xyz (the remainder of 8chan's /leftypol/) considers it wise to raid /pol/ with 'Chudjak', a Wojak of the guy who did the El Paso shooting, which they proclaim a caricature of the typical /pol/ user. Pissing into an ocean of piss leads to you getting pissed back at, and Bunkerchan proceeds to be raided overnight by a few shitposters, a spambot, gore, lolicon, cp and the subversion of the meme they were trying to spam. It gets too much for Bunkerchan mods, and they lock the board. It eventually turns out there's no evidence that the spam started on Bunkerchan.</li>
<li>October 9 - /mlp/ gets a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/qI7BV">sticky</a> in honor of the infamous "this is going to have so much porn" /co/ post becoming a decade old.</li>
<li>October 10 - /mlp/ gets another <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/UpWYc">sticky</a> in honor of the actual 10th anniversary of Friendship is Magic. Later that day, after teasing it on his <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/yRmZ4">Twitter</a>, M.A. Larson, one of the show's script writers, also <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/Y5rMr">visits</a> the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/mlp/chunk/35971518/500/5/#35979038">anniversary sticky</a>, answering questions, showing unused scripts, and bidding farewell with his favorite <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/mlp/chunk/35971518/500/6/#35979809">mantra.</a> The stickied thread becomes the largest thread in /mlp/'s history.</li>
<li>October 11 - A /b/ mod breaks GR15. The mod <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/FESi5">stickies a pony shitpost</a>, presumably in honor of FiM's 10th anniversary, and /b/ reacts with confusion, pony porn, and image macros unrelated to the thread. As the thread progresses, the OP gets <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/tpzXZ">updated</a> three times, referencing Lee Goldson, aka Barneyfag. After being unstickied, it finally falls off the board with <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://thebarchive.com/b/thread/837673649/">3197 posts</a>, making it the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/b/statistics/largest-threads/">4th largest thread</a> in /b/'s history.</li>
<li>October 12 - A minor controversy: /a/ reaches the 210M mark, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/a/thread/210000000/">210000000 is taken by a Higurashi thread</a> which gets immediately deleted and it's poster banned for 7 days for "roll threads outside /b/" while <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/a/thread/209999999/">the 209999999 is taken by an obvious haruhi GET thread that is allowed to stay up.</a> 210M was deleted too fast for desuarchive to archive it in time but other archives got it. The Higurashi poster's ban is later extended to 150 days and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/3540801/#3541578">proof is provided by in a /qa/ thread</a> by another anon who contacted him, sparking theories about haruhi favoritism and modGET faggotry.</li>
<li>October 15 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/vp/thread/45099200/#45099549">An autistic /vp/oreon shows his dead grandma his Shiny Dusknoir.</a> Needless to say, /vp/ fucking breaks. The shitstorm is so large that the thread reaches beyond 3000 posts without ever being stickied. It even reaches Twitter and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/showing-grandma-my-shiny-dusknoir">gets a KnowYourMeme entry.</a></li>
<li>October 16 - The 8th /v/ the musical ends at 152 songs. /pol/ debunks itself into oblivion with its new "debunked" meme, mocking how the media dismissed leaks from Hunter Biden's laptop as false.</li>
<li>October 17 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/283248827">Somebody on /pol/ discovers that they can literally modify Oregonian voter's votes through one of their websites,</a> just as long as you know their name and date of birth. If you don't understand, it means /pol/ is literally hacking the US election. They use the data on the website to track down big names and who they voted for. An anon summarises: <i>"Ok I just logged into the Washington state system for my ex wife, not only can i submit a ballot for her, but by even STARTING the process it cancels her other ballots. So if she orders a ballot, fills it out and sends it in THEN i start the online process even if I stop it and never file it CANCELS her ballot she thinks counts.

Ideas and thoughts are tossed around, including the possibility that Antifa may have used these records to dox Trump voters, or that Trump can use this as evidence that mail-in voting is easily rigged, or that people with administrative access can delete or change Trump voter's preferences. An anon from Uzbekistan (or using an Uzbek VPN) <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/283261966/#q283263661">makes a script that allows anons to cancel shitloads of votes.</a> The addresses of big names living in the vulnerable states are found, including those of Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos.

<li>October 18 - A mod <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arch.b4k.co/v/thread/529016056/#529019303">posts</a> in a /v/ thread about the Touhou character "Chen", and puts <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://youtu.be/roh0aiNoQR8">this video</a> on autoplay. As you can tell, the mods are gods. Meanwhile, [s4s] mods sticky an absolute fuckton of meme threads.</li>
<li>October 22 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/SBhTB">Self-serve advertisements are back</a>. Two days earlier, somebody noted <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/Floens/ChanTracking/commit/03a9db1de53d6d8a2ea0d213189902a499fc935e">that the page's</a> statistics have changed: 4chan is down to 500M impressions a month (from 703M), 20M unique visitors (down from 27.7M), and a bunch of new guidelines have been added, such as no gambling ads, no drug ads, no piracy ads, and no firearms ads.</li>
<li>October 23 - It takes one day for self-serve ads to BTFO a board. Somebody spends money on ads that directly link to /vp/ and say "I spent $60 on this ad instead of Sword and Shield to tell (You) that they are shit games and to not buy them". Tourists from all over 4channel flock to /vp/ to laugh at them. Dozens of other inflammatory ads go up, despite it supposedly being against the rules; these include a banner showing Pepe fucking janny in the mouth, barneyfag bait, and a soyjak banner on /a/. Many of the banners are archived <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/3565365">here</a>.</li>
<li>October 30 - /b/ gets a "reply or ur mum will do X" <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/K9jAc">sticky</a></li>
<li>October 31 - Skoopy CSS is added. /vp/ gets a LoL <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/N8OOE">sticky</a> unrelated to Halloween.</li>
<li>November 3 - /pol/ gets an election results <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/ZBj0X">sticky</a>. There's so much traffic 4chan gets repeated SSL errors, and /pol/'s sheer traffic surpasses that which it had during 2016's election day.</li>
<li>November 4 - Due to strange circumstances, it takes forever for the votes to get counted. Arizona goes blue, and soon Wisconsin and Michigan follow, putting Biden ever so close to victory. With less enthusiasm, /pol/ turns into a shitshow about election fraud, coping, OHNONONOs and the like. A bunch of crappy Pepe Joe Biden memes get posted (expect /pol/ to hijack it for their own gain). The rest of 4chan wonders if this will finally kill the election tourists off.</li>
<li>November 5 - The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/chunk/286876906/">election sticky</a> is unstickied. It has shattered the record for <a href="/The_longest_thread" title="The longest thread">the largest thread in history</a>, breaking the one hundred thousand reply barrier for the first time and ending with about 103,581 replies, shattering the SadPanda /h/ sticky by about thirty thousand posts.</li>
<li>November 7 -  After a ton of waiting, the Media declares Joe Biden to be the new President of the USA. /pol/ explodes again, this time in /leftypol/ or bunkerchan invaders, crossboarders and many more tourists all either making fun of /pol/, shitposting or having serious threads. This <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzDVaKRApcg">song</a> is put on autoplay with a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/288562771/#288562771">sticky that has a picture of Joe Biden</a>.</li>
<li>November 11 - 4chan randomly goes down for about fifty minutes. When posting finally works again, a message "〜 sorry 4 the downtime 〜" is added underneath the self-serve ads announcement.</li>
<li>November 12 - /trash/ gets a random <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/LILsQ">pokemon sticky</a></li>
<li>November 15 - Eventually the Biden thread is unstickied, perhaps due to the prolonged vote counting. /pol/'s activity remains extremely high as measured by 4stats.io, easily crushing the 2016 election's numbers both before and after election day. With the election results either strangely uncertain or perfectly sure depending on who you ask, the board has possibly become the most chaotic out of any in 4chan history. There's also <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/290686119/#290687462">Sneed and Jannieposting</a> in the wild.</li>
<li>November 16 - /f/ gets global ids. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/aG3jE">Blue name threads are made</a></li>
<li>November 20 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/5IPwM">/v/ votes Reimu Hakurei</a> as the annual (and unofficial) Queen of /v/, and a lot of seething over /jp/ ensues as a result.</li>
<li>November 22 - A mod gives an anon on /pol/ a twitter disclaimer for <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/292296472/#292298840">his post.</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/rAsFq">Archive.</a> A storyboard revisionist for Cartoon Network apparently starts <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/co/thread/119154788">shilling their #bettercartoon contribution on /co/</a> (no solid proof, but pretty suspicious). She tweets about finding the thread and claiming to be happy that it's not all negative feedback. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://warosu.org/ic/thread/5014402">Another Apple Mage thread</a> pops up on /ic/ as well, also probably shilled by the creator, who then magically appears in the thread and bitches about transphobic replies. An <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/zOzfj">anon on /f/ finds out the flash archive uses a flash emulator</a>; this gives a very pessimistic /f/ hope that their board won't die by the end of the year.</li>
<li>November 25 - Argentina's Lamb of God, Diego Maradona has passed away. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/d2LQI">/sp/ makes a sticky.</a> An [s4s] investigation reveals that a janny/mod known as nana_ <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/s4s/thread/9234113/">has been encouraging and possibly participating in the Enbie spam</a>. For no apparent reason, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/3648722">mods move the thread to /qa/</a>.

The mod also <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/s4s/thread/9231836">locks an OC thread</a> and remakes it, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/s4s/thread/9233249">this time with the enbie photoshopped in.</a></li>
<li>December 2 - Mods add fuel to the fire and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/LrROO">sticky</a> an Enbie thread on /qa/.</li>
<li>December 5 - /mu/ becomes the tenth board to join the one hundred million post club. Despite the K-Pop general's overconfidence, they <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archived.moe/mu/thread/99999999">miss</a> both <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/mu/thread/100000000">gets</a> and get laughed off the board.</li>
<li>December 7 - Barneyfag experiences the most epic BTFOing ever as a /qa/ anon pays the actual Barney voice actor to record a message directed at Lee, who obliviously mocks him for his incessant spamming, love of cheese, and Barney hatred. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/3683720">thread</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG7bkr_ygSQ">video</a></li>
<li>December 8 to January - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220110201111/https://arch.b4k.co/v/thread/535284186/#535286268">After a guy on /v/ suggests the idea,</a> /tv/ tries forcing the usage of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220110201817/https://iili.io/YQCtov.md.png">"keyed" and "locked"</a> as substitutes for based and cringe. It doesn't really catch on.</li>
<li>December 10 - Cyberpunk 2077 is finally released and /v/ is absolutely flooded with threads about the game. Hilarity ensues as the hype bubble bursts and the game is revealed to be a buggy piece of shit.</li>
<li>December 16 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archived.moe/biz/thread/24850475/hol-fukc-we-did-it">/biz/ gets a sticky</a> as Bitcoin finally breaks the 20000 USD/BTC barrier with a glorious pump at 1:42pm UTC.</li>
<li>December 17 - Pastebin decides to fuck itself and automatically privates any paste that the SMART filters identify as NSFW, in effect killing virtually all NSFW stories and plenty of SFW stories that writefags have uploaded to the site. /mlp/ and /trash/, both hyper-dependent on storing their works on Pastebin, freak the fuck out as at least half of their shit is obliterated. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/trash/thread/34819143/#34825193">Some anons</a> come to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/trash/thread/34819223/#34823721">the rescue</a> with a number of archive downloads to ease the pain. The Pastebin SMART filter is, as you'd expect, not smart at all and also privates a bunch of completely SFW pastes found in generals and stickies.</li>
<li>December 19 - Gabe Newell invades /b/ and ironically stickies <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/Dmzka">three</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/dJeUO">Half</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/0UzH8">Life</a> threads.</li>
<li>December 22 - The meido on /jp/ forgets to delete excess Hololive threads and they start to flood the board. Panic from everyone actually native to the board ensues.</li>
<li>December 24 - Dante beats Raiden in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/HbMte">finale of King of /v/ 2020</a> and becomes the unofficial King of /v/ for the year.</li>
<li>December 25 - Christmas hats are back, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/o3G4O">/b/ mods do some CSS fuckery</a>, but waste it on a bad meme. But /b/ forgives as the thread itself has a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/9GJvF">padoru hentai animation embedded</a>.</li>
<li>December 31 - /f/ gets a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/EyNhA">sticky</a> confirming that the board isn't going anywhere, and confirms that if the Ruffle emulator is a success, it'll be used as the standard flash file player on the board. MF DOOM is confirmed dead; /mu/ gets a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/XBE5k">sticky</a> and other boards like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/DVzFM">/co/ mourn too</a>.</li></ul>

<ul><li>January 1 - The nightmare of 2020 truly never ends. As December 31 ends, the date and time on each post doesn't read 1/1/21, but rolls over to 12/32/20. Whether this is mod fuckery, a glitch in the Matrix, or the beginnings of the Great Reset isn't entirely known yet, but 4chan freaks out anyway. However, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/f/thread/3453189/#3454457">this bug doesn't affect /f/</a>, the only board that wanted to stay in 2020.</li>
<li>January 2 - /biz/ freaks out as Bitcoin continues its monumental bullrun, blazing past 30000 USD/BTC and peaking at nearly 35000 USD/BTC. It turns out over $130 million dollars worth in BTC short positions got liquidated, so all the Boboposters start blowing their brains out. <i>(seriously though, when this bubble pops, it's gonna be fucking amazing to watch /biz/ implode)</i></li>
<li>January 3 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/299999445#p300000000">/pol/'s 300 millionth post</a> declares Christ the King.</li>
<li>January 4 - Trump apparently said a thing and Bitcoin crashes to below 28000 USD/BTC before rebounding slightly. The pink fields are not yet ready. Alexi Laiho dies at age 41; /mu/ gets a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/pDov8">sticky</a>, but many anons either call his music shit or complain mods "replaced the DOOM sticky", when in reality it was already removed a day prior.</li>
<li>January 6 - With the election to be certified, a shit ton of protesters storm the Capitol in D.C. /pol/ goes absolutely apeshit and gets a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/XG4PL">sticky</a>.</li>
<li>January 8 - A voice actor dies and tons of candle emojis are posted by other voice actors on Twitter, not revealing the name because the family wanted privacy. That, and a few dipshits giving away too many clues (male, married, the work of the people who tweeted), results in /co/ and /v/ positively ID'ing the guy in under two and a half hours, with a little help from two voice actresses basically getting duped into confirming who he was. A bit of backlash happens when /co/ and /v/ see the candles as nothing more than an ego boost against the family's wishes. Meanwhile, a number of conservative figures and sites are struck by big tech in the USA, making anons primarily on /pol/ fear that 4chan's days may be numbered.</li>
<li>January 10 - Bitcoin sinks from 39000 USD/BTC to 32000 USD/BTC over the course of eight hours, sending /biz/ into a pink frenzy.</li>
<li>January 12 - The day of the Adobe killswitch arrives; /f/ gets a sticky, but Merlin comes in at the last minute and gives everyone on the internet <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/rjdmR#selection-3219.0-3219.9">a solution to the flash problem</a>. Flash is saved!</li>
<li>January 16 - /g/ gets a new, unlocked, random <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/g/thread/79731833/hsssssssssss-3">sticky</a> for the first time in ages.</li>
<li>January 17 - 4chan goes down at about 4:26am local time. It returns roughly an hour later, but only passfags can post. The issue seems to resolve itself about ten minutes later.</li>
<li>January 23 - Larry King is pronounced dead; /tv/ gets a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/80yBy">sticky</a>.</li>
<li>January 26 - The /biz/ reddit colony called /r/wallstreetbets causes GameStop's stocks to go up into the billions and threads pop up on several boards including /v/, /pol/ and /biz/. Hedgefunds be damned on Friday.</li>
<li>January 27 - /r/wallstreetbets temporarily goes private due to the GameStop short squeeze and their Discord server is banned for "hate speech" (because somebody beat the filter). Redditors flood onto /biz/ and make the board the fastest on the whole site. Other stocks such as AMC, Express Inc., Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, iRobot, and Blockbuster get the GameStop treatment too. The subreddit is unprivated an hour later. /biz/ is finally fucking making it. At the same time, /v/ finds and raids a stream for the New Vegas mod "The Frontier" after memeing about the mod for a bit more than a week and exposing one of the devs as a pedo or some shit (it's quite confusing). Afterward, the mod creators pull the plug on the mod out of stress. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://i.imgur.com/rlvLm1v.png">This image sums things up decently.</a>[<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arch.b4k.co/v/search/subject/frontier%20meltdown/">b4k archive</a>], [<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DZKmEZFW9c">video</a>], [<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://youtu.be/waNTnRTXrH8">interview</a>]</li>
<li>January 27 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.fo/aevby">1M GET</a> on /t/ is reached</li>
<li>January 28 - /biz/'s GME stock trading take a hit when stock trading app Robinhood (and a few others) delist GME and AMC, only allowing people to close positions but not buy or sell. The Internet goes wild, uniting rightists like Donald Trump Jr. with leftists like AOC under one banner of "Fuck Robinhood and fuck market manipulation." GME closes the day losing nearly half its value, though it mostly recovers by the next day.</li>
<li>January 29 - <b>/vt/ - Virtual YouTubers</b> is added, finally freeing /jp/ from the endless cycle of VTuber cancer. The anime VTuber virgins do battle with the Annoying Orange OG VTuber chad's but the mods delete the Orange threads. /vt/ initially does not appear on any offsite archival websites, leading some to believe many early threads are lost to time. However, the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.nyafuu.org/vt/">Nyafuu</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://warosu.org/vt/">Warosu</a> archives began archiving a few days later, having archived mostly everything.</li>
<li>January 30 - PhilosophyTube, a popular leftist youtuber and one of /lgbt/'s favorite lolcows, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AITRzvm0Xtg&amp;ab_channel=PhilosophyTube">comes out as transgender</a> and the board is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/4C5El">flooded with threads about it.</a> Many posters feel like PT's coming out is illegitimate, partly because of /lgbt/'s meme/conspiracy theory that he raped contrapoints (another trans youtuber and /lgbt/ lolcow), which has now been <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archiveofsins.com/lgbt/thread/18841274">resparked.</a></li>
<li>January 31 - Hiro makes his first appearance in a year in a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.alice.al/vt/thread/132025/">/vt/ thread asking what happened to the 4chan VTuber.</a> He confirms that the project was cancelled, and that all of the new boards added recently have been the mods' idea and not his.</li>
<li>February 2 - Phoneposters are temporarily cucked as loading a blue board covers the entire page with an impossible-to-remove ad. The problem is fixed a few hours later.</li>
<li>February 2-3 - /tv/ had a long car chaseb owl thread series when some schizo in South LA leads the cops on a retarded 15mph freeway chase over the course of like five and a half hours. Police spikes stripped the leather off of two tires and eventually one of the rims blew out and ended the chase. A couple of drivers beside the vehicle livestreamed it all. After the rim got destroyed, the anons who wanted to see suicide by cop <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/tv/thread/146031031">were disappointed to see him bitch out and cooperate after ten minutes of standing still.</a> ReviewBrah himself even appeared in the YouTube stream chat. The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archiveofsins.com/lgbt/thread/18888888/">18888888 GET</a> on /lgbt/ is taken by (probably) a scriptfag and the mods lock the thread. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/A46M7">A GET thread on /b/</a> scores a huge amount of dubs, gets 2195 replies and gets stickied, similarly to the [s4s] sticky from April 3rd, 2017.</li>
<li>February 5 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/3881520">/qa/ gets a rare Developer post.</a> Anon Dev clarifies it was him, not Hiro, who posted the RIP Longcat sticky in /b/ on September the 20th. Christopher Plummer dies. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/tv/thread/146144533">/tv/ gets a sticky.</a></li>
<li>February 7 - /sp/ gets an annual <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/G6TKt">Super Bowl sticky.</a></li>
<li>February 9 - CD Project Red, the makers of Withcer and Cyberduck, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/sTSYZ">announce that their database has been hacked.</a> [<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arch.b4k.co/v/thread/543671841/">Anon post</a> the source code of Gwent on /v/ but digging reveals its an old build. Suspicions grow of the leak being a lie only for pity to make up for the Redditry disaster of Cyberdunk2077. It is suspected that the devs bought the game in the auction but it isn't confirmed yet.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://archive.is/fYD8T">[97]</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://archive.vn/j36JF">[98]</a></li>
<li>February 12 - After a week-long absence of New Board Friday, a new board, <b>/pw/ - Professional Wrestling</b> is created. /asp/ is suddenly locked, and at 12:37pm UTC, two moderator posts confirm that /asp/ is being closed as a board. This is the first mainstay board removal since the deletion of /rs/ in April 2014 (or /q/ in September 2013, whatever you want to believe constitutes a board). A new board for extreme sports is also confirmed "soon" and all non-wrestling content is temporarily sent to /out/. The last post in /asp/ history is a resounding, short, and sweet <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/asp/thread/12946854/#q12971596">"BASED."</a> And as if that wasn't enough, a Sneedposter who managed to enter a livestreamed Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card competition manages to make it all the way to the finals against Virtual Seto Kaiba. Though he couldn't take home the victory overall, the actual Seto Kaiba voice actor playing the virtual version says, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://clips.twitch.tv/GleamingMildPheasantJebaited-ACfykV4H-Og0eEnU">"I guess I'm going to have to...<b>CONSNEED</b> that match, but it doesn't mean you're any good!"</a>, which sends <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/vg/thread/324368749">/dlg/</a> into a frenzy.</li>
<li>February 17 - Rush Limbaugh died. A sticky is made on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/gXW2b">/pol/.</a></li>
<li>Feburary 18 - During the airing of the 20th episode of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou, Featherine Augustus Aurora appears and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/a/thread/216641078/">/a/ goes absolutely bananas.</a> /sci/ gets a sticky <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.vn/5Wm1v">for the Perserverance landing.</a> Crashing predictions are made.</li>
<li>February 19 - <b>/xs/ - Extreme Sports</b> is added, providing a home for it after the grand majority of /asp/'s threads were deleted the week prior. /asp/ is removed from the board list, though it can be accessed manually (still frozen). Meanwhile, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/6mEdd">/v/ gets a sticky 'bout BLIZZCON.</a></li>
<li>February 20 - Developers finally put /xs/ at the end of the board list after triggering everyone's OCD by leaving it between /sp/ and /tg/.</li>
<li>February 22 - Daft Punk split. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/HbB64">/mu/ gets a sticky.</a></li>
<li>February 25 - In the early morning (or late evening for burgers), a screenshot from the new 5th generation MLP movie gets published and /mlp/ promptly goes crazy. Later in the day, at 10AM EST, Hasbro holds their annual investor conference virtually, showcasing plans for brands and supercharging their blueprints, among which is MLP. More footage of new characters is shown and a male lead is confirmed, among other things. /mlp/ reaches over 500% of its usual activity and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/tBwTb">two</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/NLmWZ">threads</a> are pinned.</li>
<li>February 26 - Pokémon Legends Arceus and remakes for Diamond and Pearl are announced. /vp/ gets <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/DHu5z">two</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/FMO6X">stickies.</a> More importantly though, a thread with a picture of Monke Putin is stickied on /int/, stating that janitors can't delete stickies. Anons take it as an announcement that one of the notorious Russian janitors has been dismissed, and, coincidentally, janitor applications open for the next 72 hours.</li>
<li>February 27 - /v/ gets its annual <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/e5T0D">HARMONY</a> sticky. The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/Zdxhq">/v/GAs for 2020</a> are also held and stickied, during which W.T Snacks makes an appearance as a DJ and even posts on /v/.</li>
<li>February 28 - /mlp/'s mods (headed by Twimod) host a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/mlp/thread/36641353/">town hall sticky</a> to ask for improvements and ideas for the board going into the new MLP G5 series.</li>
<li>March 2 - The /mlp/ town hall concludes. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/mlp/thread/36656144/">Twimod officially announces new changes to /mlp/:</a> An increased character limit from 2000 to 3000 for writers, the dice roll feature used on /tg/ and /qst/, pony meme flags like the ones found on /pol/, and after a long time since the banner contest, the board is also getting a banner. Twimod also unbans Anonfilly threads on the condition that degenerate erotic roleplayers fuck off, while other threads such as diaper ponies and Milky Way threads remain banned on the grounds that they're based on fetish content. Equestria Girls content is also confirmed /mlp/. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/mlp/thread/36656404/">An /mlp/ banner suggestion thread is also stickied.</a></li>
<li>March 4 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/nvE6v">Someone on Futaba Channel</a> decided to post places where Hololive was discussed internationally. Discussion soon shifted to 4chan, as it was the opening image. This drew the attention of /vt/ and resulted in a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.alice.al/vt/thread/1191041/">thread that reached post limit</a> where Nameless and Anonymous people mingled.</li>
<li>March 7 - /a/ mods <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://desuarchive.org/a/thread/217766474">sticky and lock a reminder</a> to use spoiler tags in the wake of Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time's release.</li>
<li>March 8 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/PX5qv">/g/'s daily programming general</a> turns into the Rozen Maiden general, accompanied by an embedded Suiseiseki as well. Odd for a board concerned with Junk.</li>
<li>March 13 - One of the /c/ jannies (probably newly hired) monitoring the Nanachi thread deletes all the Nanachi aggie.io links and threatens to get anybody posting about aggie.io in the future banned. Apparently, you can't have a proper discussion over whether Nanachi is a minority-hating Nanazi. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/c/thread/3862748#p3871279">The janny loses his position and gets publicly banned.</a> It's possibly the first time a public ban has been handed out in /c/'s history. The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/aqeWU">Desutruction of /bant/</a> starts, and weeks of DESU spam follow. Other spammers, like Snyderposters, try to fight them and the Cirno threads hang on like usual.</li>
<li>March 14 - /mlp/'s Twimod <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/mlp/thread/36717832/">stickies a thread for selecting the new /mlp/ banner</a> from a shortlist of ten. Twimod confirms /mlp/ pixel flags will be implemented on the next weekend (it's just pony heads, not even flags). <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/trv/thread/1973636/">/trv/ also gets a sexy new locked sticky.</a></li>
<li>March 16 - The /mlp/ banner is selected: Twilight reading from a book titled "Butts." It goes into rotation the following day, triggering many who still get mad at cartoon horses after 11 years.</li>
<li>March 23 - The cargo ship "EverGreen" <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/AGpGo">gets stuck in the Suez Canal,</a> pausing international trade. General threads made in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/m9z0t">/pol/</a> later leading to tourists arriving and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/L1c0o">discussing</a> on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/mfoNp">/n/.</a> An open letter against Richard M. Stallman of GNU fame is brought forth, and /g/ doesn't like it. They <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/oTrok">create their own letter in support of him.</a> It eventually surpasses the original in signatures, and gets support from all over the world.</li>
<li>March 24 - The expansive archive of yuki.la mysteriously dies without a clue as to what happened to it.</li>
<li>March 27 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/LPySg">An anon from /g/</a> appears and declares to have scraped the text, URLs, and MD5 hashes from yuki.la in its entirety, rescuing mountains of posts that were briefly lost to time. No thumbnails or full res images appear to have been saved however, and it took till May 2nd for the anon to finish zipping (see that day).</li>
<li>April 1 - Jannies finally ask for assistance against the leaf menace. Flags are removed from all boards. A live tracker count of Canadians in added to each board. A rake icon appears next to each post, where users can report posters suspected of being Canadians. Caught leafs are sent to <b>/qb/ - Quebec</b> for the time being, as well as anons who make too many false reports. A number of word filters are also added: "Sorry" becomes "based", "tranny" becomes "hoser", "out" becomes "oot", "about" becomes "aboot", "house" becomes "igloo", and "football" becomes "hockey". The board quickly becomes a slower /b/ due to a lack of rules, with various /mlp/ users willingly raking themselves in order to post more pony. Around 1PM EST posting site-wide is disabled for an unknown reason and returns a connection error when attempted. The website returned around 2:30PM. Later, /qb/ gets the Canadian flag as its background and gets songs like "O Canada", "Something In Your Mouth" by Nickelback, "The Power Of Love" by Celine Dion, and "Sorry" by Justin Bieber autoplaying as well.</li>
<li>April 2 - /qb/ is frozen at 2:19am local time after 16289 posts and a shitload of ponies, leafs, and shitposting. The last post on the board was <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/N67VU">a screencap of a vore fetish green featuring Lyra from MLP.</a> A fitting end.</li>
<li>April 3 - Presumably, a mod makes <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHsBu-9uwtA">this</a> Yakuza song autoplay on a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/DEbXh">/b/ thread.</a> Faggot eceleb threads <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/gtzqT">take a vacation</a> to /qa/ as /v/'s favorite one, Vinny, is accused of sexual harassment. Merely by shitposting about it, they <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/ZfiDQ">receive the blame from Twitter</a> in an amazing display of intellectual disability.</li>
<li>April 4 - The final chapter of Attack on Titan is released and /a/ was very vocal about it and not happy. The catalog suffers a meltdown and /a/ briefly surpasses /pol/ in posting speed as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/VCXs7">the ending</a> brings disappointment to many.</li>
<li>April 9 - Around 1PM EST a new teaser for the new MLP movie drops, showcasing the last two main characters that were not seen in 3D yet. One of them looks like a carpet muncher and the other one is seen holding a smartphone. /mlp/ reaches 300% activity and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/C4pL4">a thread is stickied.</a></li>

There are eighty different icons to choose from, including main characters, side characters, board-centric characters like Anon and Anonfilly, Equestria Girls and Them's Fightin' Herds characters, the known G5 characters (at least those that were known when anons were creating the flags), and even the /mlp/ 4chan Cup logo. The reason it took so long is still uncertain, but likely due to the fact that the site's code itself had to be altered to accommodate them. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/jXLye">Self-fellating thread that mods stickied.</a> Also on the same day, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/ekaD1">/vm/ gets an "Official Vidya Night"</a> with Alien Swarm Reactive drop being played.</li>

We’ll change it back once you all learn how to be a board again."</a> said an anon who may or may not be a mod. Eventually, they get tired of deleting new threads, and /b/ resumes being literally nothing.</li>
<li>June 1 - /lgbt/ gets its <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/3dBI0">pride month sticky</a> (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archiveofsins.com/lgbt/thread/20824120">alternate archive</a>).</li>

<li>June 5-10 - Anons <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/wip/PcyNX">complete a parody of Goodbye Volcano High</a> called "snoot game" before the game is even released, just so they could <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arch.b4k.co/v/thread/558234035/#558254721">showcase it for /v/3.</a> The game quickly grows popular on /v/, and then the mods start deleting all threads about it. Someone <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/6UPq3">confronts them about this</a> on 4chan's IRC and receives unsatisfying answers. The board gets angry and snoot game threads devolve into mockery of jannies, and particularly of the moderator "I AM ABIB".</li>
<li>June 6 - /tv/ learns about Tariq Nasheed's (black Alex Jones) documentary "Buck Breaking", which claims that gay white slaveholders would rape black male slaves (this literally did not happen).

<li>June 17 - The oldest living thread (non-stickied) on 4chan, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.wakarimasen.moe/po/thread/535361">a Pepakura thread on /po/</a>, dies after 1990 days as a result of the soyjak.party faggots who spammed new threads and bumped existing ones to kill ancient /po/ threads. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/sp/thread/109567945">Flag icons for England, Scotland, and Wales get added to /sp/</a>, conveniently before England and Scotland are due to play each other in the Euro tournament.

<li>June 18 - The Euro match between England and Scotland is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/sp/thread/109621957">stickied on /sp/.</a> On a completely different note, the "He Will Not Divide Us" flag stolen from Greeneville 4 years earlier (see 2017 section) was <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210921193520/https://www.greenevillesun.com/news/local_news/he-will-not-divide-us-flag-recovered-returned-to-artist/article_9edcbf7b-8d8f-5366-96a5-789a8309cb34.html%7C">returned to Luke Turner</a>, one of the three artists (along with Nastja Säde Rönkkö and Shia Labeouf) of the anti-Trump exhibit of the same name.</li>
<li>June 25 - On /mlp/, new screenshots of the G5 movie emerge in book previews, and a thread about it gets <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/1zjQx">stickied.</a></li>
<li>June 26 - The RAID controller fails and 4chan becomes unavailable for a little over 4 hours. The night turns into morning by the time the problems are over.</li>
<li>June 27 - The RAID controller is power cycled according to the dev, who <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/YUWRk">shows up in /qa/'s Happening Thread.</a> He then has a very short Q&amp;A with the anon's in the thread, thankfully not alerting the entire site in the process.</li>
<li>June 28 - The /PNN/ - /pol/ News Network general, yellow pages-like general (featuring a podcast) meant to make the board "easier to use" is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/327808495/">moved to /qa/</a> for the first time due to being a meta thread. The userbase of this general was not used to boards outside /pol/, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/4598100/">when besieged by /qa/'s catalog of shitposters</a> they became hopelessly panicked. Several threads were made on /pol/ that tried to go back or raid /qa/, but the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/4602534/">users of /qa/ reported</a> them each time and pulled them back in to milk the lulz. The war rages on for a few days to a week as /PNN/ can do nothing and drowns in soyduels, leebait, tranny baiting, anime spam and falseflag trolling.</li>
<li>June 30 - Voice actors for the G5 movie are revealed and /mlp/ talks about it. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/mlp/thread/37193117">Another one.</a></li>
<li>July 2 - A mod stickies a thread mocking Pokémon fans on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/b/thread/858188290/">/b/</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arch.b4k.co/v/thread/562327114/#562327114">another thread</a> sarcastically claiming that the original Doom's source code was leaked on /v/.</li>
<li>July 5 - A new non-Jewgle captcha is implemented. A global message is made saying "New CAPTCHA testing thread is here." with a link to a /qa/ thread. Sliders cause low-IQ retards to froth, mobileniggers are utterly btfo, and anons go apeshit in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/soz86">/qa/ test thread,</a> which reportedly jumped above 1000% usual activity. Many usually fast boards such as /biz/ and /bant/ see their activity rates <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://i.imgur.com/syAXKrU.png">absolutely plummet,</a> which should give you an idea of the average poster there. Meanwhile, the audio software Audacity gets called "spyware" after recent data collection changes by the new owners, leading to a forking of the project on Github. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/g/thread/82402134">/g/ finds the naming poll</a> and pushes "Sneedacity" which leads to analblasting by GitTards and the fork's creator, who claims 4chan trolls are calling him IRL (100% a lie). Somebody else lies and claims "Sneed" is a slur meaning "Special Needs". While the original poll/fork is deleted, /g/ users make their own Sneedacity fork.</li>
<li>July 5-7 - According to 4stats data, posting activity on 4chan dropped by nine to thirteen percent following the addition of the new captcha. For specific boards at peak times immediately surrounding the new Captcha's addition, /a/ dropped by 30%, /b/ dropped by 11%, /co/ dropped by 24%, /fit/ dropped by 28%, /int/ dropped by 28%, /mu/ dropped by 19%, /pol/ dropped by 2.5%, /r9k/ dropped by 31%, /tv/ dropped by 21%, /v/ dropped by 13%, /vg/ dropped by 11%. Some boards, like /biz/, /g/, /sp/, /tg/, /trash/, and /x/, increase in activity for various reasons (Sneedacity, Euros, etcetera).</li>
<li>July 7 - An anon on /v/ <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arch.b4k.co/v/thread/562986690/">makes a thread</a> showing off his drawing of his donut steel Starfy OC: a star with boxing gloves. Anons immediately fall in love with the character and create a mountain of fanart (including porn) of him, as well as a female version. Anons ultimately decide to name him Starfist the Fistar. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.md/Zp3hc">Alternate archive.</a></li>
<li>July 11 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/sp/chunk/110843819/">/sp/ gets a sticky for the Euro 2020 final between England and Italy.</a> Celebrations of "it's coming home" turn to "it's coming Rome" as England does what it does best and chokes in the penalty shootout (coincidentally, they're managed by the guy who choked his penalty at Euro 1996). The sticky becomes the largest thread in /sp/ history, beating out Super Bowl LII. /sp/ peaks at 600 posts per minute post-game and the board ends up with 115000 posts in a day, easily outdoing every day of the 2018 World Cup. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/sp/thread/110878290/#110879128">England says the line.</a> The England mockery on the board is further increased over how all three black players missed their penalties, after the English team kneeled for diversity and anti-racism prior to every game, and /sp/ basks in the Twitter and YouTube cope.</li>
<li>July 13 - England, Wales, and Scotland flags are removed now that the Euros are over. All bongs now post under the Union Jack once more.</li>
<li>July 27 - Joey Jordison passes away suddenly. /mu/ gets <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/tCCaS">a sticky.</a></li>
<li>July 28 - Just a day later, Dusty Hill also passes, with <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/zpnjo">another sticky</a> on /mu/.</li>
<li>July 30 - The Chris-chan Saga is almost certainly over: A leaked chat and phone call in which Chris-chan literally admits that he is fucking his 80 year old mentally-deficient mother makes the rounds. The shitstorm begins a-brewing on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/64764372">/r9k/</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/332124544">/pol/</a>. "CHRIS CHAN DID WHAT" trends on Twitter. Kiwi Farms struggles to handle the influx of users. Greene County police is contacted and within a few hours of the leak, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://kiwifarms.net/threads/chris-chan-incest-leak-chris-has-been-removed-from-14-branchland-court.96559/">Chris is removed from his base of operations (and probably put in a cell) and his mother is taken to a hospital to be assessed.</a> Mother/son incest in Virginia is a Class 5 Felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison if Chris-chan is convicted of the felony, or up to 12 months if convicted of the misdemeanor (and that's not accounting for likely rape and senior abuse charges). Following his removal, Chris-chan attempts to stay with extended family, but instead gets the boot and has to sleep at a hotel. Joshua Moon, the Kiwi Farms op and Chris-chan simp who'd set up a GoFundMe  to help Chris get to the Everfree Northwest convention, learns that they've just banned him and announces that he is refunding the donors.</li>
<li>July 31 - The saga gets more retarded. Joshua Moon discovers that Chris-chan <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://kiwifarms.net/threads/chris-chan-incest-leak-chris-has-been-removed-from-14-branchland-court.96559/page-407#post-9580110">has stolen $750 out of his mother's bank account</a>, violating the emergency protective order he'd just been put under. He calls the cops on him and finally declares that he's done helping Chris-chan. He also releases private chat logs from a month prior in which Chris-chan talked about his new girlfriend.</li>
<li>August 1 - The cops finally descend on Chris-chan at the Regency Inn in Richmond, Virginia. Chris-chan is arrested and the arrest is streamed for the world to see. The Henrico County Sheriff's Office shows that he is officially being charged with incest. The snoot game sticky on /trash/ is finally unstickied after 67129 posts, making it the 4th largest thread in the history of 4chan.</li>
<li>August 2 - A /b/tard jacks <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/b/thread/860223907">Chris-chan's "SONICHU" vanity plate.</a> Pleas to cum on it are sadly not met.</li>

<li>August 7 - A deranged Aussie shitposter <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/JZp3N">dumps his screencaps on /qa/</a> after slowly making one new Hololive thread on /jp/ each day to piss everyone off. Eventually they flood the catalog and the Meido shows too little intellect to delete the faux on-topic threads. /jp/ is ruined!</li>
<li>August 8 - Isabella Loretta Janke, the person Chris was talking to when he admitted to fucking his mother, is exposed. She is revealed to have boiled a hamster alive, driven a transgender student to suicide <i>(keyed)</i>, and lied to prevent the recording from being disclosed, among many other horrifying acts. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://encyclopediadramatica.online/Isabella_Loretta_Janke">She almost makes Chris look like a goody two shoes.</a></li>
<li>August 12 - The trailer for the upcoming G5 movie "My Little Pony: A New Generation" is released, and /mlp/ gets a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/JblGS">sticky.</a> The reaction to the trailer is a resounding "meh", much to the dismay of doominggers and hopefags alike, although a book detailing the movie's whole plot was leaked a week early just a few hours later.</li>
<li>August 13 - A Britbong /trv/eler named Miles Routledge <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/trv/thread/2075339">posts from Kabul, Afghanistan</a> as the country is caught up in the Taliban resurgence. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/trv/thread/2076699">Miles continues</a> posting <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://archive.4plebs.org/trv/thread/2078614">subsequent threads</a> that become the most popular in /trv/ history. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/UjRgG">Routledge gets recognition in the media over his Facebook updates.</a> With flights out of Kabul stopped, <a href="/Lord_Miles" title="Lord Miles">Lord Miles</a> is trapped.</li>
<li>August 14 - The Friday Night Funkin' vs. /v/ mod gets canned after the alternate ending to "/v/ goes to the cinemas" is found in the files. Twittertards apparently think they've downloaded CP. The mod remains downloadable through MEGA links. Later, the original creator of the comic draws an official response to the drama which ends just like the alternate ending to the infamous comic.</li>
<li>August 15 - The tenth anniversary 4chan World Cup ends with /s4s/ going on an insane run to beat /b/ 3-1 in the final. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/s4s/thread/9843882">The board gets a sticky with Hip To Be Square embedded.</a></li>

<li>September 1 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/4970397/">'Jak historians on /qa/ discover bombshell evidence</a> that the original soyjak, previously believed to have been posted by a swede on December 30th, 2017 possibly wasn't truly the first, putting the "swedish win" theory in jeopardy. While the swede's soyjak is the one that became ubiquitous, another very different looking soyboy edit of wojak was posted more than a month before on /v/. Swedish detractors argued that it doesn't count as a soyjak, sparking philosophical debate as to what truly makes a 'jak and causing anti-sweden sentiments on /qa/ to grow.</li>
<li>September 9 - It's Cirno day! The mods sticky a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/JU5JD">Cirno thread</a> on /bant/. The song Chirumiru is also reportedly played on [s4s]'s catalog.</li>

<li>September 12 - A complete and utter newfag <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arch.b4k.co/v/thread/570613502/">makes a /v/ thread</a> asking to know more about /v/-tan and Cancer Lord, as FNF Vs. /v/ has become surprisingly popular amongst normalfags. Anons humor him and mock his newfaghood. Suddenly, a link to his Discord server appears, and anons discover from it that OP is a gay black underaged furry who engages in fake ERP. OP tries to damage control, but it's far too late as anons have a field day shitting on him for 700 posts. Thus ends one of the lulziest threads of all time.</li>
<li>September 16 - Clive Sinclair, creator of the ZX Spectrum dies at age 81. /vr/ gets a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://warosu.org/vr/thread/8144197">sticky.</a></li>

<li>October 12 - Two days after the 11th anniversary of FiM's premiere and 2 days after being admitted to a hospital, the CEO of Hasbro, Brian Goldberg, dies. The coincidence makes Anons wonder whether Chris Chan's prophecy of Hasbro suffering drastic consequences for not making more seasons of FiM instead of G5 came true.</li>
<li>October 21 - Alec Baldwin accidentally shoots two people on a movie set, killing one. Anon on /tv/ <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/tv/thread/158000521/">leaks the story</a>.</li>

'Jakkers and /qa/nons alike fear /qa/ is in danger now that Operation Clean Stable is in full swing.</li>
<li>November 4-5 - /qa/ is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.md/5GnHN">reduced to the 4chan Happenings, Not A Happening, and the sticky threads.</a> Posting is still disabled and users begin flocking to other boards as well as <a href="/Soyjak.party" title="Soyjak.party">soyjak.party</a>. Rumors are circulating that a /qa/ discord server orchestrated the /lgbt/ raid (while the existence of the server was proven, it has since changed its name and many posts from the days of this event were deleted, most of which were not screencapped. This makes it difficult to tell who was "truly" behind the raid- /qa/, <a href="/Soyjak.party" title="Soyjak.party">soyjak.party</a> or the discord server. It's all very confusing).  A meta thread is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/5368011/">moved from /a/ to /qa/,</a> then subsequently deleted. Meanwhile, /qa/ refugees, driven by the party and the discord server, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/GnVGS">culturally enrich /bant/</a> with 'jaks and try to make it their new home on 4chan, causing the board to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/Pe1XZ">spike in activity.</a> The mods start deleting all soyjak threads and banning anyone who posts them for "cross-board raiding". A few links to the discord server are given out on /bant/ and the situation gets more chaotic as /bant/ natives and /qa/ refugees continue to wrestle for control over the board. For some reason, a few /vt/fags decide to join in on the fun and help fight back the invaders by spamming gawr gura. Eventually things calmed down but /bant/ retained a higher level of activity than it had before, and while many /qa/ refugees left for soyjak.party, some of them stayed and continued to post /qa/ memes on /bant/. This shitstorm is known as the great /qa/-/bant/ merge.</li>

<li>May 14 - Payton Gendron shoots up a supermarket in Buffalo, citing 4chan and /pol/ in his manifesto as his reasoning for the shooting. The media goes apeshit over this, and so does /pol/. /pol/ and other boards go into panic mode as the shooter  explicitly listed every gun and website he used (writing he began using 4chan in 2020 as an underage b&amp;), leading to another scare of 4chan getting shut down, such as what happened to 8chan after the El Paso/Christchurch shootings. The shooting was livestreamed on Twitch, leading /pol/ on a wild goose chase as "a fucking leaf" (Canadian namefag who apparently recorded the stream) leads them on with several screenshots before the video was finally posted several hours later.</li>

<li>March 21 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.md/j1p7M">The /fit/ sticky</a> is updated with new links.</li>
<li>April 1 - The big April Fool's joke is...tagging one in 25 posts posts with "Powered by 4chan-GPT ●⏶●" and changing the anon's name to a random person's name (literally the same gimmick as the 2016 April Fools Day event). Anons lament the laziness of the mods who did nothing but take some old code and added one extra line to pretend it's fresh. Many anons instead prefer to wax nostalgic over the 2018 prank, leading to a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/VvpjU">nearly 700-reply /v/ thread complete with candy princess CSS.</a></li>
<li>April 2 - The 180M /int/ GET is a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/int/thread/179999731/#180000000">Brazillian win</a>, despite <a href="/Soyjak.party" title="Soyjak.party">the Sharty</a> desperately trying to claim the GET for themselves.</li>
<li>May 2 - The word "<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/g/search/text/nakadashi/">nakadashi</a>" is now spam filtered on /g/, because coomers would post it in response to every picture of an anime grill. Some claim to have been banned for posting it but that's probably because they were spamming/replying to off-topic bait.</li>
<li>May 13 - After a month and a half of nothing happening, <a href="/Soyjak.party" title="Soyjak.party">the Sharty</a> decides to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://sp.logwarehouse.net/read.cgi/soy/3176608">launch a raid</a> on /b/ at 8:00PM EST, with the intention of a complete catalog wipe. It got so bad that the board actually was unusable for a while.</li>
<li>May 14 - Thinking that pissing in an ocean of piss would work better the second time, <a href="/Soyjak.party" title="Soyjak.party">the Sharty</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://sp.logwarehouse.net/read.cgi/soy/3185678">organized their second raid</a> slightly better and started at 6:00PM, and managed to get 3 paged wiped. Mods would decide to take action, wiping out two pages while doling out 3-days for spamming/flooding. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://sp.logwarehouse.net/src/1960993.png">/b/'s 'log around 7:30PM</a></li>
<li>May 15 - Give it up for <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://sp.logwarehouse.net/read.cgi/soy/3195657">day three</a>. Today's raid started at 3:00PM and ended by 3:15, due to a lack of manpower because most <a href="/Soyjak.party" title="Soyjak.party">soyteens</a> are actual children who had to go to school. Also, 4chan &amp; the Good Smile company are <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/7edZV">filed against in a lawsuit</a> filed by the families of victims of the May 14, 2022 Buffalo massacre.</li>
<li>May 16 - /lgbt/'s <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archiveofsins.com/lgbt/thread/30997425/#31000000">31M GET</a> is a FAILGET, and but at least <a href="/Soyjak.party" title="Soyjak.party">the Sharty</a> failed to secure it this time.</li>
<li>May 17 - /biz/'s <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://warosu.org/biz/thread/S54995340#p55000000">55M GET</a> is barely better, and <a href="/Soyjak.party" title="Soyjak.party">the Sharty</a> has once again failed to steal it. They did, however, steal the /gd/ <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/gd/thread/444444/">444444 GET</a>. For some reason that 'teen was using a Pass while raiding, and when he tried to appeal his 5-day ban it was <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/bant/thread/17692750/">bumped to a perma.</a></li>
<li>May 18 - Cirno gets /tg/'s <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88888641/#88888888">88888888 GET</a>, with a mostly negative reaction.</li>
<li>May 21 - Cirno gets <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/427764003/#427777777">Seven 7s in a row</a> on /pol/, leading to much seething.</li>
<li>May 23 - The shark gets /vt/'s <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.palanq.win/vt/thread/50000000">50M GET</a> leading to a thread of bitching about script-use and bots and even <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.palanq.win/vt/thread/50000000/#50000974">accusations</a> of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.palanq.win/vt/thread/49997510/#50000550">DDOS</a>. /adv/'s <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/adv/thread/28999894/#29000000">29M GET</a> is generic but good advice.</li>
<li>May 24 - An Anon posting his nasty-ass room on /v/ gets told to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arch.b4k.co/v/thread/638139008">clean it up</a> by the mods.</li>
<li>May 26 - On /ic/ a wizard gets <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://warosu.org/ic/thread/6647131#p6666666">Satanic Septs</a>. /a/'s <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/a/thread/252996432/#253000000">253M GET</a> is a fail, and the runner-up is a thread made by a pedo about how much he likes young girls.</li>
<li>May 28 - After an "intense" battle in /b/'s catalog between the natives (logposters and pornbots) and <a href="/Soyjak.party" title="Soyjak.party">soyteens</a>, /b/'s <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://thebarchive.com/b/thread/899998971/#900000000">900M GET</a> is a black and white photo of American basketball player Derrick White. Cirno was the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://thebarchive.com/b/thread/899993096/#899999999">runner up</a>. This is the last major GET on /b/ until the 1 billionth post, which will happen in 4-5 years.</li>
<li>June 1 - /lgbt/ gets a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archiveofsins.com/lgbt/thread/31230716/#31230716">sticky</a> and <a href="/Flags#/lgbt/_Pride_Month_Flags" class="mw-redirect" title="Flags">selectable pride flags</a> for pride month.</li>
<li>June 2 - For the past couple days, /pmg/ on /biz/ was mysteriously being autosaged. Accusations that the jannies were kikes or being paid off by kikes to suppress gold and silver began to fly, before a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/YWWiS#p55159337">mod finally stepped in</a> and informed them that a pastebin link in the OP was the culprit. It contained the word cunny, which will automatically permasage a thread on any board if it's in the OP.</li>
<li>June 5 - The /t/ <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archiveofsins.com/t/thread/1108580/#1234567">1234567 GET</a> is something saying thanks. <a href="/Soyjak.party" title="Soyjak.party">The sharty</a> tried to steal it but somehow failed despite /t/ being one of the slowest boards. The /tv/ <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/tv/thread/185999317/#186000000">186M GET</a> is an Anon who doesn't need guns because he has a big dick. Also, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/BVAE0">Wired released an article</a> that contains some new info on Team 4chan. Turns out some of the top mods do not, in fact, do it for free. (The article was written by someone who thinks that 4chan has user accounts, and that janitors and moderators are the same thing, so take it with a grain of salt)</li>
<li>June 6 - It's <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archived.moe/bant/thread/17777777">Tea Tuesday</a> on /bant/.</li>

The runner-up is a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://desuarchive.org/mlp/thread/39999999/">Shimmerbro</a>. <a href="/Soyjak.party" title="Soyjak.party">The Sharty</a> planned to steal the GET hours in advance, but they failed miserably, not even getting the off-by-ones.</li>
<li>June 9 - /v/'s <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arch.b4k.co/v/thread/639989669/#640000000">640M GET</a> is stolen by Cirno mocking frogposters. It was deleted a few minutes later.

Both of the off-by-ones are advocating for Total Zigger Death.</li>
<li>June 11 - <a href="/Soyjak.party" title="Soyjak.party">Soyteens</a> steal /x/'s <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/x/thread/35000000/">35M GET</a>.

<li>June 22 - Mods send a thread about the missing submarine <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/iUoke">underwater</a>, complete with the Goblin Slayer OST. They do the same to a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/ztkuw">stickied thread</a> that was posted around the time the sub's oxygen was estimated to run out, this time with My Heart Will Go On. The sticky was originally rolling, but it was set to a normal sticky so the mod's embed post wouldn't be pruned. Around 3:25PM after it was announced that the sub had imploded it was changed back to a rolling sticky, causing ~4600 posts to be instantly pruned, including the embed. At 10:38PM a mod re-posted the embeds, and unstickied the thread. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/pZTR4">Thread after archiving</a></li>
<li>June 23 - Mod makes an <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/YUDt4">Essex thread</a> and Anonymous <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/YUDt4#p641700804">finally loses his virginity</a>.</li>

The wording on the signin page (A verified email address is required to post on <i>some boards</i> like /biz/) implies that this may become a requirement on other boards.

The image was hosted from a /vip/ thread that got purged on August 25, causing her to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://i.warosu.org/data/jp/img/0472/52/1725648747364177.png">disappear</a> if it wasn't cached by the browser.

<li>August 5 - Ongoing escalation of conflicts in the Middle East coupled with fears of US recession as the FED promised rate cuts, Japan raising rates and poor earnings report for the tech sector which fueled the rally destroyed Crypto. Many /biz/raelis killed themselves as they lost it all when Alts nosedived. Bitcoin dropped $20,000 in value in a span of a week as the ongoing sell off picks up speed. Many bulls were liquidated or had their life-savings obliterated. The pink fields return.</li>
<li>August 9 - Without prior notice, the mods at FANDOM shut down <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://warosu.org/lit/thread/23675760">the /lit/ wiki</a> and announced that the site would no longer host any content related to 4chan.

<li>August 15 - Not an April Fools joke, 12 years after it's release, Katawa Shoujo is now on Steam. Some threads are made on /v/, some having nostalgia for the game, others worrying about normalfags, and many wondering how the hell is /ksg/ still a thing.</li>

<li>August 25 - At about 10:30pm EST, 4chan has sporadic unresponsive periods. Half an hour later, 20 boards have their catalogs completely wiped. The affected boards were /a/, /b/, /c/, /d/, /h/, /vip/, /cm/, /3/, /aco/, /an/, /bant/, /biz/, /ck/, /co/, /diy/, /fit/, /int/, /lit/, /mlp/ and /trash/.

We're sorry.". On /co/, one mod chalks up the purge to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.is/pVgOI#p145129786">"mods being dumb."</a> Nothing is confirmed about why the purge happened yet. Random rumors from an exposed glowie to a credible threat to being related to the Telegram arrest are floated around.</li>
<li>September 6 - The Prismriver Sisters appears at the bottom of a /jp/ thread, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://okuu.pages.dev/threads/jp/47474046">this is how it appears</a>; <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://warosu.org/jp/thread/47474046">archive link</a>.

<li>September 23 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/9XcBR">The /g/ sticky</a> is updated with a new wiki link after the Fandom wiki was nuked.</li>
<li>October 1 - 4chan celebrates its <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/PStnN">21st birthday</a>. Party hats on all boards as usual, but also two birthday presents. The first present, for some fucking reason, is permastickies for <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/AH8Tl">/vrpg/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/DHD7N">/vmg/</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/xpUAx">/vst/</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/UytzC">/vm/</a>. The second and more widely-NOOTICED present is a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/483400670">surprise site-wide word filter</a>. Users can no longer type nigger, faggot, and/or tranny more than 3 times in a single non-spam post. This filter tracks the words cumulatively and it does not matter if the words are posted one after another, so posting niggerfaggot twice in a row, or posting a regular post with nigger/faggot/tranny spread throughout, will give a "Post successful!" message, but the post will not actually show up. Both regular users and shitposters were expectedly not happy, and due to the user backlash and lack of effectiveness, the mods would quietly remove the filter in the new few days after.</li>
<li>October 7 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/LXjCa">The /lit/ sticky</a> is reposted with updated wikis and links after the Fandom wiki was nuked.</li>
<li>October 10 - <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.md/Zn9vU">Three new rules to post</a></b> are introduced to /vg/ to prevent spam. The email verification system previously used on /biz/ is brought back as one option, the second option is to buy a pass, the third option for a "new user of 4chan" is to wait 15 minutes only once before posting. You only have to do one of the three options and accept 4chan cookies to be able to post, but <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/497792560">shitposters are pissed</a> because the rules inconvenience ban-evading, apply best to spambots, and does not stop bots or organic users on /vg/ from using a throwaway email account to post schizophrenic shit, Discord tags and ritualposts when the thread doesn't have fresh content and poster turnover.</li>
<li>October 18 - The new anti-spam rules spread to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.md/WUjbE">/pol/</a>, then to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.md/MayiS">/v/</a> the following day, and lastly to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/b0quG">/a/</a> on October 21. The sticky announcing the new rules on /pol/ forced the SLOW THE FUCK DOWN sticky to be purged and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/gt8hh">reposted as a reply in the /pol/ sticky</a>.</li>
<li>October 23 - The anti-spam rules are applied to all remaining boards, except of course /f/, which still uses the Google CAPTCHA, and the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.md/YUM0L">FAQ</a> is updated to include them.</li>
<li>October 27 - The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/500000000/">/vg/ 500M GET</a> is a Touhou General OP.</li>
<li>October 29 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/o86tq">A sticky on /mu/</a> is created to discuss alternatives for hosting the /mu/ wiki after it was nuked by Fandom, but is instead derailed by discussion about /mu/ being dead for the past few years and barely any suggestions for what alternatives to use, because mods only bothered to make this thread two months after /mu/ stopped caring about the wiki dying. Eventually the admin of the Fandom wiki posts in the thread with a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://4chanmusic.miraheze.org/wiki/4chanmusic_Wiki">Miraheze clone</a> of it, and the old sticky is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/MVHva">replaced with a new one</a> three days later.</li>
<li>October 31 - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.md/qH6Ij">/v/ got a Halloween sticky</a> themed around the Pumpkin Hill stage from Sonic Adventure 2. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW0sBxBAi_8">A fan remix</a> of the stage music played in the background, and every time the thread was refreshed it would <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPztK5sV9d8">ask you guys if you were going trick or treating</a>. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/s2g7B">/trash/ got a sticky</a> for the Halloween Google Doodle "Magic Cat Academy 3" and remained stickied for 12 days.</li>
<li>November 4 - /biz/ is battered and bruised as alt dominance declines day by day and money exits. The calm before the storm as polling day hits, depending on the result, one of either the bears or the bull will be completely destroyed. /pol/ meanwhile has been completely overrun with slide threads proclaiming Trump to be a Jewish agent and Kamala being the bringer of hope and joy. Much seething from the loser and gloating from the winner is coming.</li>
<li>November 5 - /pol/ and /biz/ celebrate the results of the presidential election as Trump wins the presidency. $218 billion American dollars enter the Cyrpto Market during the lead-up to 270 electors. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.ph/dqRdW">/pol/ gets a sticky</a>.</li>
<li>November 7 - /gif/ is reduced from 10 to 5 pages and the archive is removed.</li>
<li>November 19 - mp4 support is added to all boards, but has the same restrictions as webm files when posted outside of /gif/ and /wsg/.</li>
<li>December 2 - The /v/ catalog is swarmed with threads that all have a recolor of the ninja characters from Mortal Kombat with the text "ITT post them [color] characters".</li>
<li>December 5 - Bitcoin hits 100,000 USD per. /biz/ rejoices. It snaps back down to 90k 14 hours later, liquidating everyone.</li></ul>
