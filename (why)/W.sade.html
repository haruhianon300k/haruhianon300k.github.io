<p>As ron maimon correctly explains:</p>

<ul>
	<p>While atheists don't normally hear a personified God, they can be induced to by reading the Marquis de Sade. I can speak from personal experience here--- after reading the 120 Days of Sodom, I could swear that God came down from heaven to talk to atheist me. I guarantee you this type of experience from reading this book cover to cover, taking the villains' arguments seriously. The book is designed to induce a religious experience in an atheist. So being an atheist does not innoculate you from hearing God, in fact, all it usually does is make you more susceptible to ethical backsliding by rationalizations coming from immoral people who want to institute an ethics of convenience which gives them power over others.</p>
