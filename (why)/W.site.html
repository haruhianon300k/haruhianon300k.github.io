	<p>This site is for my own personal use.</p>
	<p>Usually, if I'm going to read a lengthy article, forum post, or book, I'll first translate the text-content into a bare-bones HTML docment for readability.</p>
	<p>Whenever I find fascinating stuff on the internet, I translate it into an .HTML document and put it here.</p>
	<p>Most of what I've put here so far was written by Ron Maimon, a brilliant author.</p>
