                It's incredible how you right wingers just invent bullcrap to follow the political wind. Employers do not 'cut back hours' in response to wage hikes, they pay the wages. If there is outsourcing, you need to slap a heavy tax penalty on it equal to the difference in average wages across the two countries.</p>

                <p>The rant you give about immigration, tying it somehow to this discussion, is hilarious. I can see I am talking to a paid human robot.

                In macroeconomics, the reason for unemployment is made up nonsense. It has nothing to do with 'sticky wages', it's because the employee wages have no relation to the supply/demand price which is the price at zero unemployment.</p>

                <p>The actual reason you get rising unemployment and demand slumps is that the money is being sucked out of the economy and into profits, because workers have no leverage to demand more.</p>

                <p>The reason Keynes doesn't say this, but invents nonsense about sticky wages is because this observation is due to Marx in 1965, in Capital Vol I. Keynes was trying to take Marx's prescription for more government oversight without agreeing with Marx's explanation for the unemployment/demand slump.</p>

                <p>The startling predictions of Keynesian economics are not what you say. The most startling prediction is that increasing minimum wage leads unemployment to drop. This is not emphasized in Keynesian courses, precisely because it shows that it's not 'sticky wages' that cause the problem in the first place--- INCREASING wages gets you out of the demand slump, not DECREASING them.</p>

                <p>When you force an increase of wages, the Keynesian effect means that unemployment at first goes down. If you then keep raising minimum wage, at some point, inflation begins. Then, if you keep raising it, inflation follows in lockstep. At no point does unemployment increase.</p>

                <p>This is an extremely surprising prediction, verified to be true all over the world since the 1930s. It both justifies macroeconomics as a field, and disproves the 'stick wage' hypothesis at the same time. The reason for demand-slump is too-low wages, as explained by Marx, not too-high wages, as theorized incorrectly by Keynes.

                The only problem I have with this essay is the claim that the "adoring gaze of the nymph" is imagined. Women are prey to sexism just as badly as men are, even more so, because they think they are immune, and will fawn adoringly over men that are socially vested with the impremature of genius, and this can be used to exploit a certain number sexually by any male figure of authority. The antidote to this is of course to separate sexual attraction from authority in formal settings like university, but it is important to recognize that the role of (imagined) social authority will still be all-important in informal settings, such as bars and cafes.

                The US gives arms subsidies to Israel, to the tune of 4 billion a year, which are then used to BUY AMERICAN WEAPONS. It's a subsidy to American weapons manufacturers. It's also pointless and stupid, and Bernie wants to use it as leverage. But it is NOT REPARATIONS and has nothing to do with holocaust reparations paid by GERMANY (not by the US) to survivors of slave labor camps.

                No, in 2028 the arctic will be ice-free, most of the coral will be dead, the ocean plankton will be reduced by 80%, and fish stocks will collapse. We’ll still have farming, but there will be famines here and there. It’s just
                that we won’t be able to do anything to avert the catastrophe in 2050, and the worse catastrophe in 2080, and the calamity in 2100, and the apocalypse in 2200. That’s why you need to act early.

                Marxism was purged from the US educational system in the 70s and 80s. The purge was complete in the 90s. There is no more Marxism in schools and media. AOC isn’t pushing government takeover of the economy, she is pushing a
                green new deal. It’s not the same thing.

                I am not politically pandering. I am 45, and I have a child, and I understand the climate very well, as I am a physicist by my professional training. The climate is driven by one parameter, CO2, and we just passed a serious
                threshhold, and we can’t pass any more without irrevesible terrible damage. I can tell you are not a college professor in a science, or in mathematics, or in climate, or in anything else techical, or else you would be saying
                the same thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                AOC isn’t experienced, nor is she the most well-studied. She makes a grammar error once in a while, she sometimes uses a word out of context. But, to complement this, she has a SENSE OF URGENCY regarding our problems, an EAR
                to the ground, hearing her constituents, and and an INSTINCT for putting together the right coalition to pressure for change. That’s far more important. The rest, she will learn quickly. Her vision, that can’t be taught, and
                it is easy to lose through the blindness that comes with holding political office too long.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this case, it is a coalition between those who want a jobs program to help poor Americans who can’t find a job, and those who want to avert catastrophe. This is a good political call, it is an act of vision. it should be
                supported, even by Republicans, because it is an act of vision
            </p>
            <p>
                In this time, we need all the people to join together, and not call each other names. I don’t really care what you are, just help avert climate catastrophe, and help get this jobs program passed. It will help the economy,
                really. Like the first new deal did.

                The way to “take it up” is to discuss it seriously, propose amendments, think about it, not mock it and reject it out of hand. There is language in there that is no good, and must be fixed, there are proposals that are too
                broad. It needs to be fixed and passed, and quickly, because we don’t have time to wait. Grow up,please, we don’t get two chances to save our future, we’ve already screwed up the first chance, in 1989, don’t throw away this
                one. Each chance you throw away makes the problem infinitely and qualitatively worse.

                Okay, then, go through the procedures to turn it into actual legislation, by holding a hearing in a committee, by getting input from the senators, including McConnell. They must take this seriously, it’s not a joke. This is
                the kind of thing that is needed to reconfigure US industry for the threat of warming.

                In 12 years, you don’t get another chance to avert the release of methane from the arctic, and the death of coral. That’s what the 12 years means, and that’s what she said. And it wasn’t AOC who said that first, the

            <p>
                If you wait too long, more than a decade or so, the warming will not be controlled. It will release methane, it will kill the coral, the arctic will become dark and warm, and there will be a mass extinction and mass

                If you want to vote on it, send it to committee, get comments, get negotiators to work through the ideas, and put together a real new deal. It’s not going to happen with McConnell in charge, that’s for sure. The green new
                deal is too important to play political games with, it’s the future of your children. But you probably don’t care, being a drug-addled godless conservative.

                Rushed means you hold serious committee hearings, get input and suggestions, have everyone consider the various ideas, and propose additions, not hold an idiotic vote with no meaning. It’s not like we have 12 years, we’re
                already going to have a catastrophe under any circumstance, just based on what we didn’t do thirty years ago. The 12 years is to avoid an apocalypse from feedbacks and uncontrolled warming which will lead to sterile oceans,
                no more insects, and maybe no more people.

                This bill is not a joke. It is spending comparable to the level of WWII. How did we pay for WWII? The answer is, we didn’t. We just inflated away the debt over the following decades. The Green New Deal does not violate the
                constitution any more than war-spending does, it respects private property rights, it compensates people for lost property or opportunity, it tries to make sure that the economy is healthy and growing, it is good for
                American industry, and it seriously is, by far, the most important initiative that the US has ever seen, this is not hyperbole, it’s more important than the original new deal. There is no future without a sensible path to
                zero emissions, and that requires enormous amount of coordinated reconfiguration of industry, a lot of research and development, a lot of deployment, and international treaties to make sure all other nations are on board.
                It’s not possible to continue living as normal without this proposal, or something equivalent, the drying out of the midwest alone will lead to food shortages, let alone the refugees from India and the Middle East. This is

                Of course morality is older than religion. But it’s WRONG MORALITY, it’s just a “sustainer of schemes of social cooperation” between the clique of people who form the ruling elite. It doesn’t have the presumption of
                producing a unified ethics for all of humanity which treats all members as equally valuable, including those outside the tribe.
            </p>
            <p>
                The WHOLE POINT of monotheistic religion, the kind people talk about, the kind whose archetype is Christianity, is that in order to make ethical judgements, you consider the actions which are morally right to be the will of
                a unified entity, whose opinions are self-consistent, and who treats every individual as a part of the whole. This idea means that the master/slave dichotemy becomes unsustainable, and this is the main effect of monotheistic
                ethics, to remove institutional slavery. That’s what the Jewish reforms did, making slavery temporary 7-year debt-bondage, that what Christianity did when it forbade Christians from owning Christian slaves in the 7th
                century.
            </p>
            <p>
                The pre-monotheistic ethical systems made judgements similar to the Nazi moral code– if it’s good for the social order, it’s good, if it’s bad for the social order, it’s bad. That is the kind of thing that leads to
                crucifixions and murder-entertainment in the colloseum. It can be argued that both are justified for “greater good” and “stability” arguments.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea of monotheism is that there is a unified universal ethical system suitable for everyone, in which nobody is counted out as irrelevant. All have a part to play. This is the idea of “The Body of Christ” central to
                Christian doctrine. Everyone has a part to play, and the least significant members, the ones with the least social standing and power, are the most important, if only simply because there are more of them (but it’s not only
                that).
            </p>
            <p>
                The monotheistic morality is simply the correct notion, and it displaced the older notions of morality, because they are garbage. That’s why there was a monotheistic revolution starting from the 1st century in Rome, to the
                20th century, as universal social-justice morality, this time under the guise of Marxism rather than Christianity, spread the idea to China, Vietnam, and Japan, places that Christianity wasn’t able to penetrate.

                There’s a difference between understanding Marx’s objective predictions and following his “ism”. Marx wasn’t a Marxist, as he said himself. The writings of Marx are foundational to economics, sociology, colonial and
                ethnic/gender studies, and power relations. Marxism is something like the first secular religion, sort of like a Christianity 2.0. It isn’t too good for making a theocracy, because any theocracy of any sort is stupid, even
                when the religion is true (especially when the religion is true!). But Marxism is good as a personal source of economic, social, and critical ideas about the humanities, because Marx’s ideas are by and large true, and extend
                older ideas nontrivially.

                What are you talking about? Marx is popular in academia because he made a nontrivial prediction in economics, regarding the dynamics of wages and profits during recessions (he didn’t say it this way, but the mechanism is the
                same). The predictions of classical/neo-classical market equilibrium models was totally wrong, and Marx discovered the correct “formula” for wages in unregulated economies, and for profits, and the division of wealth. He
                demonstrated that his laws held in England using numbers for weekly wages of various industrial workers, which he painstakingly gathered in an era where such statistics were not commonly used for economic analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                In doing this, he revolutionized economics and founded modern sociology. His ideas were foundational for all the following innovations in the humanities: first feminism, then racial justice, then gay justice, etc, all the
                various seeds of the modern ethnic/gender studies come from Marx.
            </p>
            <p>
                His thinking allowed one to consider for the first time MATERIAL CIRCUMSTANCE in analyzing the works of authors, and considering which authors are allowed to survive. For example, Dickens was born a working class fellow, but
                was extremely bourgeois in attitude, and this is important for understanding his writing (e.g., the Cheerables in Nicholas Nickleby). The 20th century was defined by a self-conscious attempt to avoid falling into the
                Dickensian pattern of celebrating economic success.
            </p>
            <p>
                There has been absolutely no one promoting Marx in academia. He succeeded despite attempts to bury him, which started while he was still alive and writing. His work is simply the foundation of all the modern humanities, and
                of modern economics. It was ripped off by Keynes to create modern macroeconomics. Keynes took the “falling demand” part, made up nonsense non-Marxist reasons for accepting it (his reasons are bullshit), and then created all
                the non-trivial counterintuitive predictions of modern macroeconomics, using Marx as a tool. Marx, of course, didn’t do that, because he wanted to end the system, not fix it. But he understood all the Keynesian effects.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, before Marx, using supply/demand, you would predict that raising minimum wage gradually, over, say, a few months, to a million dollars an hour, would lead to 100% unemployment. After Marx, you find that it just
                leads to inflation (assuming a printed currency) and destruction of monetary wealth. Raising minimum wage never produces unemployment, it first stimulates the economy, then it leads to inflation. This is something you
                understand from Marx’s ideas, as stolen and elaborated on by Keynes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Marx is revered in academia because he was the greatest genius the humanities ever produced. It is not the academics fault that various dictators pretend to follow his writings and take over entire economies with their
                political parties, that’s not what he was writing about. He was analyzing capitalism, and class structure.

                Keynesian economics, he says the stupidest things about the relation of minimum wage and unemployment (raising minimum wage to a million dollars an hour doesn’t cause unemployment to go up, it cause massive inflation which
                obliterates all cash reserves). He sold his intellectual independence for cheap respect and cheap money, because he joined the conservative idiots that prop him up, as their token black guy. He’s the worst sort of imbecile,

                nationals killed at the end of WWII are a crime against humanity. These are the Soviet crimes against humanity.

                I was an atheist, and remained an atheist throughout the whole process of experiencing God directly. Afterwards, I had to understand the experience rationally, and nothing about my rational world view changed, except I got a
                better idea of what God means, and what religious texts are talking about. It was extremely weird, to be an atheist going through a religious experience, but I can assure you that it wasn’t culture specific, much the
                opposite, it was entirely universal and personal at the same time, like learning how to prove pi is irrational, or some other mathematical proof. it’s just that each culture has their own mythology and stories attached to
                this sort-of universal experience.

                He is not coercing consent, although if YOU did the same thing in real life, you might. It’s a very subtle scene that talks about rape’s existence, without being a rape scene. It needs to to introduce the standard human
                psychological elements to this very new situation. It has nothing to do with coercing sex in real life, it really doesn’t, although it purposefully and deliberately references it, and also references back to actual coercive
                sexual encounters in older films. It just does so in a different context, where it isn’t coercion, although you don’t see it. In the older films, for instance, the Maltese Falcon, it is coercion.

                That scene is extremely powerful, it jolts a person, because it is so violent for a brief second, and then so controlling, dominating. But it is not a rape scene, it is a scene which is appropriate with a replicant who is
                unable to trust her own humanity. It’s like a crash-course in human sexuality for a month-old adult, with all the domination aspects, and the consent aspects, and then a demand for a free decision, not coerced. It’s a very
                difficult scene, because in real life, it would easily be coercive rape. In the film, it just isn’t. And to see that, you need to see the whole film, and understand the emotions of all the characters.

                “Dangerous territory”? Good films are not educational material for 10th graders on how to behave! They are designed to be revealing about the human condition. In the context of this film, Dekkard is not raping her, he is
                forcing a decision, showing how to give consent, because she doesn’t know anything about sex, and then demanding her to give free consent, because he will not force her. It’s a very human scene, made more graphic using the
                non-human characters. The situation is informed by the fictional parts of the scene, the subtext of her implanted memories. The fact that it resembles rape in real life does not detract from the scene, rather it gives it
                much more emotional weight, and makes it more revealing, and better. It’s not only replicants weighed down by implanted instincts in their DNA, not of their own choosing.

                And it can always be reasserted too, which is what she is doing, after he forces her to make an independent human decision for a change, without doubting her nature. Human beings are complicated, and rape is not a set of
                rules. If you came in that room and broke them apart, she wouldn’t thank you.

                Whether it’s rape or not depends on whether the consent is real or coerced. Her consent is obviously real in the film, and you must accept that it is not coerced, even though in real life, a similar situation can coerce
                consent.

                therefore how much worse communism was than fascism. To justify his absurd position, numerically illiterate Solzhenitsyn inflated the Soviet death toll to tens of millions, and began anti-semitic conspiracy in post-war

                You are unfortunately numerically illiterate. Let’s say you have a Katyn and a half, 50,000 murders, every year, for 50 years. That’s 2.5 million people. Remember that people are claiming 10 million, which is 4 times as
                much, 20 million, 8 times as much, 40 million, 16 times as much. I don’t think you understand order of magnitude. It’s ABSURD numbers. They are pathetically made up. You would need to have massacres every year to do it.
            </p>
            <p>The original intent was to make “Stalin was worse than Hitler” memes, that was Solzhenitsyn, who supported Hitler. The rest follow him to justify 90s propaganda which followed him. It’s all bullshit.</p>
            <p>
                There was only ONE Katyn size massacre, which was Katyn. It’s negligible in the total, like everything else, except for the ONE massive famine, the Ukraine famine, which claimed demographically 6 million from extrapolated
                population figures using normal birth rates, which amounts in real life to about 2 million dead during the actual famine (the rest being postponed births, dislocations, etc). There was only ONE great purge, which was the
                great purge, which claimed an exact known number of victims (all their names were recorded), of about 300,000. I add to that the executions in 1932, which are another 500,000 or so, perhaps double-counting the demographic
                drop, which includes their execution and lost births.
            </p>
            <p>
                That total, 1932+1937 is Stalin’s total death toll, give or take 10%. Everything else is NEGLIGIBLE. It’s INSIGNIFICANT IN COMPARISON. The only other event is the mass deportation of Germans postwar, which claimed about
                500,000 people from starvation and illness. You could add that, but then please remove the double-counted Ukraine victims. It’s a wash in the end. The end result is about 3 million, 2 million famine, 1 million executions.
            </p>
            <p>
                These other fictitious tens of millions of victims simply don’t exist. Conservative brainless numerically illiterate liars like you just made them up, and justify them using anecdotal stories of this massacre or that
                massacre, which are negligible compared to the main story. The main story, for total numbers, is 1932 and 1937.
            </p>
            <p>Any murders past 1953 (really, past 1941, when Stalin’s power was diffused by WWII) are negligible compared to what came before. You don’t understand “negligible”, and you don’t know how to do numerical estimation.</p>
            <p>
                The numbers I gave for the Nazis are accurate, because they are immediate postwar figures. This is what was used in the Nuremberg trials, when it was seriously investigated. Later writers are simply doing propaganda, and
                inflating numbers. It is not acceptable to say “6 million”, because it is not accurate.
            </p>
            <p>
                About 5 million Jews were murdered, 2 million Soviet POWs, and about a million Gypsies and others. The total is 8 million, and no further. That stays true no matter who your sources are and how much you trust them. It’s DAMN
                HARD WORK to kill a million people, as I tried to show you.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s why it’s so fucking INSUFFERABLY ignorant and INSUFFERABLY insulting when people throw these humungous numbers around like they don’t mean anything. A MILLION people is US traffic fatalities over 20 years, it’s US
                uninsured deaths over the same period of time, it’s US homelessness deaths over several centuries, it’s US police shooting deaths over 500 years. It’s comparable in the postwar USSR, you would need to wait many tens of
                thousands of years to get millions of political murders in the postwar USSR. The order of magnitude is wrong

                There were not 6 million Jews killed by Hitler. There were 5.2 million Jews killed by Hitler, that’s the postwar estimate, that’s the “five million” claimed by Eichmann, that’s the population data, them’s the facts. The
                number of Gypsies, Homosexuals, disabled, and Soviet POWs murdered might add to these to give 8 million total deaths, but considering that Jews were by far the main ones systematically exterminated, it’s not going to add up
                to 11 million, archives unseen. The estimate of Jews murdered might be high by 500,000, because its demographic, Jews in the Ukraine might have died as Partisans or from dislocation, but it doesn’t suffer from the “deferred
                birth” problem, because the death toll is more than half the pre-war population, and the results are pure subtraction, not subtraction after extrapolating using natural birth rate.

                All these numbers, including the Nazi ones, suffer systematic inflation in modern sources, I am giving you the original figures from the late 1940s, which are most accurate. 21 million is absurd anti-Nazi propaganda, and
                while I agree with most anti-Nazi propaganda, this numbers game must be rejected outright. I would say 5 million Jews, 2 million POWs, that’s about right, and less than a million other, meaning Roma, Homosexuals, Disabled,
                adding to between 7 and 8 million murder victims is about right for the third Reich. That’s a fair estimate.

                The deaths of the Winter War are less than the 1932 famine by order of magnitude, and are not crimes against humanity exactly. The deaths from all other Soviet events are swamped by the 1932 famine and revolt, and the 1937
                great purge. Those two events together account for 90% of victims at least, and they amount, at best estimate to 3 million.

                Regarding the superstition justifying the teleology, it’s the exact opposite. Once you recognize superrational decision making is the right way to make decisions, the teleology comes first, and the superstition is just a
                barbaric tool to get stupid people to follow along based on threats and lies.

                You have some misconceptions here. I am not dependent on any Judeo-Christian tradition, it is ancient and much of it is ridiculous. One needs to reformulate the ancient tradition to a modern person, who has a logical
                positivist naturalistic philosophy, and doesn’t believe in superstition, like such and so getting up from the dead. The concepts of religion are not really superstitious, they are primitive folk-tales made to explain the
                teleology of ethical behavior, that the notion of right and wrong is defined by allegiance to a larger mind than any one individual.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way in which such larger minds form is much like the way your mind forms from the activity of neurons. Like all the neurons in your head make up your brain, and their collective activity is your consciousness, likewise,
                the individuals making up a social group make up a god-brain, and their collective activity forms the god-consciousness.

                These gods are local and mortal, they are born and they die. The monotheistic notion of God is a God of gods, meaning the infinite mind formed in the teleological limit of infinitely large and infinitely ancient cooperating
                gods in the infinite future. This is Hegel’s evolutionary view of the 19th century, explained more concisely here, without Hegel’s upper-class bullshit. Removing the upper-class bullshit was done by Marx, who played the role
                of Jesus to Hegel’s formal, musty, obsolete, old-testament.
            </p>

                Marx took this teleology and made it a practical agent of change. First, he identified the main social dialectic, the conflict in society, as a class conflict— people who control vs those whom they control. Then he delved
                into mathematical economics, and explained why the system of control in capitalism leads to economic inefficiency. Every dollar of profit that a capitalist makes individually (as opposed to getting distributed broadly in
                stock) is a market-equilibrium distorting inefficiency, and when added up over all the wealthy folks, it creates unemployment and recession, the boom-and-bust cycles which were inexplicable before Marx.
            </p>
            <p>
                The economics described in Marx is simply objectively correct. That is independent of the teleology or religion. The prescriptions you adopt, however, depend on your religious teleology— whether you are willing to forgo a
                ruling capitalist class, or not.

                To see which method is appropriate, it is now instructive to take a look at Christianity. In the Roman empire, slave owners played the role of large industrialists, owners, while the mass of people worked as slaves. The main
                point of Christianity, ignoring positivistically meaningless superstitious nonsense, was to force the slave-owning master and the slave to share an equal social standing in the Church. Under those circumstances, the Epistle
                to Philemon explains, you are forced to recognize the evil of slavery, and free your slave. The Epistle to Philemon both explains Christianity’s success, and how it differs from Judaism. In Judaism, freeing the slave was
                also accomplished, but by a process of law, that took 7 years. The Christians eventually abolished slavery outright, by the 7th century, in Europe.

                The teleology of the Bible is that God demands that people do what God says. That is a circular definition, so people read the Bible and think that helps them know God. The teleology is what defines God, and to understand a
                teleology is the most difficult thing in the world. You can’t get it by reading books, especially not old books. You need to inspect the situation, and construct the best approximation to a future social contract which is
                optimal compared to the one we have today.

                the correct numbers, as a simple google check will show. Stalin’s 1932 famine claimed about 2 million victims, Stalin’s purges and trials claimed about a million victims, a bit less. The rest is negligible in comparison.

                You don’t seem to get this— the Bible doesn’t help you in knowing what God expects of you. The only way to do that is to “talk to God”, which means, having an informed, and reasoned, ethical conversation, without words, with
                the Jesus that appears in your head, after consulting all the history and science you can get your hands on, and recognizing that your introspection is limited and fallible even when it feels otherwise.

            <p>This process is not “I’m doing what I think it best”, because it explicitly networks with other people’s wishes and desires, and aims for a universal brotherhood.</p>
            <p>The role of St. Paul was to explain how to make such a community of universal brotherhood, among 1st century illiterate Roman slaves. Without Paul, they would have gone to Judaism, because it gave them hope.</p>
            <p>The purpose of Paul was to make heirarchical relations between people impossible, because they are forced to be brothers.</p>
            <p>
                When Paul says to Philemon “charge the debt to my account”, he isn’t claiming to have money, nor that Onesimus stole anything. The debt is slave-debt, people sold to slavery owed their value to their owner. The account that
                Paul has isn’t money, it’s the soul-value of redeeming you into the community of Christ, and that redemption is priceless. He didn’t pay Philemon any money, Philemon frees Onesimus anyway, because it’s required ethically.

                It’s very hard to do what is right, and reading law doesn’t help you, except by the example of showing you what it means to do the right thing. So when you look at what was going on in 1969, at the Stonewall Inn, you know
                that God is out there with the homosexuals and transvestites, rooting for their cause, and not with the goddamned corrupted police shaking them down. Even though the bible says the opposite.
            </p>
            <p>Similarly, the corruption of money heirarchies requires remedy. And if that remedy requires violating the 10th commandment, it must supersede it, because that, and not the tenth commandment, is what God demands.</p>

                Your comments are brain damaged nonsense. The key thing for population density is agriculture. If a society is nomadic, it has a low population, because the resources are thin. An agricultural society has 10 or 100 times the
                population density, because it can support it. Most of the disease deaths from smallpox came in the 17th century, and the Native populations generally rebounded by the 18th century, as people acquired immunity. Genocide of
                agricultural people is much, much worse than genocide of hunter-gatherers, because it is an intensive robbery of land, and massacre of people by starvation and resource war. Genocide of hunter-gatherers can be understood as
                displacement of hunter-gathering traditions by more advanced agricultural practices, and it can incorporate the few hunter-gatherers organically into a growing population. With agricultural people, there is no space. You
                must kill to take the land.
            </p>
            <p>
                Native Americans had extremely advanced Native agriculture throughout the continent. Tomatoes, potatoes, squash, beans, thousands of varieties of maize, domesticated llamas and turkeys, all this stuff we have today, show you
                that it was a centuries old tradition, because it takes centuries to invent such breeds, they aren’t magically created by nature. About half of the modern world’s crops were developed by Native American pre-European
                agriculture, it was the most developed plant-breeding program in the world, only exceeded by the USSR of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The reason? They had fewer domesticable animals, so their plant breeding needed to produce
                a full protein diet from strictly vegetarian sources.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Native agriculture was copied by new settlers in the 17th century, which was the only thing that allowed them to get a foothold in the New World. During this time, they raided villages for crops when their own crops
                failed, murdering Natives village by village, taking slaves and massacring women, children, infants. They displaced and destroyed the Native agricultural communities, village by village, all along the East coast, until
                finally, the remaining people were herded into camps, and then, in the 1830s, those remainders were driven to Oklahoma.
            </p>
            <p>
                This process was at its peak at the moment of establishment of the US. Your second amendment is not a protection against tyranny, it is a protection of the right of settlers to murder natives, who the government did not
                protect with anti-murder laws.

                The practice of genocide is explicitly promoted by George Washington, who spent his life committing such genocide. It is given a scientific patina by Benjamin Franklin, who argues that Europeans have an obligation, as the
                superiors, to take over the land of the inferiors. It is the central supremacist myth of the founders, even more so than slavery. The split with the British was partly because the British wished to protect indigenous rights,
                and refused to allow the genocide to spread West.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result is that the entire population of the 17th century East Coast, which is certainly as dense as any other agricultural society, it’s millions of people, and the nomadic central regions, was reduced to a few hundred
                thousand by 1900. The remaining Natives were herded into camps to erase their culture.

                Washington is turning over to complain to Benjamin Franklin today, in the pits of hell.

                The authority to be found is by considering what is right, not by considering what is written down. Redistribution of investment income is absolutely required for economies to function, and the elimination of slavery and
                power-relations is the central purpose of the teaching of St. Paul, i.e. the historical Jesus.

                The 10 million farmers lived on the East Coast. You can’t count them because they were so thoroughly exterminated. They were killed and their property taken, village by village. They were driven out of the east to Oklahoma
                in the trail of tears. The genocide you acknowledge in the West is the tail end of a worse one on the East coast. That’s why none of you Americans look at all like native Americans, while everyone else on the continent does.

                I am also a native speaker of Hebrew, idiot. I am writing this from Israel. Wives are referred to as a class of property identical to slaves in Exodus, Leviticus, and the entire Bible. The ownership of people is objectively
                a sin, and the gradual recognition of the evil is why slavery is limited to 7 years in Exodus, but only for Jewish slaves. In the Epistle to Philemon, we find out that St. Paul doesn’t accept any slavery at all. He expects
                all people to free their slaves, whether the law requires or not. Just because of their soul-debt to Christ. This is now the universal position of all religions, because it’s the right thing to do.

                The Bible is NOT the source of the teaching of Jesus, the source of the teachings of Jesus, as St. Paul explained is TALKING TO JESUS. By hallucination. Jesus is a hallucination that informs you about ethics. The way to do
                what God wants is not to read and re-read the Bible, but to use your ethical antenna to figure out what the right thing to do is, and then to do it. The Bible won’t help you, rich man.

                it’s not a good set of laws, it’s only an incremental improvement over previous more barbaric codes.

                slaves, although it did deprive your poor neighbor of property. Actually, perhaps it could be construed as coveting, freeing his slaves, in which case the 10th commandment is criminal, and you are a goddamned criminal for
                following it.

                No Marxist is out to take away your stupid rolex or Mercedes Benz. That’s PERSONAL PROPERTY, it’s not PRIVATE PROPERTY. A Marxist is interested in private property: a billionaire’s network of factories, in an industrialist
                who owns 20 large newspapers and 4 TV networks, in a billionaire who owns a sports team. It’s the power associated with private ownership of means of production that the problem and the target, it’s not coveting of STUFF.
                Nobody wants your shitty stuff.

            <p>This is why moderately wealthy people can’t understand Marxism. It’s not about YOU. It’s about people with investment and power which you can’t even imagine.</p>
            <p>
                It has no relation to “coveting” because the property is simply a state-awarded contract with no intrinsic meaning, aside from the social convention. When you say “I own a sports team”, what you mean is you own a piece of
                paper that allows you to take money out of other people’s labor from the ticket prices. It’s the society itself that grants you that paper, and unlike stuff, that contract is not beneficial to anyone, and should not be
                respected by the state.
            </p>
            <p>
                The structure of economics is entirely determined by which contracts are enforced and which are ignored. The Marxist approach is to redesign the contract structure so that labor ends up in the owning position, not some
                ridiculous idiot who happened to get his paws on the property deed. There is nothing to covet in a property deed, it’s like a feudal lord. You don’t need to covet their position, they shouldn’t exist, and you must revolt

                What a Marxist is afraid of is that Bill Gates’s control of stocks and bond stifle the computer industry, and that Linux is a better idea for free development. It’s not a matter of taking away your money or house, not from a
                moderately successful person who works. It’s a matter of restructuring large industrial ownership so that industries don’t end up controlled by 3 people, destroying whole sectors of the economy. It requires that people who
                work at a factory should eventually end up owning the factory. That’s the basic principle.

                If rich people who work actually understood what Marxism is about, they wouldn’t be opposed to it. It’s not designed to make rich workers poorer, just the opposite. It’s designed to free up business from consolidation and
                monopolization, thereby making everyone richer.

                The USSR decided that it meant “The state takes over everything”. The reason to study that experiment, as un-Marxist as it ultimately is, is to see what happens when a state takes over everything! Given the atrocious

                The reason Marx identifies duopoly or triopoly as indistinguishable from monopoly is that people in the owning class of the big firms can come together and act in concert, as if they were one person. It’s something that
                religion says is a good thing— cooperation. But it ruins the economic equilbrium assumptions. In modern capitalist economies, all large business leads to ridiculously out-of-equilibrium compensation. It’s theoretically very
                easy to see, because in theoretical equilibrium people all make a Soviet-style wage, determined entirely by supply and demand. That looks nothing like a Western economy, because investment profits are not in equilbrium, but
                concentrated at the top.
            </p>
            <p>
                This concentration of investment wealth does not make me covet, it makes me unhappy. Because it destroys the investment potential in an economy. It distorts the industries that get funded, and it distorts the political
                system. To get rid of it, you need to ensure that investment ownership is distributed about as broadly as small business ownership is, at least. That is, at least 50% of the workers should own the company they work at. That
                was not only a goal of Marx, but it was a goal of Reagan and Thatcher. You forget.

                You can continue to blather, but all those incidents, the Winter War, Katyn, etc, don’t change the numbers for Stalin— 2 million famine deaths, one million executed. They also don’t change the fact that the post-Stalin USSR
                didn’t have any comparable death toll. That’s the end of your propaganda.

                The USSR did go to vietnam and produce petroleum by simply digging deep enough. The reason people don’t do this is that surface oil is cheaper. It’s not EVERYWHERE that the Soviet method works, but it’s sufficiently likely
                in any region of the world that you’ll be able to do it in any country willing to invest the resources.

                There was no Gulag Archipelago. There was a small contingent of a few thousand political prisoners post-Stalin, and general terror. People were NOT taken out to the woods and shot. People were NOT summarily executed. They
                were put in prison, sometimes dying of bad conditions.
            </p>
            <p>That’s not to justify the totalitarianism, just to explain the figures.</p>
            <p>
                The complement to that is that in the USSR, as in Sweden, Mexico, Canada, China, Cuba, Denmark, Finland, England, Israel, Spain, South Africa, Australia, nobody dies of preventable disease. Further, in most of the third
                world, food is not processed and commercialized to the point that 50% of people suffer from obesity due paradoxically to malnutrition. The food distributed to poor folks in the US is so nutrient poor, you need to overeat to
                get a reasonable dose of nutrients. In other countries, poor people have good nutrition. This was also true in the US in the 1950s, before the food industry replaced the legumes and grains with processed stuff.

                Your system is responsible for killing thousands of people every single year, from poverty. You imposed it on the USSR in 1991, and it killed millions from poverty. The only proper comparison of the 1990s is with Stalin’s
                time, the 90s was arguably worse, just from death toll.
            </p>
            <p>
                So in the 90s, to disguise this, you simply increased Stalin’s death toll. First by a factor of 10, then by 20, then by 30. Keep doing that, perhaps you’ll sleep better at night. Stalin’s gone, his deaths are over. Your
                deaths still go on.

                I am not a supported of Soviet Communism. I agree it was totalitarian from the beginning until a few years before the end, when it was finally free.There were political prisoners, and repression until the mid-80s, and people
                were everywhere afraid to speak out until the mid-80s. It’s just that the NUMBER of political murders was extremely small past Stalin’s time, and the NUMBER of political prisoners was relatively small, and doesn’t contribute
                to the total death toll, simply because it is negligibly small compared to Stalin’s time. I am contesting the absurd numbers in the black book of communism, and pointing out that the total death toll is 2 million famine
                deaths, and 1 million political executions, all under Stalin, and all later deaths are negligible in comparison. That 2 million famine deaths, 1 million political executions is still intolerable. It’s just not the absurd
                numbers of 20 million, 40 million, 60 million, 100 million Solzhenitsyn makes up from year to year, and your right wing buddies repeat. These absurd numbers expose the abominable Western propaganda system. Isn’t a million
                executions bad enough? That’s what actually happened.

                I don’t know and I don’t care about Kolyma. Soviet citizens didn’t die of treatable illnesses, and neither do Italians, Czechs, Swedes, Danes, British, Mexicans, Iranians, or Chinese. That’s a problem unique to the United
                States. It costs on the order of 10s of thousands of lives every year, and it continues until this day.

                I never heard of Kolyma, and, before you explain, I don’t need you to explain. My goal was not to defend the USSR system. I don’t support even the low level of arbitrary arrest and imprisonment post-Stalin. I am not a
                totalitarian, and I recognize the brutal repression of speech and writing in the USSR postwar. I know the chilling effect it had on speech, and I can see the consequence in the state of the humanities departments in the
                Eastern block, which unlike the science, was atrocious. Precisely because academics were not free to speak.
            </p>
            <p>
                All I am saying is that the claims of right wingers that millions of people were in slave labor is a LIE. The claim that thousands of people were rounded up and shot is a LIE. The dissidents were abused and persecuted, and
                it’s terrible, but it simply wasn’t thousands of murders, and it doesn’t show up in population growth charts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The end of the Soviet Union, however, DOES show up in population charts, as a catstrophic decline for two decades. That’s because people suddenly were unemployed, empoverished, without health-care, drug-addicted,
                prostituted, and generally miserable. It happens in the US too, it’s the steady drip-drip of death of the underinsured, the street-people, the drug-addicts.
            </p>
            <p>That steady drip-drip is worse than anything that happened post-Stalin in the USSR, it is in fact, what is happening today in the former USSR. It doesn’t happen in sane social Democracies, let alone socialist states.</p>
            <p>
                The health care in Soviet prison camps under Stalin was atrocious. We’re not talking about that. The only goal I have here is to correct your WRONG NUMBERS about the death toll of communism, and to correct your WRONG NUMBERS
                about the deaths from poverty in post-USSR Russia.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have not looked at a single reference work in doing this, I have not looked at a single book, or web page, or literature source. I won’t do it either. Because it’s not a point you can sanely contest. I simply assert the
                true death toll, and repeat.

                The USSR death toll post-Stalin simply does not exist. It wasn’t 10,000 people a year (like those dying of lack of health care today in the US), or 40,000 people a year (like those dying of health care before Obama), or
                1,000 a year (dying of homelessness), or 10,000 a year from bad nutrition (obesity), or 1,000 a year shot by cops. It was 10 a year imprisoned for being dissidents.

                when I lived in the US. The USSR didn’t execute thousands of people at any point post-Stalin. They didn’t even arrest thousands of people. There were about 1,000 dissidents, each a celebrity in the West, and the imprisonment
                rate was one of the lowest in the world. The reason was just that there was no property crime, because, no property.

            <p>There were an average of 1-10 political murders a year post-Stalin. There were an average of 1000 political prisoners postwar. In the 80s, there were zero, the USSR was a free country in 1985-1991, like Yugoslavia.</p>
            <p>The Stalinist era dominates, and the numbers I give are accurate.</p>
            <p>
                The figures of 10s of thousands of deaths in the US come simply from those who die from lack of medical care, That’s tens of thousands under the ACA, it was 40,000 annually in the 50s,60s,70s,80s,90s,2000s. That’s 2.8
                million people dead, more than Stalin. Add to that the thousand of homeless deaths annually, the thousand deaths from obesity and poor nutrition, from suicide and drug abuse, then you get an idea of the toll of American
                capitalism. This toll is a comparative zero in Europe.
            </p>
            <p>That stuff is not a fabrication, because I personally know several people who were dying of treatable illness due to lack of health care, i.e. poverty. There was no such death in the USSR until 1991.</p>

                Officials don’t like to commit rape. They like to commit seduction, they commit sex. Like John F. Kennedy. Consensual random sex. It can be easily turned into rape accusations after the fact, so long as women don’t testify
                about rape. There was no testimony from victims, so I don’t accept the accusation.

                Sorry, the rape accusations against Beria are not believable, they are like the baby-smashing propaganda from the Yugoslav war. Let’s put it this way, unlike 1945 rapes in Berlin, for instance, I never saw interviews with
                victims. I am more inclined to believe that Richard Branson raped someone than I can believe that sexless Beria did. He was a torturer, so his victims made up sexual deviancy, as is common in victims of atrocity. People made
                up sexual deviancy stories for puritanical Hitler too.

                Lysenkoism didn’t lead to crop failures. It was a way of introducing seed diversity. It worked in practice for miniscule gains, it was just junk in theory. The USSR breeding program was the model of the world, it produced
                the seeds of the agricultural revolution which saved the world. Fritz Haber wasn’t responsible for anything but nerve gas. The Soviets created the fertilizer/seed combination that saved the world from starvation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The perks of the USSR high command were not material luxury. They were equivalent to a company car, a summer house, and being able to afford a fancy suit. This is equivalent to a high four-figure salary in the West. An elite
                precision machinist could match the salary and perks with assiduous saving.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was no class system in the USSR, the leadership didn’t get into it for material gains. If they wanted that, they could just defect. Defectors like Korchnoi were showered with money and favors. They did it because they
                were true believers. The system collapsed when they stopped believing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your claims about the USSR are simply propaganda. The claims about the US are blind. The states with no paper trail are the ones with the exit poll disparities, and there is no possible way the elections are not distorted,
                as the exit poll discrepancies are one-sided, always favoring Republicans, in exactly those areas where one cannot verify. That’s not a conspiracy of voters to mislead pollsters, it’s systematic election rigging, now made
                worse by purging voter rolls and instituting mandatory unverifiable electronic voting. This is possible in any state with a Republican controlled election commission, and if you took out the election commissions of those
                states and beat them with sticks, I don’t know if that would be unjustified. They should certainly be jailed.

                I have a daughter in the US, so I maintain my citizenship until I get her out. The US is no longer free, it is a police state worse than Tito’s Yugoslavia. To give you an example, Anthony Weiner was just sent to jail for
                imaginary sex-crimes. He was forced to tearfully recant in court, and the whole show-trial was tinged with atrocious anti-semitism.

                The communist and the fascists were both fighting for what you would call the “White working-class voter”, the difference being that the fascists instituted a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, what they called “class
                cooperation”, which means industrialists tell everyone else what to do. Communists took out all the rich people and shot them.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I was forced to choose between American capitalism and taking out all the rich people and shooting them, I would have to choose the latter. But of course, we now know how to confiscate their wealth, peacefully, and put
                the rich folks in their proper place.

                The supply of industrial tractors and new seeds in 1930s made the agricultural revolution possible. In addition, the “green revolution” of the 1950s and 1960s, which has been credited with saving billions of lives, this was
                largely a Soviet project. The Americans pretend they contributed.

                Katyn is negligible in your figures. I explained to you that all your figures are propaganda. Your literature claims that dozens of millions died in the USSR from repression, two dozen million before 1945, and another dozens
                of millions after! This is outrageous fabrication.
            </p>
            <p>
                As was pointed out, the demographic methods used in the USSR show that Hoover and Roosevelt killed 10 million Americans in the early 1930s. Hard times lead to deferred births, although a million Americans did die in the
                great depression, and a million die today, of opiod addiction, or lack of medical care, i.e. from poverty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Khruschev didn’t admit the Katyn massacre was Soviet, but he did a fair internal review of the 1932 famine and of Stalin’s cult of personality, and the attendant executions in the party. This is sufficient to include 98% of
                all the murders, the figures don’t change by a factor of 10 or 100 because of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I said it once, I’ll explain it again. 2 million people died of starvation in 1932. Half a million people were executed in 1932, and another half a million in 1937. That’s the end of the significant mass murder in the USSR.
                The rest is fabrication by propagandists.

            <p>
                The deaths under Stalin were 2 million famine deaths, half a million shot in 1932 and another half-million in 1937. Every other death is negligible in number compared to these catastrophes. They showed up in the 1937 census,
                and that’s why it was scrubbed.

                30,000 (Katyn) is much much less than 500,000 (1937 executions) or 300,000 (1932 executions), or 2 million (1932 famine deaths). The death toll of Soviet communism is 2 million famine deaths and a million people shot, all in
                Stalin’s time, with all other eras negligible. The death toll is nothing like the 1990s, which was an actual holocaust in Russia, with millions of people dying from poverty. These are the correct numbers. I said it, I will
                repeat it. You have no counterargument, because you have no other mass deaths except in your imagination. All your millions of victims are imaginary.

                The achievement of the USSR is that it created jobs for everyone at a fair wage. It industrialized and matched the science and research and technology of the West, for the most part. It was more advanced in materials, but
                less advanced in microfabrication (although it was catching up). It was more advanced in petroleum (by light years), but less advanced in pollution controls.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the reason there was any competition at all is because the West immediately adopted socialist methods alongside the USSR, in 1932 for the economic wealth distribution, and in 1957 for science funding. All the major
                problems of concentration of power in the USSR appeared in the West as well.

                Western Academia is generally useless until Einstein and Dirac, the radical Marxist socialists, took it over. I am a physicist by training, and my standards for academics is that they be at least aware of Marx, Einstein,
                Turing, and follow Mach positivism.

                The academic work from the 19th century is dated and worthless, and post 1991, American leftists were purged, so most of the new humanities stuff is worthless as well. The feminists were gone, the solid economists were
                replaced by Chicago school fantasists. The Marxists historians like DuBois and Foner were out, replaced by a new generation of fascist story-tellers. It’s all garbage.

                The 1937 census was scrubbed because it showed the 1932 famine. That’s the only serious demographic drop in the USSR from the repression. It is swamped by the 1990s catastrophe, from capitalism. I am telling you the truth
                about the death tolls. The worst death toll by far was 1991-2000.

                your research is accurate. It doesn’t change anything regarding death tolls, because all these war murders are swamped by the famine deaths in 1932.

                Lysenkoism was NOT an “utter dead end”! You have no idea how complicated biology is. Lysenkoist THEORY is wrong, but Lysenkoist METHODS worked to produce winter-ready seeds. Nobody knows to this day how it works in detail,
                or how well it works. But it did produce winter-hardy seeds by exposing plants to cold! That’s the problem— it was crap theory, but it worked in practice for limited gains. That’s why it took forever to get discredited. It’s
                also why Stalin just sided with the guy who got results over the people who knew theory. Lysenko actually produced winter seeds, the theorists who opposed him just knew that his theory was wrong. It’s a difficult situation.
                Some went to jail over this, others lost jobs, I don’t believe anyone was executed (not justifying the repression, of course), it didn’t rise to the level of an execution crime.

                If you actually knew chemistry, you wouldn’t fall for the nonsense you read. There is Kerogen, which has Nitrogen and Oxygen (like all living things), and there is Tar-sands oil which is just long C-H chains. They don’t look
                alike chemically. Tar-sands “kerogen” (it’s not kerogen, but your idiot pseudo-scientists call it that) is just dehydrogenated petroleum. Real Kerogen is biological residue. There is no link between them, and all petroleum
                is C-H chains without Nitrogen or Oxygen, and can’t come from living things.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further, Petroleum is produced in the USSR from boreholes which go down 30 km, where living things have never been buried. That’s one smoking gun. In addition, these deposits are contaminated with HELIUM, which is produced
                from alpha-decay. All commercial Helium is produced as a byproduct of petroleum extraction. Alpha decay is Uranium, Thorium, the stuff in the MANTLE, not the stuff in the crust.

                There is absolutely no shred of evidence for the biological theory, this was understood in the USSR in the 60s. The oil companies are not engaged in conspiracy, they simply continue with their bullshit by inertia and based
                on who the successful people were in finding oil that’s easy to exploit. That is, just like Lysenkoism. It’s structural corruption.

                The USSR was equally and arguably more advanced than the US in nuclear physics. Nuclear physics is usually a mess, but if you are a physicist (that’s my field), the Soviet contribution is obviously the greatest of any
                country. Physics was the Soviet science par-excellence.

                I am sorry, but you simply made up the millions of victims. They don’t exist. There were famine victims in 1932, and about a million people shot in 1932 and 1937. The rest was usual state blundering. You don’t know the USSR,
                and you listen to propagandists.

                String theory is partly Soviet, and wholly leftist. It was started in the USSR as S-matrix theory, and in Berkeley as “New Age Leftist physics”. It was suppressed because of it’s Soviet and leftist origins. Likewise for
                inflation theory, which is Soviet, Lasers (Soviet), Liquid He research (Soviet), Dispersion relations (Soviet), Conformal Field theory (Soviet), Chaos theory (Soviet), Computational Complexity Theory (Soviet), I could go on
                all day. Scientific progress in the hard-sciences mostly depended on the USSR for inspiration. The end of the USSR coincided with a dearth of inspiration.

                I don’t need any sources at all! If 20 million people died, I would be able to see it by polling about 5 Russians and Ukrainian acquaintances and hearing about their starving and murdered relatives and acquaintances. 20
                million people is a limited nuclear war. It’s a catastrophe. It’s what you see in post-Soviet Russia in the 90s, where every Russian knows someone who died of alcoholism, suicide, or drug-overdose. Every single one has
                multiple victims in their network. Because it actually was a holocaust.
            </p>
            <p>
                You see, I did this poll, with dozens of Russians and Ukrainians (I make a point of asking them about family history in the 1930s every time I meet one), and I know the order of magnitude of the death quite precisely. It’s
                of the order of “I knew someone whose coworker disappeared”, and “I heard about hungry people here and there.” Using no sources at all! Of course, it matches the 1980s figures compiled by responsible people, and not the
                stupid propaganda in that little black book. The figures I give are accurate. No matter how many books and sources you cite, they remain accurate.

                Listen, you dipstick, I am not a communist, I am being honest, not trying to push the system. Yugoslavia’s elections past the first one (which was certified by the UN as fair) were NOT fair, as the opposition had no access
                to media, and Tito instituted one-party rule. He JAILED Djilas for many years, he resisted nationalist leaders and shut down free-speech in the 1970s. But the economy was worker owned, industry was owned by worker unions,
                plant by plant, and central planning was abandoned in favor of decentralized Marxist socialism. This system led Yugoslavia to be the second best performing economy of the 1960s (after Japan), and the economy was the star of
                the East. This is why Dubcek wanted to copy it in Prague, and why the Hungarians introduced Gulash communism int he 70s (and also broke free of the growth constraints of central planning). Gorbachev was doing the same in the
                USSR in the 80s. The liberalism is compared to other communist countries. Yugoslavia in the 60s, 70s, and 80s, was approximately as free as today’s US, although not as free as the 1970s US, or Britain, or Italy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The elections in Italy and Greece were shut down by the US and British because the communists were poised to take a majority. I would not vote for them, but they were popular in 1946, because the Nazis showed the endpoint of
                capitalism, much as Trump does today.
            </p>
            <p>The claims you are making about rigged elections are absurd in a communist election— you can’t have a free election when the opposition doesn’t have access to media. It’s always going to be 90/10.</p>
            <p>
                Regarding American elections, your elections have been distorted since 2001, when exit-polls and results first diverged significantly (in Florida). By 2004, the exit poll discrepancy spread to Ohio, and by 2012, it affected
                a half-dozen states (although it didnt change the outcome). Today, the exit poll discrepancies are so regular, that they changed the formula for the exit polls.
            </p>
            <p>There is no “Shy Tory” effect, exit polls are anonymous. This is a fabrication to disguise election tampering.</p>
            <p>
                It is extremely difficult to hold fair elections in a communist country, because of the ability of capitalists to finance people who wish to dismantle the system. An example of such an attempt was Ortega in the 80s, when
                American advertizers ran a campaign based on his Rolex, not based upon his policy. Free elections work best when there is no individual able to buy them out, foreign or domestic.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I am sympathetic to the difficulties of elections in socialist states. But it is possible, barely. You need to institute careful controls of spending and money sources, and you need to instill a deep awareness of the
                importance of socialism in the population. Then you can avoid the attacks from outside.
            </p>
            <p>But in addition to these attacks from outside, there is the usual mismanagment and cronyism that accompanies socialist rule.</p>

                The leaders of the USSR were not wealthy in any material sense. Including all the perks of office, they made the equivalent of a high four-figure salary in the west. It was the resentment of their relative low pay and perks
                that were a major motivation to switch to capitalism in the 80s. Stalin wasn’t wealthy, and neither was Khruschev, Brezhnev, or Politburo members.
            </p>
            <p>Tito, on the other hand, was wealthy. This distinction was not lost on the Soviets, who saw Yugoslavian worker-ownership as a way to sneak in a capitalism for the ruling class.</p>

                It wasn’t a “manmade” famine exactly, it’s a collectivization famine. When I say “Westerners”, I mean “Bourgeois”, I don’t care if they are ethnically Russian, the Russian bourgeoisie is just as stupid as the American one.
                The 1932 famine was the shortest collectivization famine, it only lasted one year, which means it took about 2 million lives, which is a terrible estimate. I get it from demographic data. It could be 4 million, it could be a
                hundred thousand, it’s extremely hard to tell, because demographic data is terrible to source and very hard to convert to famine effects.

                The stuff you find in post-Soviet Russia is stupid. The Katyn massacre is weird, who knows what happened. I genuinely don’t know who killed those poles. The transfer of Germans postwar killed half a million Germans, as was
                acknowledged in Khruschev’s time.

                just to be safe), and these swamp everything else by an order of magnitude. That’s the end of the Black Book.

            <p>Lysenkoism was opposed by many prominent Soviet geneticists (obviously) and by 1970 was entirely discredited, as the USSR began serious genetic work. They never caught up with the West in this field.</p>

                Oil never comes from living things. This was proposed in the USSR in the 1950s, during the All-Union push for petrochemical sources, the Stalin version of the Manhattan project, it was tested and debated throughout the
                1960s, and it become dogma by 1970, as deep boreholes proved the theory correct beyond the level required for scientific certainty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the Soviets weren’t keen for stupid Westerners to catch up, some people did try to publish these findings in the West. They were universally heckled and derided. It is still dogma to this day that there is a
                biological source for petroleum. This is a pure lie. Petroleum is formed in the mantle, from methane, whose source is the same as the methane of Titan, it’s primordial. It is more correct to say life is a petroleum product
                than to say that petroleum is produced by living things. The chain of formation only goes one way.
            </p>
            <p>But because oil science is not public, it is nearly all in the hands of a heirarchical oil industry, this is impossible to say.</p>

                Similar Capitalist stupidity in the West is “Global Warming denial”, “IQ”, “String Theory is Bullshit”, and all the other flat-Earth level denials of Soviet scientific advances. Reading Soviet science is like reading

                The elections in Yugoslavia were certified as fair by observers, and the level of popular support for Tito’s rule was at 70% from opinion polling, mostly because the opposition were the fascists, who were just defeated. Tito
                maintained popularity by breaking with Stalin and instituting massive economic reform, created by radical leftists Djilas and Kardelj, who are the two heroes among communist leaders. Those guys actually implemented the only
                true Marxist government anywhere in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tito’s steps toward liberalization were only possible because the economic growth and trust in the system meant the citizens were not on the verge of rebellion. Yugoslavia remained a model socialist state until it’s
                dissilusion in 1990 into that genocidal civil war.

                Regarding fair elections, it is difficult for me to accept accusations of vote-rigging from a country where exit polling regularly diverges from official results in ways that always favor Republicans (or, in the case of the
                recent Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton). The elections in Yugoslavia and Vietnam reflected popular will.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vietnam’s government has governed relatively responsibly, including liberalizing it’s economy, and allowing for investment and growth. I would prefer if it were more socialist, but it is very difficult to organize
                large-scale economic projects without billionaires pulling the strings.
            </p>
            <p>
                The entire USSR infrastructure was a miracle, as it was constructed without a single billionaire getting involved, all by technocrats. The issue of lack of competition, stifling bureaucracy, lack of innovation, should have
                been fixed by the Kosygin reform. But since it was a decentralizing reform, it wasn’t taken until Gorbachev’s time, by which time the bourgeoisie reformed and overthrew the whole government.

                Ethnic minorities in the USSR were universally treated better than they are in America. There was formal equality on paper, with some discrimination against Jews (but not, say, against Uzbeckis). The “liquidation of the
                autonamous Jewish Oblast” was a failed experiment that was shut down, not a murder project. There were no significant camps after Stalin died, and at no point were the camps a significant contributor to Russia’s labor pool.
                The main labor was all free labor, seduced for this project or that, using money incentives.

            <p>
                The way you can figure out how many people died in 1932 is by reviewing statistics for how many people starved and were shot. Quoting you “… the population was still breeding at replacement rate or well above, so you don’t
                get a good sense of the death tolls simply by subtracting one headcount from year to year to another…” That’s exactly how Ukrainian mortality in 1932 was estimated, by subtraction. It assumed all internal migration was a
                death, that every lost birth was a death.

                Reading “The Gulag Archipelago” as historical is like reading Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” and using it to infer how women lived in mid-80s New England. It’s a dystopia, written by a man who became a fascist, it had
                nothing to do with Soviet reality. I haven’t read anything published since 1991, and I don’t intend to read anything further. The objective information which became available in the late 80s has been polluted by the
                bourgeois idiot takeover of Western academia. Almost everything you read past 1991 is pure propaganda.

                Mao didn’t starve 20 million people to death. Mao starved 30 million people to death. Not with his “five year plan”, that’s industry, but with his collectivization during the “great leap forward”. I get the figure from
                demographic data, 60 million people are gone, which is usually half deferred births, half deaths, so I divide by two (that’s also what I do with Ukraine famine). I also can confirm the widespread death from conversations
                with Chinese relatives, who witness whole villages starving to death in this era. It was the worst famine since the Capitalist Indian famine, or the Irish Potato Famine.
            </p>
            <p>
                One reason is that Mao was far more incompetent at industrial planning than Stalin, Stalin’s infrastructure supplied factory farming tools to the Kolkhoz’s to remediate the famine, and they had a good harvest in 1933 (thank
                God). So the USSR collectivization famine only lasted one year, and that was the last famine. Mao’s famine lasted three years straight. That’s how you get such huge mass deaths.
            </p>
            <p>
                No communist country adopted collectivization after the experience in China and the USSR. Instead, they prefer to divide property among peasants in individually owned plots. This has the advantage of being more efficient for
                farming, but the disadvantage is that it doesn’t free up a huge labor force for industrial projects. The point of Stalin’s collectivization was to free up labor.
            </p>
            <p>Mao’s famine is the worst crime of communist regimes. Mao was stupid enough to have no idea why it was happening.</p>

                Your claims are a hodgepodge of truth and Western fiction. First, most of the claims you make are reasonable, and supportable, so I have nothing against you most of the time. The one exception is “dozens of millions”. There
                are no dozens of millions as a quick survey of Russians and Ukrainians can show you. There were on the order of a million famine deaths in 1932, and half a million executions in 1932 and another half-million executions in
                1937, and THAT’S IT. That’s bad enough.

                The Soviet Union formed in 1921 or 1922, pre-USSR the population did decline. The Leninist government in the immediate post-war years was fighting a civil war, and confiscated grain and property. The famine was a result of
                mismanagment during “War communism”, but “War communism” was not a coherent econmic policy. Once the USSR formed, Lenin stabilized the currency by issuing gold backed bills, and stabilized the economy by legalizing
                capitalism.
            </p>
            <p>
                The famine during 1921 was a result of war, and was acknowledged and remediated. The famine in 1932 was a result of confiscation of lands, and the revolt was in response to the confiscation of land, not in response to
                famine. Stalin redirected food away from revolting areas, so as to subdue them. But the famine was widespread, it affected many areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                The “work camps” of the USSR post Stalin were negligible, and had nothing to do with the productivity of the USSR economy. You have to understand that Americans are SO STUPID, they believe that the USSR was run by slave
                labor in Kulak farms. They have no idea how people found jobs or got paid in USSR, how the labor assignments worked, how pricing worked, they don’t know anything. So they imagine a gigantic slave labor system. It’s into this
                mythical nonsense in the Westerner’s mind that the Gulag Archipelago plugs in.
            </p>
            <p>Your claims about Lenin’s famine are reasonable, but I believe they are wrong. My goal here is not to debate the finer points of pre-Soviet history, just to remove the obvious propaganda from the comments here.</p>
            <p>
                The claims I made about Soviet population growth can be easily supported. There was a decline in 1932, due to famine, the obvious war-causalties in WWII, and that’s it for obvious demographic drops. The post-Soviet declines
                are also easily seen in a chart of post-Soviet population of every Soviet province, and most ex-communist Eastern European states.

                Kulaks were not killed, they were “exterminated as a class”, meaning their property was confiscated and they went to a city and got a job, or to a factory farm. The Kulaks that were killed were the ones who decided to
                protect their farm from confiscation with rifles. There were a few hundred thousand of these, this is the Ukrainian revolt. They refused to have their property confiscated.

                He said it, but he didn’t mean it was a good thing. Stalin wasn’t out to kill millions, he genuinely thought he was building socialism, like Mao. He also studied very hard. The monstrosity of his rule was basically the same
                as any other brutal dictatorship, it wasn’t unique. The thing that was unique was the management ideas, which didn’t come from Stalin, but from millions of Soviet citizens desperately trying to industrialize, win a war, and
                build consumer goods. Those ideas weren’t terrible, some were copied in the West.

                I believe that there is such a thing as facts, and that one must be honest, even when you don’t like a system. Soviet communism was very interesting— it ran a huge economy top down as if it were a single corporation. It had
                a labor system which was in some sense an efficient free market (prices floated to attract the right number of people), the science was excellent, better than the West in most areas, and the general progressive idea was
                infectious. It was a very interesting country, and definitely what came after 1991 in Russia was a step backward.

                you did to Benedict Arnold. British sympathizers weren’t treated too well in 1790. I don’t support the death penalty, and if Arnold was sent to a re-education camp (i.e. prison), it would have been more humane.

                The Gulag Archielago is pure fiction, it has no relation to reality. I skimmed it. The good book by Solzhenitsyn was “A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich”, which is an accurate portrayal of Stalinist prison, and which was
                admired by Khruschev for that reason. Read that book, it’s worth it.

            <p>
                The Gulag Archipelago was propaganda for Westerners. It was hated in the USSR, because the author stopped being a truthteller and was only interesed in revenge against the state which imprisoned him, like Ivan Denisovich.

                The famine under Lenin was not “forced”, nobody suggests that. The famine that people say was “forced” was the 1932 famine, during the revolt against collectivization, under Stalin, during the first five-year plan. Get your
                history straight.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, in 1921, the Soviet Union was not yet socialist. It teetered between different economic systems, first hyperinflation and “war communism”, then NEP (capitalism). The Soviet Union became a socialist state in 1930, with
                the end of NEP and the start of the first five year plan.

                There was a famine in 1932 in Ukraine and the wider USSR, due to collectivization, but it wasn’t accompanied by widespread cannibalism. The pictures you are showing are from the earlier 1921 famine. This was used in the
                Hearst yellow press in 1932 as anti-Soviet propaganda. The famine was real however, and it’s effects were analyzed in the Gorbachev era. The number of victims is extremely hard to determine, because the victims of famine are
                generally children and the elderly, which are hard to disentangle from natural deaths and postponed births, which also happen during the same period. I would guess 2 million victims is accurate, half the demographic drop
                (which includes postponed births).

                The Gulag of your imagination is a Western myth. The prison system in Stalin’s time wasn’t used for labor, it was used as prison. There was no real gulag after Stalin, the crimes of the state were firing people unfairly from
                jobs, blacklisting them, imprisoning people in mental institutions and rarely forcibly drugging them.

                The communist state was not a system of slavery. You were free to choose your job, and applications for going to different places were generally not that hard to get. It was just overbearing and relatively empoverished, not

                The 1921 famine was the cannibal one. The 1932 one was much more limited, it was the response to collectivization and a revolt against land-seizure in Ukraine. The goal of this was to get people to come to cities to build
                industry, and it worked. The 1933 harvest was good, and the famine ended.

                No it didn’t. The gulags and purges consumed about half a million people in 1932 (Ukrainian revolt) and another half-million in 1937 (great purge), but that was nothing like the end of communism, where literally tens of
                millions of people died, and Russia’s population declined drastically. The Ukrainian famine claimed an indeterminate number of victims, perhaps 2 million, but the population growth after the end of the first five-year plan
                disguised this.

            <p>
                Religion and faith requires much more careful reasoning than anything else, because you are working in a domain where exact proof is difficult. It is not good enough to follow the past, because all past ideas are imperfect,
                as all of them are man made. When people say texts are “divinely inspired”, they don’t mean that they are omniscient or perfect, simply that they contain within them a spark of an immortal idea, like a work of Shakespeare is
                immortal, and so contains a spark of God.
            </p>
            <p>
                The nature of God is difficult to understand, except if you are a fundamentalist, in which case you got it all wrong. God is not a magician with a magic wand, as the current Pope has explained. God is a very abstract idea.

            <p>The proper view is of a limiting structure, a sort of super-entity, a super-smart brain which tells everyone what to do, so as to act perfectly morally.</p>
            <p>
                Such an entity emerges when entities play games with one another, and strive to make their collective decisions coherently with mutual recognition that they need to work together. This monotheism, the idea of everyone
                ultimately working together, means that they are supposed to make their decisions as if an infinitely wise agent who knows everything about everyone is telling everyone what to do.
            </p>

                To make this idea precise, you should explore the concept of superrationality in game theory. When you believe that all decisions in all games must be made superrationally, and universally so, so monotheistically
                superrationally, then you realize that people are to act in accordance with the will of a super-agent who doesn’t play any games, but stands on top of everything, defining absolute goodness.

                This entity is mathemtically consistent, but it is a limiting idea. So the only way we acquire knowledge of God is through debate. Hegel defined the notion of progressive debate, where ideas fight it out, and the best ideas
                survive, while the worst ideas are lost, and theses and antitheses merge together to produce progress. The progress defines a limiting idea of God in the infinite future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Marx’s religious idea was to take Hegel’s teleology and apply it to society. He imminentized the eschaton, he made heaven a future time, where people would act in accordance with God’s will. Except, since this is not the
                supernatural view of God, he didn’t even call it God, he just called it “communism”. This idea of striving toward a harmonious society, was Marx’s starting point.
            </p>
            <p>
                He then criticized capitalism by pointing out that capital accumulation is incompatible with ideas of economic equilibrium, and eventually leads to deep and permanent depression, where workers get paid less and less, and all
                capital is concetrated in a small owner class. He identified the struggle between the owner and worker class as the fundamental Hegelian battle of his time, and of ours.
            </p>
            <p>
                His progressive idea is that the workers must win this battle. He didn’t say that this is historically necessary exactly, he said it is possible that the capitalists will triumph. Marx just explained that in this case, the
                result is calamitous ruination for everyone, worker and capitalist both.

                The identification of God within the Marxist scheme was begun by Lunacharsky. These ideas were suppressed by Lenin, and only gradually revived after Stalin’s death. The USSR was more horrible to sincere progressive Marxists
                as it was to former capitalists, who mostly were able to maneuver themselves into positions of power in the party, at least after Stalin’s time.

                The Black Book of Communism is stupid, I read it. I gave you the correct numbers — about 35 million famine deaths, and about 2.5 million people shot. There is no reasonable dispute about these numbers, except to within 40%,

                The “100 million people” is made-up nonsense. 30 million people died in Mao’s collectivization famine, maybe 2-5 million in Stalin’s collectivization famine, it’s hard to be sure because famines are hard to estimate, because
                there are also deferred births in addition to deaths. But the numbers I give are accurate to best reconstruction. These are the biggest death tolls. The number executed under Stalin is about 750,000, including Kulaks and
                other “enemies”, and that’s terrible enough. Mao didn’t execute people so much, he “re-educated” them, so the terror was a different kind. The rest of the nonsense is made up figures by irresposible and stupid people.
                Cambodia wasn’t communist, it was invaded by the Vietnamese, who were. A serious account would say “2.5 million executed, about 35 million starved”, which is roughly the death toll for capitalism in the Indian famines, or
                the Irish potato famine. I am not justifying either evil.

                On the contrary, you can’t read Dr. Faustus, Edward II, or Jew of Malta, and not see they were written by the same author as Richard III, Henry VI parts I, II, III, Titus Andronicus, Merchant of Venice, or Taming of A Shew.
                Even Julius Caesar and Macbeth are still in a similar enough style, although, as Shakespeare, Marlowe advances as fast as he did as a youth. The Early Shakespeare works are completely continuous in style and substance with
                Marlowe. They are also talking about the same themes, have the same types of characters, and identical staging ideas. More importantly, the mathematical markers are continuous between the two in ways that are not reasonably
                plausible to admit if there are two separate authors involved.

                I am not a literature student, I never studied literature, as I usually don’t care about it. I only read the full body of work of Marlowe and Shakespeare (in order of composition date) after understanding that they are the
                same author. I am a physicist by training, and my evaluation of evidence is only by numbers, not by listening to humanities people. My main interest in this began when I reviewed the stylometric evidence compiled by Peter
                Farey and noticed that the stylometric data was strong enough to overwhelm any historical argument. This judgement has only been reinforced as new stylometric studies have come out, and the “Shakespeare Guide to Italy”
                provides the final straw, as it shows you Marlowe spend the years immediately past 1593 in Italy.
            </p>

                The echoes from Faustus are all over the Shakespeare canon, including repeated lines and sentiments, similar characters, and most obviously, “The Tempest”, which can be thought of as a sort-of sequel. If you can’t see it, I
                think you should stop directing theatre, as you have a tin ear for it. I hope you refund the theatre tickets to your audience, and let a competent reader direct the next play.

                The argument is that mathematical analysis of Marlowe and Shakespeare fail to find a good separator between their styles, despite much effort. This is unprecedented for two separate authors, it is overwhelming evidence that
                Marlowe wrote the work. Together with the Sonnets and the Shakespeare Guide to Italy, this tells you that the work is written by an exiled Marlowe. Shakespeare wasn’t a writer, he was a paid front.

                government spending. The effect is real, and it was Marx who described it precisely for the first time. You are getting a mangled version from the socialist website, the version in Capital is correct and modern.

                Einstein was describing the common-wisdom of turn-of-the-century German socialists. They advocated centralized ownership of the means of production, in practice, nationalizing everything, and then offering everyone a job at
                a more-or-less egalitarian wage. This was more or less implemented in the USSR during the first five year plan, roughly 1930-1935, so you can see what was happening with this model.
            </p>
            <p>
                Did incentives disappear? HELL NO. In the USSR during the Stalin era, your total pay was determined by how much you produced. If you worked double time, you got double pay. If you worked at a job which was demanding, where
                there was too few workers, your pay was much higher than others. to give people incentive to switch jobs. The allocation of wages was by a pure bureaucratic version of supply and demand, and it was pretty effective. The
                highest paying jobs were precision machinist, good applied mathematician, technical engineer, and the like. Pure managerial positions were lower paid, but you would get incentive bonuses for recruiting more people.
                Recruiting people became very hard, because unemployment vanished very quickly, as unemployed people were snatched up by recruiters, motivated to increase their pay.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result was favorable to heavy industry— steel production soared, tractors were produced, agriculture became factory farming, dams were built, and so on. By the end of the second five year plan, the heavy industry was
                sufficient to win WWII against a traditionally capitalist German enemy that controlled more factories. So the socialist model initially works for heavy goods, and continues to work for such things when it has been tried
                elsewhere. But there’s a catch.
            </p>
            <p>
                The centralized production method put all small business out of business, including small producers of agriculture and small producers of heavy goods, This led to a complete collapse of farming in 1932, leading to a terrible
                famine, and even though factory-farm production caught up in 1933, even then, it led to a catastrophic decline in all consumer good production. If you were talking about umbrellas, balloons, toys, paper-towels, everyday
                light items, the production was always terrible. The goods were produced at one central office, the results were of inferior quality and very uniform, and the products were chronically underproduced, so that shortages
                developed, and they were always stagnant— they hardly got better.
            </p>
            <p>
                These phenomena are due to the nature of government centralization, and Einstein was aware of the issue even in 1949. He, however, is unsure if this is not a product of the OTHER property of the USSR, namely mass-murder,
                overwhelming bureaucracy, and lack of democracy. By the 1970s, other societies had experimented with government ownership of various industries, most prominently England, and the results made it obvious that the problem was
                in the state-ownership itself. In nations with nationalized phone industry, you would have to wait months, sometimes years, for a phone line. In nations with private phones, you wouldn’t. It wasn’t just phones. Nationalized
                cars, nationalized anything, produced serious problems with service and efficiency that didn’t happen in private firms.
            </p>
            <p>
                The origin of these terrible inefficiencies is in the lack of ability of the government offices to restructure and advance, due to complete lack of accountability or competition. New ideas require a certain displacement of
                old ones, a “creative destruction”, and in cases where an office is in charge of, say, phones, the new ideas will be resisted by the higher-ups, who cannot abide losing their positions of power due to an influx of new ideas.
                Under capitalism, you just start a competing company, so you can’t stay still to survive.
            </p>
            <p>
                The same effect meant that the Soviet heavy industry, brand new in 1940, was an out-of-date creaking monstrosity by 1975, and started falling behind the West for the first time. Advances like transistors, which were
                developed in the USSR science also, moved into industrial applications at a GLACIAL pace there. The whole innovation cycle of product development was lost, and Soviet industry was entirely reduced to copying the West, even,
                most damningly, in cases where the USSR was the first to develop the science. Lasers were first created in the USSR, but commercial lasers only appeared in the West. The USSR just studied Western fasion, and didn’t produce
                anything original. Likewise in music trends, despite the ideas often emerging in the USSR, the widespread commercialization was always in the West.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason for such phenomena is that you need to be able to split and compete. The role of these operations is to produce economic efficiency, by trying out all options until you learn which is best. There is no substitute
                for this process.
            </p>
            <p>
                But that’s it! That’s the only modification one needs to Einstein’s essay from the last 70 years. The ownership of ventures does not need to be concentrated in capitalists, it can be broadly owned by all the workers. That
                doesn’t stop competition, it doesn’t reduce incentive. The firm might even be totally publicly owned, so long as you can split the venture and compete. An example in the US is Charter Schools, which are split and compete,
                but are publically financed and owned. There is no justification for capitalists, but there is a justification for market competition. The competition is something that it is hard to convince a government to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Socialists by and large came to understand this in the 1970s and 1980s, and advocated a system of worker ownership, rather than centralized ownership. In an ideal world, where you can actually have government bureaucracies
                split and compete, maybe Einstein’s thing would be ok. But in the world so far, it seems you need to have worker-managed non-monopolized industries. This is still socialism, as Marx would understand it, because it doesn’t
                have classes of capitalists, and the essential problem of chronic unemployment and boom-and-bust cycles caused by dropping demand disappears.

                Homelessness is legalized murder. As is war. As are cigarettes and drug abuse more generally. Still, I think cigarettes should stay legal, because, although I never take any, I think propaganda (like those awful pictures on
                cigarette packages) is more effective than prohibition in preventing harm. The act of dissolving the USSR killed millions of Russians and Ukrainians, as many or more than all who died in the horror of Stalin’s rule, look at
                a plot of Russia’s population. Does that mean that it was wrong to remove the communists? I don’t think so.

                Regarding American politics, in the 1880s, hard as it is to believe, the Republican party was a Marxist party (by that I mean that Karl Marx supported the Republicans, and members corresponded with him and with the European
                worker’s movement). The Democrats were a right-wing pro-slavery party back then. The Republicans and Democrats switched sides in the 1920s and 1930s, and the switch wasn’t complete until 1964 and the civil rights act, and
                the Republicans only went completely crazy in the 1980s.

                Abortion happens before consciousness begins (as does infanticide, incidentally). It is similar in that sense to assisted suicide, which sometimes occurs after consciousness ends. The question of ethics is difficult in such
                cases, especially in cases of rape, severe genetic deformaties, danger to the life or health of the mother, incest, and even when there is no ability to raise the child properly. That doesn’t make it right, but it does make
                it difficult to legislate. Propaganda is very effective in such cases, much as in the case of cigarettes and drugs. While in Israel, I saw a bus ad with a picture of a depressed looking extremely young women, with superposed
                text saying “Abortion isn’t child’s play, you will be left with permanent regrets”. Such propaganda is effective, perhaps as in the case of drugs, more so than legislation.

                Corbynites believe in worker owned industry, in prevention of monopoly, in selective nationalization in industries where competition has already failed, and in careful adjustment of market regulation to avoid concentrations
                of capital in the good markets that remain. To a certain extent, these competitive ideals were shared by Reagan and Thatcher as well, deplorable as I find those two.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the right is structurally unable to make progressive change, simply because it is the right. They don’t imagine new things, they copy the past, in this case, the 19th century. There is nothing to copy in Britain
                regarding worker ownership, it wasn’t Atlee’s idea, it must be built from scratch, and quickly. It happened in Yugoslavia and Scandinavia, with great success, and to a much lesser extent in modern Germany, so you aren’t
                totally in the dark regarding what to do.

                The economic problems of the 1970s were largely offset by the social gains, and in my opinion, Britain lost more than it gained on net in the 1980s. Perhaps I am only comparing 1970s King Crimson to 1980s King Crimson. The
                resultant change in the British left, if you are not familiar with it, it is documented in novels by Doris Lessing, was very healthy for the left, it makes it impossible to fall into the totalitarian statist trap again in
                the future. At the moment, the main problem we are facing isn’t totalitarian leftists, it is incipient fascism from corporate rule. The US is already likely past the point of no return, don’t let Britain destroy itself as
                well.

                I am speaking from that perspective. If you lived in a society where infanticide was legal, your first priority should not be to vote for the party which tries to make it illegal against stiff odds, rather, you should talk
                to the people doing it and tell them that they should stop, until you get 99% consensus. This is what happened regarding infanticide in the past, it used to be a common practice until the majority of people came to see it as
                a crime. Your vote should go to labour, and your preaching should go to those who do wrong things, especially in cases where they don’t know they are doing wrong, and it is hard to be certain.

                There are lots of things wrong in society, which lead people to needlessly die by the thousands. You are living in a society in which it is considered ok for a bunch of homeless people to die, and in the US, not only is this
                true, but it is considered ok for thousands of people to die of lack of access to health care as well. In both societies, it is considered ok to roll around places carrying several tons of steel around you, despite tens of
                thousands of people dying from smashing these devices. Isn’t 40,000 traffic deaths the most absurd preventable tragedy? Still, I’m not going to vote for the “abolish private automobiles” party. I would vote labour, and use
                my power as a private citizen to talk to people about only using transit which is driven by professionals. I don’t expect to succeed, by the way, so these deaths will continue into the indefinite future. But I personally
                won’t own a car.

                You need to vote about the things governments are supposed to do, and are realistically able to deliver. The Tory “wedge issues” are copied from American Republicans, and allow people to fall into the trap of voting for the
                worst possible economic outcome, all the while feeling morally righteous, despite their actions being collectively the worst possible.

                It is not valid, nor is it ethical. Labour is simply leaving the choice to the woman, you can easily persuade them not to do it, by using concerted anti-abortion propaganda. This can reduce abortion more than anything the

                course, the conflict over the appetizer and dessert are distractions. And the Tories exploit these stupid distractions, not because they are such ethical people, but simply for personal financial gain. You can prevent an
                abortion by not having one. No individual can successfully oppose gigantic industrial businesses alone. Only labour can restore Britain to sanity, and prevent the capitalist apocalypse the US has already endured.

                When you say “no one else”, you ignore the totality of all modern economists outside the US, and more than half the economists within the US. The only ones who deny Keynesian facts are right wing idiots who make completely
                crazy predictions. Nobody in the world proposes such garbage since the 1930s, except the Republican party starting with Reagan. Even then, in the Reagan and Bush administration, they only pretended not to understand
                economics for propaganda purposes. Now they are sincere, as a new generation has forgotten that the anti-Keynesian posturing was simply an idiotic crackpot lie.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not talking about opinions, I am talking about measurable facts. When you inject a sum of money equal to twice the total current money supply into banks through the central bank, pre-Keynesian predictions, modern
                Chicago school predictions, are that prices would (quickly) triple and stay there at triple level forever. Keynesian predictions say that this only happens at peak capacity, and in a recession, there is no significant
                increase in prices. Nothing happens. This is a clear difference you can test.
            </p>
            <p>
                We did the experiment in 2009. The money supply tripled. Inflation that year was around 4%, a little bit higher, but in the ballpark of every other year. It was the same the next year and the next. The classical prediction
                for prices was “~200% increase”, the Keynsian prediction was “~0% increase”. Which is more accurate? This is not a matter of opinion, this is a clear test. Keynesian theory, by the way, does not have a prediction about asset
                prices. The main thing it DOES talk about is the response of prices to money injections, and the response of the economy to wage regulations. I’ll get to that in a second.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Galileo dropped balls in the 16th century, the Aristotle prediction was that a ball 10 times as heavy would fall 10 times as fast. When the balls were dropped, the ball which was 10 times as heavy hit the ground “a few
                fingerwidths” ahead of the light ball. The Aristotelians saw in those few fingerwidths confirmation of their theory, because they did not go by observation. You are repeating this stupidity with hard data.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second prediction the classical school makes is that when you raise minimum wage (or institute any form of wage regulations), unemployment can only go up. This is a hard prediction. If you keep raising minimum wage,
                unemployment keeps going up.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Keynesian prediction is that unemployment goes DOWN as you raise minimum wage, until you raise it so much that every increase in minimum wage just produces commensurate inflation. So that if you double minimum wage again
                and again, at first, prices less-than-double (because people buy and spend more, increasing economic activity), and then after doubling again (once you are at peak capacity), then prices just double and all you have done is
                halved rich people’s capital. The thing to look at regarding minimum wage is ALWAYS the inflation rate, it is NEVER the unemployment. There is NO positive unemployment response to minimum wage increase EVER, it NEVER goes
                up! All unemployment can do when you raise minimum wage is go DOWN, due to stimulus induced growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is an INCREDIBLY counterintuitive prediction. It is saying that wages are COMPLETELY out of equilibrium! It is the exact OPPOSITE of the classical prediction. Yet, this behavior is not only observed, it is taken for
                granted by now in every nation on Earth. To explain this to you, when I first arrived in Israel, I debated a right-wing uncle of mine. We disagreed on everything, in much the same way that a typical Republicans and Democrats
                in the US would disagree (he, like most Israelis today, is further right than Republicans and I, like most Israelis of 40 years ago, am much further left than Democrats). But when I explained to him the Republican position
                about minimum wage, to my surprise, we agreed completely. Outside the US, even the far right has not forgotten the basic principles of 100 year old economics.
            </p>
            <p>
                And it shows in policy. Australia’s minimum wage is $15/hr American, for example. Israel’s is comparable to America’s despite the per-capita GDP difference between the two countries. Every country on Earth uses inflation to
                gauge minimum wage, not unemployment. For a reason. Because you aren’t paying people in gold, but in money that is distributed to businesses through banks. If they can’t make payroll, they just borrow for that month, and
                raise prices. If the volume of sales goes up, they don’t even raise prices, you just get economic growth for nothing. That’s Keynesian stimulus, and it works until you are at peak capacity, at which point, minimum wage hikes
                just produce inflation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The “catastrophe” of ignoring Keynesian economics already happened and will continue— it consists of degradations of standard of living, concentrations of wealth, monopolization of industry, and horrific crashes. These
                things are not solved by easing government power, or by removing interference in the economy, because they are a product of the market itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                The theory that markets are efficient in the absence of regulation and government interference is based on a MODEL, a mathematical model. This model predicts that wages are roughly equal, that unemployment does not and
                cannot exist, and that capital and money are interchangable. It predicts that injections of capital (like in 2009) are the same as injections of money (like raising minimum wage), it predicts that artificially raising wages
                must always reduce employment. These predictions are categorically false, and verified to be false hundreds of times since the 1930s. These ideas were understood by both Republicans and Democrats in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s,
                and even most Republicans in the 1980s. The Republican party lost it’s mind now, and practices what can only be called economic fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fundamental reason that markets don’t come to equilbrium the way that they should is simply that capital and money are largely separate. The people who invest are not the same people as those who work and spend and buy.
                There is no competition for capital positions, they are filled by an old-boys network. This situation in the US has been intolerable for a long time, and it will only get worse.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t need to be God to predict the outcome of anti-Keynesian policies, they have been tried with HORRIFIC results in South America, in parts of Africa, and recently in parts of Europe (Greece, Spain), usually due to
                American imposition of “austerity”. In the case of Greece and Spain, it is due to the unified currency preventing local currency injections, and the lack of an all-Europe mechnism for redistributing income. So they end up
                redistributing PEOPLE, by migration, with horrific consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anti-Keynesian ideas are disingenuous claptrap which are designed to protect individuals who hold capital from inflation. They destroy the economy, predictably, every time, in every nation. They have destroyed the US to a
                large extent.

            <p>
                If you want a policy which will help restore your ability to be an entrepreneur, you should push for rigorous anti-trust enforcement, differential taxes to tax large corporations more than small ones, and local blocks of
                WalMart, Cosco and every other national chain by regional boycotts and local zoning boards. You also need a heavy, heavy income tax to redistribute capital, and a stiff inheritance tax. These policies were constructed for a
                reason, they are the only way to get a market to effectively treat money and capital alike. Your business will benefit, large corporations will not.

                of stupidity and economic illiteracy, and people such as yourself must never be in charge of any economic policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mechanism by which raising the minimum wage decreases unemployment is by CAUSING economic growth. Without the minimum wage increase, a modern economy will collapse. You can see this by successively raising and lowering
                the minimum wage, and seeing the unemployment go down when minimum wage is higher, and go up when minimum wage is lowered. When minimum wage is removed entirely, the entire economy collapses, and people move into slums.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Keynesian prediction is completely OPPOSITE of the classical economic prediction, it is COUNTERINTUITIVE and SURPRISING, and nevertheless it is ALWAYS CORRECT, as verified in 100 years of minimum wage increases in
                hundreds of countries (and occasional minimum wage reductions through inflation, and occasional minimum wage elimination during periods of hyperinflation). There is no way to see this if you believe the nonsense you are
                spewing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason the naive prediction you gave doesn’t work is relatively complicated, but it can be summarized simply as follows— in the economy, wages are not in economic equilibrium. They are NEVER in economic equilibrium,
                because wages are separate from capital, and never equilibrate with it. This is why increasing the amount of capital threefold, as happened in 2009, does not increase prices threefold (or, for that matter, hardly at all).
                Capital and wages are completely decoupled, they are independent. This can’t be understood classically.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fundamental reason is that the people who use capital are completely separate from the people who work for wages, and the two classes hardly intersect. The separation between money wages and capital means that wages are
                driven to zero by competition with unemployed. This means that an increase in minimum wage brings you CLOSER to classical equilibrium, despite it being an intervention. It immediately leads to greater spending and greater
                economic growth, because it is FIXING A MARKET FAILURE. The failure is that wages and capital never come to equilibrium, because owners and managers never compete for their position with people who submit resumes and take a
                wage.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is impossible to run an economy when these ancient facts, long established, are denied by a major political party. This is why it is best to leave the US when the Republican party takes power. I have already done so, and
                I suggest you do the same.

                Whether you believe in “communism”, “freedom” or “slavery” not is not the question. The question is: when you raise the minimum wage, does unemployment go UP or DOWN. This is a question about facts and numbers, not about
                personal beliefs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The classical economic prediction is that when you raise minimum wage unemployment can’t do anything except go UP. It’s supply and demand. If you find that this is not true, then there is something seriously wrong with your
                economic beliefs. Classical economics predicts that the more you raise the minimum wage, the more unemployment goes UP.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Keynesian/socialist/Marxist prediction (they coincide) is that as you raise the minimum wage, unemployment goes DOWN. Then as you reach a certain level, unemployment stops going down and inflation goes up. Keynesian
                economics predicts that at no point does the unemployment go up.
            </p>
            <p>Which prediction is correct? Now this is a matter of experiment. The experiment verifies that the classical prediction is busted.</p>
            <p>
                One reason the classical prediction is wrong is because wage is not paid in gold, but in printed money, and in a modern economy, the extra money to support a higher wage can always be produced in a central bank, and
                distributed through lower banks.
            </p>
            <p>
                But even this is not enough to explain what is going on. The classical prediction says that, even with new money, intervening with an artificial price must always produce more unemployment, simply because it prevents
                positions from being filled at the economic equlibrium wage.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason this prediction is wrong is because YOU AREN’T AT THE ECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM WAGE. This wage is the wage at zero unemployment, where employers have to beg to find employees. At this point, it is hard to hire anyone,
                and wages go through the roof, and profits reduce to zero. This is the situation where a minimum wage would be “harmful”. I put “harmful” in quotes only because the minimum wage in such a situation of full employment is
                unnecessary, as all wages are sky-high and approximately equal, as threats of walkouts make it impossible to pay anyone significantly more than anyone else (aside from extremely specialized skills, sporadic work, high-risk,
                etc).
            </p>

                The failure of classical economics is made obvious every time you raise the minimum wage and unemployment fails to go up. The claim that classical economics is wrong about this is not about philosophy or freedom, it is about
                facts. You are wrong on the facts, and therefore deplorably stupid.

            <p>Minimum wage never produces unemployment. Minimum wage (counterintuitively) DECREASES unemployment until it produces pure inflation. This is Keynes 101.</p>
            <p>
                Even when minimum wage is increase to $1000/hr, $100,000/hr, any ridiculous amount you like, all that happens is that there is simultaneous inflation to reduce the value to the market equilibrium. The reason is that the
                businesses get loans to cover the monthly bill, and they raise prices to ensure profitability, and the system settles down to an effective sensible real wage. They aren’t paying in gold, and the central bank makes enough
                money to cover the increase.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to unemployment, wages in an economy are systematically and chronically too low to buy the entire industrial output. This is the main disease in capitalist economies. When you raise the minimum wage, you are partially
                correcting this market failure, and so decrease unemployment due to the increased economic activity. It’s counterintuitive, but it’s true, and you can’t understand this phenomenon without understanding macroeconomics. This
                is the main prediction of Keynesian economics, it is why macroeconomics exists as a field.
            </p>
            <p>The main question to answer from a policy standpoint is at what level does increasing minimum wage produce accelerating inflation. It never produces unemployment.</p>
            <p>
                There is a second question, of whether high inflation is in itself a bad thing. When inflation is left unchecked for long enough, personal investment become more difficult, because individual cash holdings are wiped out.
                Institutional investors like banks and businesses with solid capital are not affected as severely by inflation. So inflation shifts power from individuals to institutions, and reduces the influence of the wealthy, by
                partially inflating away their wealth.

                You have to raise the minimum wage everywhere, otherwise jobs will move to places where it is lower. When you raise it everywhere, unemployment goes DOWN, not up. This is the central counterintuitive prediction of Keynesian
                economics verified by countless experiments over the entire world.

                Keynesian economics 101 explains that wages are too low in economies, and when you raise minimum wage, this brings you closer to economic equilibrium (where there is no unemployment). In a modern economy, where there is no
                gold standard, raising minimum wage DECREASES unemployment, until it produces pure inflation. This is both theory and experience.

                It’s not “zero job loss”, it’s job GAIN. The macroeconomic effects of raising the minimum wage are always positive. It can only be negative in the sense of causing inflation. The inflation signals are what people look at
                when assessing minimum wage hikes, not unemployment. To look at unemployment is ridiculous quackery. At no point in the process of raising minimum wage to infinity do you expect larger unemployment, because the central bank
                always produces enough money to cover the temporary expenses to business, until the higher prices make up for the hike.

                The minimum wage does not produce unemployment even if you set it at $100 an hour. At no point does increasing minimum wage cost jobs. If you raise minimum wage to $100 an hour, you get nearly instantaneous inflation the
                next day to produce an effective minimum wage of (maybe) $25/hr, and simultaneous contraction of 75% of all the money capital. This is basic Keynesian economics. Unless you pay your employees in actual gold nuggets, raising
                minimum wage to infinity never has a negative effect on employment, it only (eventually) has an inflationary effect on capital. This is counterintuitive, and it is true, and it is why macroeconomics exists as a field.
            </p>
            <p>If you economic education doesn’t include the basics of macroeconomics, you have no business pontificating on minimum wage.</p>

        <div>
            <p>
                In a nominal curency enviroment (like every modern nation), the effect of raising the minimum wage to $25,000 an hour (and enforcing it) is NOT skyrocketing unemployment, rather it is instantaneous inflation. The businesses
                simply raise prices by a factor of 1000, so that the wage is effectively about $25 an hour, all bank savings are wiped out, and the effect is to destroy capital, not jobs. The negative effects of minimum wage increase are
                purely on capital, not on employment, and raising wages in this way is a method of ensuring hyperinflation, assuming there is sufficient money produced by the central bank to pay the government employees the new minimum
                wage, and sufficient injections of capital into banks to allow businessowners to take out loans for the first months to cover their suddenly higher expenses. After the first weeks, the higher prices and wages come to a new
                equilibrium at a thousandfold higher price range, but all money-savings are wiped out.
            </p>
            <p>
                The effect of minimum wage is paradoxical, because it is macroeconomic. The microeconomic response is higher unemployment, so if you try it out locally, for example, raising minimum wage in a state or a city, jobs shift out
                of the state or city to other locations, increasing local unemployment somewhat. The paradox is that if you do it everywhere, globally, raising minimum wage DECREASES unemployment! This completely paradoxical and true
                prediction is the main result of Keynesian economics, it is a unique counterintuitive prediction, it is Keynes’s parahelion precession of Mercury.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you keep raising the minimum wage forever, there is a crossover point where it stops reducing unemployment and starts producing pure inflation. This crossover point is at full employment (relative to minimum wage
                perturbation), and this is the maximum efficiency point for a minimum-wage intervention.
            </p>
            <p>
                This effect is completely opposite microeconomic predictions, because the economy is not near equilibrium. When you raise minimum wage, you partially fix the main market failure, which is that low-wage job wages are not
                determined in competitive conditions of near-zero unemployment. When you increase the wages past the point where this failure is fixed, meaning when there is already full employment, you produce inflation.

                I have relatives that live in a neighbouring town in CT, and when I visited I asked around. They know some people linked there, and they don’t have an indirect link to anyone whose friends were affected, or who worked on the
                periphery. The news media weren’t able to find anyone who know the killer to interview, no friends. If they found janitors and cafeteria people, it was obviously their day off, because none of them were interviewed.

                Just because it’s on the internet doesn’t mean it’s false either. There is no network of people around that school, there is just a set of grieving parents. There are no janitors, no cafeteria workers, no parents of friends
                of these children, nothing but a set of grieving parents trotted out on TV whenever there is a debate on gun control legislation. It looks like a hoax, and it is plausibly a hoax, because propaganda is legal in America now.
                That doesn’t mean it’s a hoax, but the reporters need to do their job and interview all the janitors and cafeteria workers, not the same set of parents twenty times.

                Any hypothetical “fudging of data” is irrelevant— it’s a 1-parameter system with solid theory, solid historical data and solid experimental data (the past 40 years). An extra unit of CO2 produces such-and-such warming, and
                we’ve done the experiment and we see that it’s about 1 degree of warming for the industrial output until now. The amount of warming is verified from polar ice-core data, which can’t be fudged, and reforestation won’t help

                The best immediate solution is pure nuclear power, with LFTR or other breeders, such a system can eliminate all climate concerns, replacing them with more manageable proliferation and waste management concerns. Using a good
                breeder, the waste is completely recycled. This research is underfunded, and both left and right wing refuse to move forward on a transition to next-generation nuclear power, because it conflicts with vested interests, and
                because older nuclear power has been unsafe. This needs to change quickly. Making nuclear power safe and waste-free is much easier than cooling down a planet warmed by 3 degrees.

                witness, so if 3 million voted, one of the 3 million could sell their story of how they were registered by some pushy party operative to the NYT for $100,000, and that’s that for the illegal registration drive. It’s a stupid

                exposed. This idea is pure fantasy— every registration form requires you to swear to your citizenship status, and there is no gain from voting. The ID is idiotic, you don’t need ID to vote, your neighbors are there and

                Alex Jones was talking about an inside job against New York and Washington DC in JULY of 2001. He is the first truther, almost by default, because he was talking about it before it happened. But the real intellectual father
                to the 9/11 truther movement is certainly Webster Tarpley, who explained most of the logistics of the inside job. I think he is spot on, but I am sure he is overstating the size of the conspiracy— I think it involved
                basically one person, perhaps a few low-level friends as well, so that technically it doesn’t look like a conspiracy at all. Just a plan.

        <div>
            <p>
                The trick to 9/11 is that it was done using military drills simulating the events. That means that thousands of people are involved, but all that these people know is that they were doing a drill which suspiciously matched
                the event at the same time. This could be a coincidence, they rationalize, so they aren’t sure they are involved. In this way, you can pull off any attack without a large conspiracy. In the most extreme case, you could do it
                completely alone, as an individual in charge of secret drills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the drills are secret, talking about them puts your job at risk. Still, despite this, brave people leaked the drills of 9/11 in 2002, to the consternation of Bush officials, so that we have a relatively complete
                picture of how the attack was carried out from the inside. It is pretty certain that George W. Bush did not know what was going on, and it is certain that Obama wouldn’t find anything suspicious by reviewing the secret
                documents that survive. The only person in the administration which needed to be involved is the person in charge of the military drills. All of them were under the authority of the vice-president.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the drills leaked in 2002, other drills dripped out here and there. Once you know that drills simulating multiple hijacking and crashing airplanes into buildings were going on that morning, it really takes willful
                self-deception to deny it is an inside job.

                I did not vote for Donald Trump, partly (but not mostly) because I do not believe he is a truther (mostly because I believe he is a fascist). Alex Jones was an early Truther, but he is also conspiratorial minded and believes
                other things that are nonsense. Webster Tarpley is the main academic person who cracked the mystery, and catalogued every single drill going on on that day, or around that day, which is relevant. Unlike Jones, he comes from
                the left, and unlike Jones, he doesn’t support other stuff which is more dubious.

                state (despite his promises to do the opposite) then I just might come back to the US. On the other hand, if he intimidates the press and stages his own false flags, I’ll stay out of the country. I think 4-6 months should be

                The problem is that secret documents are not peer reviewed, and do not contain the whole story. They are full of unsupported groupthink and assumptions, because they are not public. Further, those with a security clearence
                think they know so much more, when the extra information is unvetted. There is no secret document saying anything different about 9/11 than what we were told, they are just as clueless in secret as they are in public.

                Ask your friends to prepare for an assault on civil liberties, to find ways of communicating off the grid. Hitler was also supported enthusiastically by the Church in 1933, because the opposition was atheist communists. The
                Catholics only lost faith in Hitler in 1942. In the US, there are no communists to speak of, there are no socialists in numbers, there is no historical awareness of the methods of fascism, there is no organized defense
                against totalitarianism, and the militias in the South and South West are often racists on Trump’s side, although I pray they believe their own statements about commitment to liberty.

                It is imperative to elect people to election boards across the country who are not corrupt, and who will install paper voting systems which are verifiable. Fascists manipulate the vote, Hitler held a manipulated election a
                year or two after he took power, where the Nazi party swept the whole thing. If the midterms are corrupted by venal officials who refuse to count votes correctly, DC will be all Trumpists in 2018. Don’t look to Washington,
                look to your State Capital, ask your governor to watch out for DC, to monitor all Federal activities, and most importantly, if there is a terrorist attack, to BLAME WASHINGTON DC, not Muslims. The terror attacks will not
                come from Muslims, they have no incentive.

                nonsense, Breitbart will be their news source. They will believe there is a Muslim conspiracy against Trump, A Jewish conspiracy against America, that African Americans are “naturally Muslim” and have a bloodlust for whites,
                that blacks and Jews are planning to destroy white culture. You will see fewer and fewer brown faces on TV, and the ones that are left will be the most craven and paid-off collaborators. You will find Jewish and Asian quotas
                at universities and government agencies, and eventually, it can turn into the worst catastrophe any nation ever has to face. It can also be a world catastrophe, if Trump changes his mind and decides to invade other nations.

                I don’t expect him to leave the country’s borders, because he is a complete nationalist and isolationist. But this was also true of Stalin, who believed the USSR was large enough to be self-sufficient, and didn’t need to
                trade. Stalin used methods nearly identical to Hitler, and the consequences for Russia were catastrophic. Even if he is merely Putin, this is the end of democracy.

                I am speaking with historical memory, as I am Jewish, and my grandparents were in Europe. My grandfather was enslaved in 1940-41, and they only survived because they were in Rumania, which was Axis aligned. If they had been
                in their ethnic homeland of Hungary, chances were 3 out of 4 they would have been deported to Auschwitz in 1944.

                Trump ran Hitler’s campaign, if Hitler was alive today, he would sue for royalties. Trump plagiarized Hitler for the most memorable lines: “On the night of the reichstag fire, there was dancing in the Jewish quarter”, “On
                9/11 Mulsims in NJ were dancing in the streets”, “we need an end to Jewish immigration”, “we need an end to Muslim immigration”, “make Germany great again”, “we will put germany back to work on infrastructure”, etc, etc. The
                Hitler was evident to anyone who has ever read Hitler, which is why so many people made the comparison.
            </p>
            <p>
                Practically every theme was stolen from Hitler, either indirectly, by funneling through the alt-right, or because he read Hitler and successfully used him as a role model for a campaign. The biggest difference is that Trump
                is much stupider and less eloquent than Hitler was, and repeats himself a lot. Globalist replaced Jewish/Bolshevik, as usual in the alt-right, but the idea was the same: we are different and we need to be apart. Deportations
                of Mexicans replaced deportations of Jews, but the idea was the same: they are corrupting our pure culture. The white supremacist streak was completely unchanged, except I would rather say it more precisely: in Trump it
                wasn’t exacly racial, the racism was automatic and incidental to the mentality, the main theme was the wealth-supremacy, the idea that rich people know best. Hitler used less of that, because he wasn’t running in a culture
                that celebrated wealth. But it’s the natural translation to America.
            </p>
            <p>
                The theme of the campaign was disunity, the hatred of others and their exclusion. He advocated police-state surveillance, violence against protesters, and he projected POWER, power over the weak. His intended image was that
                of a charismatic superman, and his claim was that once you give him power, he will fix all the problems. He said this without giving details, and the few details he did give were absurd. This is also Hitler. The parallels
                were so exact that I couldn’t understand why ANYONE would even CONSIDER voting for him. Then I realized as election day neared, nobody else remembers Hitler anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
                After getting elected, he immediately calmed the country down by dropping all the racist rhetoric, and talking about unity. He put forward economic stimulus packages to let the economy recover. He asked extremists to stop
                harassing minorities, all the while making sure that the domestic appointments were made by rabid white supremacists. Again, exactly what Hitler did in 1933.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then he invited members of the press to a private meeting, where he told them that they were spreading lies, and needed to control themselves. Then by intimidation and power, he gets them to write fawning pieces about him,
                making it out that he is not so radical, that this is just like any other administration. So far, exactly following Hitler.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next stage of the Hitler game-plan is to install cronies in every newspaper, and shut down those that won’t do it, in Trump’s case, via abuse of anti-trust power and lawsuits. That silences all media critics permanently.
                In Trump’s case, that would need a repeal of net-neutrality as well, to silence online voices which are unfriendly. The next step is to install friendly generals, local governors, and friendly administration bureaucrats,
                over about 6 years. Hitler went after socialist labor leaders, Trump will go after Mexicans and Democrats, removing them from power.
            </p>
            <p>Kristallnach came in 1938, and the concentration camps for Jews. The mass murder started in 1940, and the gassings in 1942. That’s a long time, nearly a decade.</p>
            <p>
                Of course I don’t predict gassings and mass murders, that’s unique even for fascists, but I can easily foresee deportations even of Muslim citizens, after a few staged terror attacks. The adminstration can attack it’s own
                people, and blame others for it. This was a favorite tactic of Hitler, it was used to attack Poland in 1939. If Trump decides to deport Muslim citizens, that’s a deportation to nowhere. Deportation to nowhere is the recipe
                for mass murder— when a bureaucracy has people it can’t place, it will just make them disappear as cheaply as possible. And nobody knows about it, because nobody is talking. People just go away.
            </p>
            <p>
                You won’t see anything except consolidation of power for the first few years. If he succeeds, there is no Democratic party anymore, the leaders are in jail for corruption, and he is reelected with something like 70% of the
                vote. That’s what Putin did, and that’s terrible enough. It’s the end of American democracy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since he promised to run the government like a business, and since businesses are run exactly in such an autocratic way, I expect him to consolidate power. I don’t expect him to get impeached for it, because the party in
                power doesn’t care. I just expect him to succeed. What he does with the power, who knows. That depends on his hidden formula for making America great. But it certainly has something to do with making the white people strong,
                because his policies are about social darwinism with the implicit expectation that the ones who survive the culling are the most deserving, and usually, although not always, have pale skin. This is the Trump way, it is the
                exact opposite of Christianity, it is also the opposite of good morals, and it is simply evil. Evil in the most base and repugnant sense of the word.

                TV, and they aren’t outraged, they are just taking their lumps and believing all the horseshit they hear, and regurgitating it. So it’s hopeless. I tried, I’m outie.

                On the contrary, someone who is sane does not put white supremacists with no history in government and a stated preference for ethnic cleansing in charge of weapons of mass destruction. They have a propaganda apparatus
                capable of blaming Muslims for any atrocity that they choose do. A nuclear bomb in DC is extreme, but it does kill a lot of people who didn’t vote for them. Perhaps it will be a Sarin attack, or just weekly bombings. Either
                way, Bannon will be responsible, and Muslims will be blamed, until you have martial law, and internment camps. It’s not certain this will happen, of course, Bannon might be incompetent at staging such things, he might be
                happy with legal methods of making people’s lives hell, but I don’t think he will be. The point is, you have no protection except your state assembly and governor’s office, and they don’t have the power right now to oversee
                federal activity, nor do they have the armed militia, under their supervision, to implement separation should crimes begin to happen. If they did, I would not worry about the crimes happening.

                The national guard is state level, and there is no way state level government is going to be corrupt enough to fight their own constituents. You need to petition your state capital to institute a draft for the state guard,
                and to monitor all Federal activities for noncompliance with the constitution. I wrote a letter requesting this, it is in comments I wrote elsewhere on disqus, it can be bipartisan, it doesn’t require violating the
                constitution, simply a state by state draft and vigilance.

                Do not have faith— Bannon is no more ethical than Goebbels or Goering. The presidential administration, unlike actual terrorists, has access to nuclear and chemical weapons. The last time around, it was Cheney running around
                claiming nuclear attack was imminent, he was running the drills and exercizes around 9/11, and Cheney, unlike Bannon, had no ethic cleansing goals in mind— he just wanted the US to control Middle East during what he
                considered to be “peak oil”. Bannon says “ethnic cleansing does not have to be so terrible”, if he wanted to attack black America, rounding up and deporting Muslims (and their relatives) would do it, as millions of American
                Muslims are native born blacks.
            </p>
            <p>When you “deport” the native born, you are deporting them to nowhere, you understand. You are insane to chase after foreign threats and then install the worst possible domestic threat into office.</p>
            <p>
                I do not trust these people, they have never held public office, and they have shown only disdain toward the constitution of the United States. They need to be AUDITED from the only power above them, which are the 50 states.
                The states have leeway to ban Federal exercises in their borders, to audit all Federal activities, and to arm their citizens in a militia. They better do it, or else you will leave yourself open to Bannon terror. If the
                audits go well, and 4 years pass, maybe you can relax your guard. But in NY state, you would be crazy to admit anything from Homeland Security without complete inspection.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are not conspiracy theories, as they do not require any conspiracy. An appointee of Bannon could pull off a Sarin attack essentially alone, and Bannon himself could manufacture Muslim suspects out of nothing, he can
                put whatever he wants into the classified intelligence network. I am not telling you false-flag attacks are going to come, I see it as 50/50. But, quoting, I don’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.

                the system back. The results were fraudulent, Diego, it’s been happening for a decade. It doesn’t matter anyway, because states are allowed to do it.

                material collaboration with terrorists like the ACLU, who are trying to get the Muslims out, and who harbor them. You are crazy to elect someone who doesn’t operate under constitutional constraints, and you need state level
                action to bring the Federal government to heel. Now. Before Jan 20th. The first terror attack could come on Jan 21, for all you know Bannon is setting it up right now with two of his buddies appointed homeland security. You
                must get state legislation getting all homeland security out of your state, and audited.

                law enforcement on Democratic officials until he has a one-party state. Without Obama’s net-neutrality, the internet presence of the left will be decimated, because they will have to pay to stream. His genocidal power-hungry
                lackey, Bannon, will stage terror attack after terror attack, maybe an atomic bomb in DC? Maybe Sarin gas in Portland? Anything with mass casualties, and so acquire absolute power. Like his hero Cheney. Bannon will convince
                him that the attacks are not self-inflicted, but that Muslims are in a plot against the government, and that’s concentration camps and “deportations”. Deportations to nowhere, you understand, like the Jews were deported to
                Poland. You have to raise arms state by state, and audit all Federal activities, because you have no idea whether your government is constrained by constitutional norms. Hillary Clinton was terrible, but anything is better
                than this, including a temporary collapse of the Federal government, just until we can figure out what is going on.

                level, draconian and unprecedented state oversight over all Federal activities, a local state draft in each state, and a threat of separation if there are violations of constitutional norms. Remember, Bannon can stage as
                many terror attacks as he needs to institute martial law and intern all my Black American Muslim neighbors. He has the ideology to do it, and his role models are Dick Cheney, Satan, and the unspoken one. Adolph Hitler.

                Federal administration to respect the constitution, and you need state auditing of all Federal activity for the duration of this presidency, with threat of secession and armed conflict in case there are violations. Here is
                the letter, please use it. If nothing gets done by Jan 20 in NY state, if there is no ARMED militia in the state ready to enforce NY state’s will, I will cut and run:
            </p>
            <p>Dear Mr. O’Donnell,</p>
            <p>
                I am a registered Democratic voter in your district, and I am contacting you as a last ditch effort to try to avert what I believe to be a constitutional catastrophe, and severe crisis in the state of New York, and a threat
                to our democratic traditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am sure that you are as concerned as your constituents about the results of the Federal Presidential election. My concerns are not simply about outcome, but about process, as the exit polls in the states of Pennsylvia,
                North Carolina, and Wisconsin disagreed with the official results in a way that is not reasonable to attribute to chance. The election was, with some statistical certainty, not conducted honestly, and it is impossible for
                New York State to allow itself to be swallowed up by darkness through the election boards of other states without some measure of resistance.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am asking you to act at the state level. I will ask my mayor to act at the municipal level as well, but a city is more limited. I would like to impress upon you the urgency. We have very little time. It is possible,
                perhaps likely, that the incoming Federal administration will lack the scruples of previous administrations, and will use their position to commit illegal acts, atrocities, or mass casualty terror, and violations of human
                rights not seen in America since Jackson and the trail of tears. I do not wish to point out the parallels with Europe in the 1930s (and the US in the 1820s), but I feel I must. This is what it looks like when a
                constitutional republic ends.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am asking you if you could ask your fellow Democratic and Republican Assemblymen and Assemblywomen to hear the voice of protest of the citizens of the state of NY. and pass a risky measure. I hope you agree with me that
                doing nothing is not an option. This constitutes a best last chance to spare NY from authoritarianism. Please consider that in Trump’s America, the press will be silenced by lawsuits and all Democrats will be intimidated out
                of office.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would hope that New York can declare an emergency session of the Assembly, and announce an extraordinary circumstance, in which it finds itself unable to find full faith that the Federal government will continue to fulfil
                its Constitutional obligations to the state of New York. New York asserts its compliance with all Federal obligations, but requests, during this extraordinary period, full verification over Federal activities taking place in
                the state, or over its airspace and coastal regions.
            </p>
            <p>Under these circumstances, the state will set aside funds for the following extraordinary measures, to be implemented by the governor.</p>
            <p>
                1. Monitoring of Federal activity in NY state: the governor shall appoint independent inspectors for each FBI, ATF, IRS, and Homeland security offices, with overlapping scope and mutual oversight, to monitor each and every
                Federal agency and Federal employee in NY state. No communications from outside New York to the employees of these agencies shall be admitted which is not viewed by the inspectors, in full, declassified form. The inspectors
                shall be granted the required security clearance, and if the background check fails, they shall be replaced, but repeated undue denials of security clearance over any period of time longer than two days, or for more than
                five appointed inspectors for a given position, by the Federal government, will be considered non-compliance with NY state law. The inspectors will monitor all activities in the agency, and report directly to the governor.
                They will be given access to all work-related documents and communications with the Federal agencies, and shall be informed of the whereabouts of all Federal employees when they are tasked with doing their duties, at all
                times that they are on duty in New York state.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. A suspension of all extraordinary activities by the department of homeland security in NY, including: a. drills or exercises simulating any mass casualty terror attacks or response to such, b. interception of any NY state
                communications which do not leave the state without a state-review of the Federal warrant process and evidence, c. Federal search and investigation not explicitly authorized by the governor’s office after review.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. An amendment to NY defamation law: any defamation lawsuit coming from a Federal official regarding any potentially defamatory article in the New York press, or any medium distributed in the state of New York, will be
                considered a grave violation of constitutional norms, and shall be null and void in the state of NY. Suits brought up in other states will be considered a violation of constitutional obligations by the state of NY, and will
                trigger<br />
                provision 6. The party bringing up the lawsuit shall be responsible for damages and legal fees, to the extent determined by the court.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. A quarantine of Federal power to detain and deport within the state of NY, without approval from the Governor. The facts of the matter regarding each detention shall be presented to the governor, who will make a
                determination of the validity of the evidence. Any classified material shall be presented in non-redacted form. No New Yorker shall disappear into a Federal prison without Habeus Corpus protection, or assassinated, and if it
                is suspected that a New Yorker’s rights have been violated by the governor, a 2/3 vote of the assembly will trigger measure 6. Any arrest of political officeholders by the Federal government will have to be approved by the
                state of NY. During the period in question, an attempt to replace the governor of New York by Federal arrest will, with 2/3 vote of the assembly, trigger provision 6.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. The state shall institute a temporary part-time draft on all military age males and females, by lottery, to allow state milita to patrol the state, for the duration of the emergency period. The state officers will be
                appointed by the governor, and draftees shall be compensated for their time, amounting to one hour a week. In the event of an escalation of emergencies, draftees might be called to full time active duty. In the event of such
                an emergency, NY residents in the armed forces overseas will be called to return.
            </p>
            <p>
                6. If the state determines that the obligations of the Federal government have not been met, if there is a mass casualty event which the governor of New York is unsure of provenance, if there is any use of US military forces
                or lethal drones within the borders of New York State, or in the event of gross constitutional violations in other states, at the discretion of the governor and with 2/3 vote of the State assembly, the governor shall be
                authorized to quarantine of US mail, and individual citizens and corporations registered within the state of NY will no longer provide tax payments to the Federal government. The movement across the borders of the state of
                NY shall be temporarily suspended, and the militia shall enforce this provision with force of arms, for the continued duration of the state of emergency, or until the restoration of constitutional norms.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. A future Federal election for president, conducted with verified voting in all 50 states, with hand counted paper ballots and with fair access to all voters, between any future candidates put up for election, and
                conducted according to past accepted constitutional norms, will permanently end the emergency period, and void all these provisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. The Governor of New York State is authorized with these powers. Any legislation, executive order, or lawsuit by the Federal government regarding these provisions in Federal court shall be considered noncompliance with
                state law, and provide sufficient cause to trigger article 6.
            </p>
            <p>
                I beg you to consider that your constituents are helpless in the face of what amounts to a fascist coup. I do not believe this government is above doing the unthinkable, including arbitrary arrest, arbitrary assassination,
                and staging mass-casualty terror attacks in order to seize absolute power. If NY is brave, and declares tough measures which threaten, but do not yet amount to, separation, it is possible that a minority or majority of our
                50 states will follow suit, and the continual monitoring and threat of repercussions might be sufficient to insulate our fellow New Yorkers from catastrophic violations of democratic norms. It is too late to pass such
                measures after your members have been arrested and replaced, or, God forbid, disappeared. This has happened in other nations with national governments which do not make a good faith effort to assiduously follow
                constitutional norms.
            </p>
            <p>
                State monitoring of Federal activity is not currently forbidden by the Federal government, so it is a right explicitly granted to the states by the US constitution. It can be a bipartisan issue, as Republicans have no more
                reason to trust this administration than Democrats do, shopkeepers, academics, and a majority of US voters, including those that voted for the Republican candidate, are united in mistrust of the Federal government under the
                incoming administration. The fear of totalitarianism is nearly universal, it is everyone save those who have been appointed by the incoming President. The expense of the measures will be mitigated by the security you will
                grant your residents during this extraordinary period, and you will earn their gratitude and their vote. If you are first to introduce the measure, you will personally benefit from national exposure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please make sure we are not led like sheep to the slaughter. Remember that we have suffered already one mass casualty attack not too long ago, and we can ill afford and administration who not only doesn’t seek to avoid such
                attacks, but potentially looks forward to more of them, for an excuse to implement ethnic cleansing. Remember that the US has deported millions of people before, in the 1820s, and millions of people died.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not optimistic I will be heard, but I must make an effort. I beg you, do not wait and say “it will pass”, because all of history shows it will not pass. Please do not attempt to work with DC, the power structure of
                fascism makes it impossible to work with DC without corrupting your oath to the citizens of NY. Please hear me when I say that the evil of fascism must be resisted, at its birth, because the longer it is allowed to grow, the
                harder it is to resist. I ask you to pass this measure before Jan 20th. If such a measure or similar is not passed, I shall no longer feel it is safe to remain in NY state, or in the United States of America and I will
                emigrate, along with many of our more fortunate residents. I fear for the safety and future of my fellow residents who are not so fortunate to have friends and relatives overseas.

            <p>I agree with you regarding Waco, Oklahoma City, and all of the Patcon fiasco (including Ruby Ridge), and I voted for Clinton ANYWAY, because Trump threatens far worse. I mean 1930s Germany level worse.</p>
            <hr />
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>The incoming administration will do this, which is why we need to resist.</p>

            <p>Clinton also won the electoral college, but for irregularities in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and possibly Florida.</p>
            <hr />
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                We are opposed to this president, because he is the known path from electoral democracy to totalitarian one-party government. We are also suspicious of the exit poll disparities that suggest that the vote in Pennsylvania,
                North Carolina, and Wisconsin was not tallied correctly. This is an unprecendented assault on our rights as citizens, and New Yorkers can’t wait, but must immediately vote oversight over the Federal presence in their state
                for the duration. There is nothing needed at the Federal level beyond compliance with the constitution, a request that the incoming administration has shown no inclination of honoring.

            <p>Letter to a State Assembly representative:</p>
            <p>
                I am contacting you, with a prayer in my heart, as a last ditch effort to try to avert what I believe to be a constitutional catastrophe, and severe crisis in the state of New York, and a threat to our democratic traditions.
            </p>
            <p>

                New York State to allow itself to be swallowed up by darkness by following other states’ certifications blindly, without some measure of resistance.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am aware that you are not operating at the Federal level, I am asking you to act at the state level. I will ask my mayor to act at the municipal level as well, but a city is more limited than a state. I would like to
                impress upon you the urgency. We have very little time.

            <p>
                I am asking you if you could ask your fellow Democratic and Republican Assemblymen and Assemblywomen to hear the voice of protest of the citizens of the state of NY. It will be a risk, but I hope you agree with me that doing
                nothing is not an option. I believe measures such as the ones suggested below constitute a best last chance to spare NY from the consequences of authoritarianism. Please consider how democracy died in Germany a long time ago
                and in Russia, recently. Don’t let it happen to our beloved New York.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Under these circumstances, please, if you could, raise the question of setting aside funds for the following extraordinary measures, to be implemented by the governor.</p>
            <p>
                1. Monitoring of Federal activity in NY state: the governor shall appoint independent inspectors for each FBI, ATF, IRS, and Homeland security offices, with overlapping scope, to monitor each Federal agency in NY state. No
                communications from outside New York to the employees of these agencies shall be admitted which is not viewed by the inspectors, in full, classified form. The inspectors shall be granted the required security clearance, and

                b. interception of any NY state communications which do not leave the state without a state-review of the Federal warrant process and evidence, c. Federal search and investigation not explicitly authorized by the governor
                after review. d. fly-over of unauthorized aircraft.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. An amendment to NY defamation law: any defamation lawsuit coming from a Federal official regarding any potentially defamatory article in the New York press, or any medium distributed in the state of New York, will be
                considered a grave violation of constitutional norms, and will be null and void in the state of NY. Suits brought up in other states will be considered a violation of constitutional obligations by the state of NY, and will
                trigger provision 6. The party bringing up the lawsuit shall be responsible for damages and legal fees, to the extent determined by the court. Any such usage of a federal defamation law will be treated similarly.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. A quarantine of Federal power to detain and deport within the state of NY, without approval from the Governor. The facts of the matter regarding each detention shall be presented to the governor’s appointed
                representatives, who will make a determination of the validity of the evidence. Any classified material shall be presented in non-redacted form. No New Yorker shall disappear into a Federal prison without Habeus Corpus
                protection, or assassinated, and if it is determined ny the governor that a New Yorker’s rights have been violated, a 2/3 vote of the assembly will trigger measure 6. Any arrest of political officeholders by the Federal

            </p>
            <p>
                5. The state shall call for volunteers and institute a temporary part-time draft on all military age males, by lottery, to allow state milita to patrol the state, for the duration of the emergency period. The state officers
                will be appointed by the governor, and draftees shall be compensated for their time, amounting to one hour a week. In the event of an escalation of emergencies, draftees might be called to greater hours, or full time active
                duty. In the event of such an emergency, NY residents in the armed forces overseas will be called to return.

                7. A future Federal election for president, conducted with verified and audited voting in all 50 states, with hand counted paper ballots and with fair access without undue lines and delays to all registered voters, between
                any candidates put up for election, and conducted according to past accepted constitutional norms, shall permanently end the emergency period, and void all these provisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. The Governor of New York State is authorized with these powers. Any legislation, executive order, or lawsuit by the Federal government regarding these provisions in Federal court shall be considered noncompliance with the
                provisions of this act, and due to the unfortunate breakdown of trust between Federal and State government, it will provide sufficient cause to trigger article 6.
            </p>
            <p>
                I beg you to consider that your constituents are helpless in the face of what amounts to a fascist coup. I do not believe this government is above doing the unthinkable, including arbitrary arrest, arbitrary assassination,

                I am aware that a negative outcome is possible, that such a measure would spark national attention, and would be risky to yourself and your fellow Assemblymen and Assemblywomen. I am also aware that Federal colleagues of
                yours in your party in the House and Senate might advise you to wait and see. Please do not wait and see, please declare these measures. The monitoring and threat (not execution) of separation will be enough to force
                constitutional behavior from those in office, even if these people are determined to violate the law, as Bannon and our incoming president have all but assured the press they are.

                years, and prevent the Federal government from doing anything, by state non-cooperation.

                There is an upper limit to election fraud before it becomes obvious and leads to revolution, and Trump’s election is right on the border. It is impossible to skew elections by more than 5 percent without people noticing the
                discrepancy, so your work is not useless. It’s just that it’s not Democracy the way it was traditionally practiced, it forces total polarization, because the consensus point of 50/50 split in support is not the same as the
                breaking point for the election. It’s like a broken thermostat, and it leads to instability.

                The military doesn’t operate inside the US, it is unconstitutional. The national guard is like the state militia. If there is an armed national guard presence, the army would have to come back and choose sides. Each
                individual soldier will presumably side with their home state, not with the Federal government. That doesn’t mean Trump won’t use the military inside the US, but if Trump understood and gave two shits about constitutional
                provisions, all this would be senseless panic. But he doesn’t.

                If he decided to oppose state laws and use Federal law enforcement against the states it would cost politically, as it would require making it obvious that there is a police state. An audit of the Feds by the state is
                neutral and bipartisan, it doesn’t contradict any Federal law (yet). They would need to make it illegal to have state level audits of Federal activities, and this would lead to an outcry, and perhaps outright seccession.

            <p>I think Republicans want Federal audits by their own states too, and it could pass all 50 states but I think it is politically impossible. But so was Trump winning, so I will try until Jan 20th, and then I’ll cut and run.</p>

                It is not illegal to pay people to protest, you numbskull. But as a New York resident who is going to protests, you can rest assured that any “paid protester” is outnumbered 1000 to 1 by unpaid protesters. This is not the
                tea party, I am going to protest to save my state and city of NY. I have no interest in the rest of the country, as my state was the biggest victim last time you put fascists in power.

                The only way to prevent a hundred new 9/11 style attacks, all blamed on non-existent terrorists, is to quarantine Federal agents in NY with state-appointed folks who will read all their communications with DC, and exercize a
                veto over any decision to hold a drill, to eavesdrop on communications, or intern or arrest anyone. The state officials must be appointed by my governor, and they must recieve the same security clearance as those they audit.
                Nothing the Federal government does in New York can be assumed to be safe.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the Federal government protests, New York state will withhold all Federal tax dollars and use the surplus between the expenditures and payments to institute a state militia draft and arm the state national guard. It would
                also be good to print a local currency for the state, just in case there is some Federal pushback. This is the only reasonable step, it should be constitutional, as the constitution guarantees all rights not enumerated to
                the Federal government to the states. Printing a currency certainly is OK.

                I don’t want to see a single FBI, ATF, CIA, or Homeland Security office in my state without a swarm of state agents peering over everyone’s shoulder, looking at every order from DC, and every document. I don’t want a single
                drill, a single Federal arrest in NY which is not authorized by the state, a single deportation not authorized by the state.

                NY must threaten civil war in order to get safety for it’s citizens. As for the rest of you, you can pass similar measures in your own states, or go fuck yourselves, I don’t give a shit. You dumped this horror on us after
                what we suffered under Bush, I don’t think you are particularly deserving of our pity.

            <p>
                The only solution is to threaten Trump with civil war, by arming militias state by state, and temporarily “quarantining” Federal agencies in each state. If the Federal government tries to stop you, you threaten to withhold
                taxes. The threat of civil war is the only way to get anything at all out of this group, and I am not sure it will be an empty threat. In any case, you need a weapon at home.

                You are not taking the proper point of view. The DP is not going to help you now, you need to talk to your state representatives to try to audit Federal activities. Every state law which is not directly contradicting a
                Federal law is constitutional. You need to make sure every Federal office in your state has a state officer reviewing all communications with Washington, with the same security clearance. You also need to ensure that
                homeland security activities are monitored and controlled inside each state, and issue a state-level statement of a moratorium on Federal presence if the audit is not complied with. You need to forbid homeland security from
                conducting exercizes of any sort in your state, to prevent false-flag attacks. You also need to arm the state national guard, and raise emergency taxes to pay for it in each state, because the Feds aren’t going to pay
                anymore. I am not optimistic any of these measures will pass anywhere, but they must get done before Jan 20, you need to know EVERYTHING the Federal government is doing at the state and municipal level, down to the last
                detail. This is a non-partisan proposal, it makes the Federal government more accountable to local officials, and it allows you to know when it is time to stop sending tax reciepts to Washington and focus on protecting your
                own citizens.

                The different human circumstances are insignificant. The campaign was run by Bannon, not by Trump, and Bannon supplies all the personel and ideas. Bannon is not a billionaire, and shares Hitler’s philosophy. Trump himself
                could be substituted with any mega-star, or a blue cartoon character, as in the British television series “Black Mirror”.

                The substance of the campaign was identical to Hitler’s, down to the last detail. Hitler won a 44% plurality before a fake terror attack allowed him to take absolute power, Trump won a roughly 44% plurality (adjusted by
                Republican controlled election offices to his margin of victory in various states). The opposition doesn’t matter anymore, this is a fascist coup, they will be silenced and ignored.

                The charge that the protesters are paid is a terribly frightening omen of things to come. The charge allows you to imprison leftists for “material support of terrorism” because they donated to Democracy for America. Tea
                party protesters were paid indirectly, by Koch brothers financing the organizations so involved, and when Obama audited these organizations finances, he was accused of using the IRS for political payback. Trump is not
                threatening to audit the protesters, he is threatening to put them away.

                It’s not illegal to pay people to protest, but none of the people protesting Trump are paid a dime. This wave of propaganda is the first attempt to control the opposition and set up a police state, and nothing like this kind

                Hitler had no problem with individual Jews, he had a Jewish doctor. He had a problem with what he considered the infestation of Western civilization with Jewish influence. Trump is the same regarding Muslims. The only
                possible resistance is at the state level, to audit any Federal government activities, and threaten withholding Federal tax reciepts if state-level audits of all Federal activities are resisted in any way. One must also
                invest in arming the state national guard, and preparing for possible strife. Only the threat of insurrection can work as a deterrant, otherwise there will be weekly terror attacks blamed on “Muslim terrorists” until there
                are no more civil liberties. This election was conducted fraudulently, you must examine the exit polls to see this, Trump got no more votes than Hitler did (44%), and one cannot submit.

                Ayn Rand, except more collectivist. The same philosophy, more or less, is shared by Bannon and the white supremacists.

                It didn’t favor Hillary. All the discrepencies in the primary favored Bernie, by sometimes ridiculous margins, as in NY, where Bernie lost by 4 points in the exit poll and by some astronomical amount in the official count.
                Some Southern states reported official margins of 90/10 or 80/20, when the exit polls had 70/30 or better.

                Listen, you gullible fool, I know Trump’s VOTERS are by and large not explicit racists! I know Trump himself is not explicitly racist (he is only too stupid to understand bigotry well enough to avoid unconscious spontaneous
                bigotry), but his CAMPAIGN MANAGER and MINISTER OF PROPAGANDA Bannon is a white supremacist, and he dictates the tone. He also can control the policy through staff choices, and he can implement a white supremacist agenda
                very easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bannon is mostly anti-goodness, and anti-monotheism. Like Hitler, his hatred is not exactly of Jews as a race, but of the “weakening” philosophy of inclusion, loving your fellow man, and unity. He is a separatist, and
                believes there is a separate God for white people.
            </p>
            <p>
                The small number of minority voters who voted for him assumed he is attacking SOME OTHER MINORITY, not them, and think that only THEIR OWN PERSONAL BIGOTRY is being supported. Hispanics think “Oh, he’s attacking illegals and
                terrorists.” Blacks think “Oh, he is attacking Jews”. Jews think “Oh, he is attacking Muslims”. Every group is blind to the hatred toward themselves, because they don’t hear their own dog-whistles. The only ones who see
                through the crap are moderately educated people or nearly all black people of any education level.

                The MSM knows that reporting election fraud is the road to destabilization and riots. It has led to revolution in several countries. So by a “gentlemen’s agreement”, they simply don’t write about it. The only way to fix
                Democratic party primary fraud is to get the leadership ousted, which we did. Then to put progressive leaders in, which we are doing now. There’s no recourse from the government.

                But Federal election fraud makes a country unliveable. Kerry would have been able to reverse Bush era measures more than Obama has. I don’t like this guy’s silence during the primary, but that’s not the issue at present. The
                issue at present is that there are two months left until you get Giuliani doing whatever he wants with homeland security, and staging whatever number of Reichstags he needs to get a one-party state.

                I accept that isolated polls can make a mistake with new parties, because they don’t know who or where to ask. I accept that there was a margin of error in each state. But ALL the discrepancies for 16 years have favored
                Republicans, and they are largest in states with no paper trail. The results of this election suggest tampering at the 5% level, as cumulatively, the one-way shift in votes is too improbable to occur by chance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally, exit polls in the US are pretty thorough and well tested for systematics, because the methodology is steady over decades, and the party situation is extremely stable. The media polls were used for decades with no
                problem, because they know the statistical adjustments. Despite the horror of both candidates (Trump was only about ten times as horrible as Clinton— she has also supported police state measures, including limits on internet
                speech, surveillance, homeland security, and used Gestapo tactics against Republicans in PATCON) Still, in terms of results, this was a relatively standard Democrat/Republican election.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only window of opportunity for grassroots movement is when people aren’t being terrorized and deported left and right. I was around in 1999, and 2000. I had a friend who protested this, protested that. She asked me to
                protest, and I said “I’m not that dissatisfied at present”. In 2001, after 9/11, the Iraq war, detentions, etc, I asked her where to protest. She didn’t know, because there were no protests left. Everyone had been
                intimidated into silence. There were no protests again until Obama allowed freedom.
            </p>
            <p>This is what happened in Nazi Germany as well. There was no protests, there were partisans in the woods.</p>

                The reason is that constitutionally, it is up to the states to certify elections, and it is within each state that the challenges have to happen. The red states have been Republican so long, and this tactic so enshrined, it
                was legalized by the 2002 “help American vote” act, and the 2013 rejection of the Civil-Rights era voting rights act. This means that elections are state-level again, and it is basically impossible to audit and demonstrate
                fraud nationally, aside from looking at exit polls. Hence the Republican Jim-Crow tactics and simultaneous attack on exit polling (and polling in general). The Democrats have very little presence in these states, they can’t
                do anything to fix this, you basically have to trust the Republicans. This was Karl Rove’s strategy—take over one state election board at a time, until you produce a permanent Republican majority.
            </p>
            <p>One must not trust Republicans anymore. Not since they gave Kathleen Harris a job after her work in 2000. Not on this, not on anything. I should add that Democrats did similar fraud in an earlier era.</p>
            <p>
                It simply means that you can’t have a meaningful Democratic governance in a union including these states. Until such a time when you can trust their election boards, they will impose their one-party system on the rest of us,
                and with candidates increasingly more atrocious.

                The “power” to do this is not in Republican power brokers. This is done by individual Republican state election officers, armed with a memory stick and a text editor. They are responsible for tabulating and certifying the
                election, and also for doing the audit. They have no Federal oversight, or any oversight at all. These are rank-and-file Republicans, and they have been adjusting the tabulation in their favor for a decade now, regardless of
                candidate, as can be seen by the gradual divergence of exit-polls and results over the decade, only in Republican controlled states.

                The effect is much more corrosive, as people vote to make the vote come close, in the case when both candidates are hated, as in this case. This election must not be accepted if you don’t wish to live in a police state. Not
                that Trump wants a police state, mind you, he’s just too stupid to see through whatever his underlings will tell him is happening. With 3 or 4 terrorist attacks, his underlings can get him to shut up the entire press. With a
                simple repeal of net-neutrality, he can guarantee that only big-business can stream internet content to you, and slow-down any opposition content to the point that it disappears. With sufficient surveillance, he can arrest
                almost anybody, for example, for tax evasion regarding non-reporting of a $100 birthday gift as income. These are the tactics used in authoritarian states, and these tactics were his public campaign positions during the
                campaign.

                You can’t trust the Republican party to punish election fraud, it rewards it. It also spreads idiotic stories in the media about nonexistent kinds of election fraud, like voting twice, dead-people voting, etc. Ballot
                stuffing used to happen in the 1960s, but it is a much smaller effect, and can only tilt close elections. This election was not all that close, the discrepancies were enormous.

                mentions the exit poll discrepancies in the primary, which are inexcusable.

                I don’t know which state you live in, but you have three months to petition your state to do something about federal presence, to assure the safety of their citizens. I think it is reasonable to ask for a temporary NY
                quarantine of all FBI offices, all Homeland Security, all drone-fly-overs, all internal espionage, so that if it takes place in NY, a New York appointed official will be involved at all stages, and the public will be
                informed of all the internal documents, with any sensitive or private information redacted. Just temporarily, to guarantee the safety of New Yorkers.
            </p>
            <p>It would also be a good idea to require security clearance for state officials so involved, so that no excuse of classification will be used to prevent people from seeing the charges against people.</p>
            <p>
                Further, I think it would be good for New York State to issue a statement of non-compliance with Federal arrest of its local and state government officials. The state can also guarantee habeus corpus protection which have
                been gutted at the Federal level. Any Federal FBI or terrorism case should be cleared with a state office before being allowed to proceed, and all arrested people must be subject to a state controlled trial before being
                handed over to a Federal agency.

                We were one step away from fascism with Bush II, all it would take is one massive terror attack in DC, following a homeland security drill, for Trump to have an excuse to arrest all his political opponents and enshrine a
                permanent Republican majority, by simply inventing some more imaginary terrorists. I don’t give a shit about terrorists, I am afraid of Trump, not of foreign terrorists.
            </p>
            <p>
                These state measures can be relaxed at such a time when the Federal government is sane again, but I think they are good to keep around permanently, just in case. New York can’t rely on DC to protect it’s citizens, it needs
                to do it’s job by itself. Our state representatives are not beholden to anyone except their voters, and you can meet with them and ask them for help. Please do so before Jan 20.

                “Power” is not the one rigging the elections. Republican controlled states are. The discrepancies are all in states where the election is run by Republicans. The state of Virginia is the single exception in the south, and

                That’s what firms do today, because elections have been coming out wrong since 2004. There were no problems in exit polls in any previous years they were conducted. In 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, and 2000, the
                networks would simply call the election the moment the last polling place closed using the exit polls, and they never had to correct any announced result in any state, that is, except for Florida in 2000. You know the story
                in Florida, Kathleen Harris purged voters and threw out tens of thousands of votes, gave Bush a tiny win, and was rewarded with a congressional seat.
            </p>
            <p>
                You do have to adjust for total turnout, and the populations that turned out, but that’s an easy adjustment for any pollster, and you can do without official results, just using your samples, and turnout figures for
                districts (without having to adjust using official counts). The polls in the US no longer serve the purpose of checking the election, and this is simply because the elections are fraudulent.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s not a conspiracy, it’s done by individual party members in individual districts, and Republicans either simply turn a blind eye, or reward someone who does it with a post. They reward fraud with positions of power,
                especially large roll-purges of black voters. I’ve had it with a party that doesn’t give a shit about Democracy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The press does not like to report on this stuff, and it is dangerous and destabilizing to talk about it, but the fraud is more blatant this year, and the candidate that won is more dangerous and destabilizing than any
                uncomfortable truths.

                was something that needed to get fixed in Obama’s adminstration, but he wouldn’t be able to do it after Lieberman’s defection, he only had 2 months.

                You need to audit the Spanish election, then, unless the exit poll was informal. This “exit poll failure” phenomenon is entirely ridiculous, and the excuses for it are absurd. The exit poll difference has favored the
                Republicans in every election, in every district where there is a discrepancy. It’s not statistical error, or “shy voters” (as if that makes any sense with anonymous polls). They trotted this bullshit out in 2004, when Bush
                won Ohio after losing definitively in the poll, that election was less divided, and my own feeling from pre-election polls was that Democrats had it in the bag. In my own experience with American elections (before electronic
                voting was forcibly introduced by post-9/11 Republicans in 2002-2003) and Israeli elections, but also recent elections in Iraq, Ukraine, wherever, exit polls NEVER fail by any significant amount, and in any election with a
                margin of 1% or more, they are definitive. Their samples are approximately 100,000 voters, their accuracy is of the order of .1%. It’s the easiest circumstance to poll, and a discrepancy of even 1% is enough to check again.

                This is a fascist coup, America has fallen. My suspicion is that in three months, ostensibly to protest the election of Trump, weekly “terrorist attacks” will begin. ISIS is already “threatening Trump” in the press. Then the
                Muslims will get their ID badge, a few Democrats will protest and get arrested for “material support of terrorism”, the rest will get in line. The protesters and the Muslims will get “temporarily” interned (there are many
                black Muslims in America, so this will help to solve the “black problem” as well as the “muslim problem”), then “criminals” will be given show trials and summary executions, the immigrants will be deported, and those that
                harbor them arrested. It’s a 1933 style nightmare, the rhetoric is identical, and the surveillance network is much better. Except in this case Trump doesn’t make his ideology himself, his right-hand man is Bannon, and Bannon
                does the ideology. Bannon is a run-of-the-mill white supremacist.
            </p>
            <p>
                The press will do nothing, because newspapers will be sued by the president, using new libel laws, he has promised to do this, he can do this, and he has started by threatening to sue a Senator who opposed him. All the
                things I am saying are actual promises from Trump’s campaign. He was supposed to lose by a few votes, the votes for him were protest against Clinton (who deserved it). But when a party can change the counts by 6%, as it
                seems was the result in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, etc (the blue states Trump won), it is impossible to hold a fair election, as any legitimate protest by voters is converted to a win. Remember that in 1933, Hitler only
                won 40% of the German vote, he converted the plurality to a dictatorship using the “emergency” of the Reichstag fire, and arrested all the communists.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even if we get lucky, and none of this happens, Trump has appointed a white supremacist to office, and this guy is leading the Trump selection of people. He will turn the cities into wastelands, and his economic platform is
                batshit insane. There is nothing to do. Trump will get 80% margins in 2020, because there will be no opposition, they will all be sued or in prison.

                rest. The vote in red states is not counted correctly, with statistical certainty. This is a growing effort that started with a serendipitous event with Kathleen Harris in Florida, who was rewarded for her fraud with a
                congressional seat in a safe Republican district. It continued into 2004, and hasn’t stopped since. Obama was popular enough to overcome it, but this is unusual.

                I didn’t claim that the twin towers were destroyed by traditional demolition methods, only WTC 7 fell that way. The most plausible explanation for WTC 1 and 2 is that the steel at the towers center was melted at the joints
                using thermite, and the buildings just came down by themselves once there was no significant support left. That explains NIST’s model results for the time of collapse, which I did reproduce (in a few minutes) by calculating
                the time for fall starting at the location of the impact and slowed down only by the inertia of picking up new stationary floors. To have that weird kind of collapse like you see in the towers, you need to get rid of the
                stress in the central steel structure and do nothing else. That’s weird, because this collapse starts at the point of impact, not at the base.
            </p>
            <p>
                Building 7 is different, because it collapses at the base, and simultaneously, and at EXACTLY free fall, without even the inertial lag business. That means the supports are all cut at the same time, and that requires a
                traditional demolition. It’s a much easier case to analyse than the towers, and this is why truthers focus on it.

                The distance is illusion. The same internet that reveals uncomfortable truths about Shakespeare (where there is no political impact) also reveals uncomfortable truths about 9/11. It is a question about whether the
                un-peer-reviewed publicly generated information you find on random web-pages can be MORE reliable in some case than the stuff you read in official reports. In both cases of Marlowe/Shakespeare and for 9/11, the answer is a
                surprising yes.
            </p>
            <p>
                In both cases, the science supports the unpopular view, and in neither case is it much of a conspiracy. In the case of 9/11, the drills allow the drill-coordinator to pull of the sham without any significant conspirators,
                and in the case of Shakespeare, only Shakespeare and Marlowe and their patrons are guilty of using a front for a disgraced and exiled author. Neither requires suspension of disbelief in the laws of human organization.

                It’s not that I didn’t understand your gibberish, it’s that there’s no point to a detailed analysis of the foundations or the beams. It doesn’t matter how the beams were attached to each other, or to the foundation. The
                whole facade came straight down, at free-fall.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way to see that this is not a natural collapse is simply to observe that the supports “on the facade” at the left of the building collapsed at the same time as the supports “on the facade” at the right end, as I can see
                with my own eyes. If you examine cases of natural collapse, e.g. the delft building:

                <a title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bizr86N-4nc" href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dbizr86N-4nc%3A_qnkHXrkYq3YdjD8LFID_4S0MtY&amp;cuid=3213244" rel="nofollow noopener">

            </p>
            <p>
                a column fails, a part collapses, the rest of the building stays standing, and the collapse is asymmetrical and incomplete. In the case of the video, the left of the Delft buidling collapsed, the rest stayed up, as expected
                from localized failure.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s always the case when buildings have natural collapse, a column fails here, another there, and they fail at different times, and some don’t fail at all. The building becomes a hollowed out wreck, similar to what you
                see in postwar pictures of Germany.
            </p>
            <p>
                The heat expansion coefficient of steel is such that even for heating of the entire span of steel to 700 degrees (which is absurd, it’s like placing the whole building in a furnace), the steel would expand by some
                centimeters, or tens of centimeters. This leads to a noticible “sagging” of beams, as you can see in the steel-framed high-rise fire, because a few centimeters of extra length translates to some meters of bend in the beam.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your claim is that the thermal expansion pushed one column out of it’s seat, and then, like a domino, this column magically collapsed the next columns, from the inside out, until it reached the outer columns at PRECISELY AND
                EXACTLY THE SAME TIME to produce a completely symmetrical collapse. That’s preposterous, it would require a miracle of coincidence, and I don’t believe in miracles. This building was engineered to collapse.
            </p>

                I believe there was a real danger of a natural collapse, and to prevent the problems of a natural collapse, people triggered whatever demolition system they installed years or months earlier. If there would have been a
                natural collapse, it probably would have happened the way NIST says. But then only the area around the weak column would collapse, leaving a building with a hole in it, or else a section would collapse, or else a part would
                topple outward, or else the left half would collapse 2 seconds before the right, so that it would tilt. None of these are observed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I see you like to impress people with engineering terms. That’s very nice. You are not explaining the collapse, you are simply regurgitating horseshit. It is not reasonable for you to claim a natural collapse from the
                invisible inside out, when I see a symmetrical simultaneous collapse from the bottom up.
            </p>
            <p>
                NIST stopped the computer simulation after the failure of the first beam, so there is nothing to be gained from reading their report. If you would like to point to a simulation of the collapse of the building from a failure
                of the column, one which shows a magic domino effect where you get failure of the outer columns at exactly the same time, I will be glad to look at it, run it on my computer, and laugh at it. Until you have such a model (you
                never will), I will continue to scorn your nonsense.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not a truther because of this demolition, as I said, I don’t think it matters much one way or another. But because I think I know something about structures, I don’t accept your facile just-so-story. I want to know how
                the building collapsed for real, not in your fantasies, or those of NIST.

                The part about thermal expansion due to long-span floors is gibberish, thermal expansion is negligible stress compared to structural weakening, it just causes beam deformation. But, let’s suppose, just for argument’s sake,
                that the thermal expansion can stress a column somewhat, and suppose one of the support columns collapses, let’s imagine. It still requires a miraculous coincidence for two columns to fail at once, and an even more
                miraculous coincidence for three to fail, as they are not linked by the same beam. In building 7, all the supports gave way at once, ALL OF THEM.
            </p>
            <p>
                Likewise point 5 is gibberish, about the colums going through the station. It doesn’t matter where they were placed. There is no need to give fake abstruse comments about engineering, you clearly don’t understand the first
                thing about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only thing you need to know about the collapse is that it was simultaneous, meaning that the failure of the columns at the far left side of the building happened within a fraction of a second of the columns at the far
                right. That’s all the columns, however many there were, 12, 15, 17, I don’t know and I DON’T CARE. When all the columns fail at the same time, this is an engineered collapse. In natural collapses, the columns fail one by
                one, or, sometimes, rarely, when there is a coincidence, in groups of two. They don’t fail all at the same time, everywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your previous points are therefore also gibberish. The firefighting efforts are unimportant, as is the fire itself. The sounds the building made was unimportant. The damage from debris was unimportant. When the collapse
                happened, all the supports gave way at the same time, and this means it was explosively demolished. With timers. It’s not easy to get a building to collapse like that.
            </p>
            <p>
                The natural collapse that day was building 6. I suggest you take a look at that, to see what a natural collapse looks like. Your methods of propaganda are obvious and worthless. You should give it up, and start doing
                propaganda for the good guys.

                Whatever you say. The building collapsed by demolition, as is obvious. It is also obvious that WTC 1 and 2 collapsed by demolition, but there, it is less obvious, because the supports were gradually disconnected by thermite,
                so the building collapsed from the weak spot down, not as WTC 7 collapsed, from the bottom.
            </p>
            <p>
                Neither of these collapses are the strongest case for an inside job, since demolition by itself does not require that the whole thing was a sham. Maybe dangerous highrises are all secretly rigged to go down in emergency? I
                don’t know. Considering what happened at WTC in 1994, it wouldn’t be a huge surprise, and it would just be criminal negligence to bring them down on 9/11, not a false flag.
            </p>
            <p>
                No. The real smoking-gun evidence for an inside job is the simultaneous drills which were occuring on the morning of 9/11. These drills simulated hijackings, messed with air-traffic control computers, and pretended to fly
                airplanes into buildings. Regardless of demolition, these drills demonstrate that this was an inside job. The demolition itself happened as I said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your use of technical words is gibberish. The collapse of WTC 7 was simultaneous, therefore all the columns had to collapse simultaneously. That can’t happen by fire, it requires explosives. Nothing at all can happen to that
                building by fire, and structural weakness leads to a collapse that looks like WTC 6. But this as I said is not the “strongest case”, as demolitions are not the main proof. The drills are.

                Solzhenitsyn is a stupid propagandist. The “gulags” closed under Khruschev. The later Soviet Union’s human rights violations were placing dissidents in mental institutions and drugging them, preventing mobility, censoring
                media, and so on. But there were no real camps anymore. Khruschev was a fan of “A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich”, as was I, but this was the last time Solzhenitsyn told anything resembling the truth.

                Yeah, that’s about right. The notion of God here is an abstract disembodied “desire” which is constructed from the self-consistency of the universal ethics. This God is “one”, because the ethics is universal. This God is
                “omniscient” by definition, because in order to construct a universal system of perfect ethical decision-making, you need to know every nitpicky detail about everybody. The omniscience is not necessarily omniscience of
                future events, by the way, it could be or not without changing the ethics, because God’s knowledge of the future doesn’t change the ethical decisions WE must make, when WE are ignorant of this future. So aren’t required to
                say “God knows the future”, but you could say that if you wanted to, as some Protestants do, it doesn’t change anything practical. The two positions are only superficially different, they are equivalent in logical
                positivism. God is “omnipotent” in the sense that whatever God wants will get done when people get around to doing what they should, which they will eventually get around to doing (and they better hurry up!). That’s about
                it, all the rest is exegesis with fanciful storytelling. This concept is found in Hinduism also, in the Brahma idea and monotheistic ethics, which is likely either originally Hindu, or an offshoot of Hinduism (Hinduism is
                still ethically monotheistic, despite the superficial polytheism of many manifestations and visual representations— this is a point made by many religious Hindus who get annoyed with Muslims or Christians claiming the
                religion is less sophisticated than theirs).
            </p>
            <p>
                The way one recieves “revelations” is by your head extrapolating the will of God using your own experiences and intuitions, in an attempt to put them together into a consistent universal ethics. Your brain does this
                automatically, but it doesn’t always do it right. If you tune in to this system with self-awareness, it can sound like a person “talking” to you from outside, about ethics. You can receive what appear to you to be
                revelations about immoral things because, unlike God, you are NOT omniscient, and have imperfect knowledge of absolute ethics, even in cases where your intuition is firm.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Muslim slavery codes are absurd, of course, like the Jewish slavery codes, but both were written at a time when much worse practices existed, which might explain why it is that otherwise kind and inspired people were led
                to consider them ethically superior. That’s not to justify them, but to explain that the Koran was doing ethical reform the same way the Christians and Jews did earlier. You can argue that the Muslims didn’t go as far as the
                rest in 600AD, but the argument is really stupid now that we are out of the middle ages and we have advanced so far over all these systems. The modern “Jihadist” nonsense is not Islamic in any modern sense of the religion,
                it is barbaric nonsense resurrected by secular people to gain power and money from foreign donors, and you can’t say it belongs to religion really, it belongs to pure secular politics.
            </p>
            <p>The way to know that God is NOT ok with stuff like that is just the same way you come to understand that this stuff is immoral, as “being immoral” and “being against the will of God” is tautologically the same thing.</p>
            <p>
                One reason people reject religion is because it comes with a lot of nonsense anti-science stuff. I also reject this aspect. But the main idea is valid, and needs to be preserved. This is just the statement that the perfect
                ethics can and must be identified with the disembodied will of a unified perfectly omniscient being. You can’t construct this abstract will perfectly in your meditation and cogitation, or having intuitive flashes
                (revelations), but you can do better with time, individually and collectively, and achieve a certain confidence that some things, like sexual slavery, or the caste-system, are absolutely completely unethical, while other
                things, like Hindu drawings of Ganesh, or Krishna Bhajans, are holy and beautiful. Most of the time, like regarding bigamy or weird sex, you just have no clear idea, and you have to not be so dogmatic, because we’re all
                muddling through fog.

                What could you possibly mean about no advancement regarding slavery? Slavery in Christendom was abolished in the 7th century, reintroduced in the 11th century, became widespread in the colonial era, and reabolished in the
                19th century, in large part due to the contributions of religious Christians. It was reintroduced by the Nazis, and you know how that turned out.

                Your examples are not the most brutal in Leviticus, I could show you much worse. In Leviticus 27, you can see that slaves could be pawned to the priesthood as collateral for a loan, and could be killed if the loan was not
                repayed. This is not obvious in most translations, the text is opaque in Hebrew. I did a translation myself found here:

                Paul DOES ask Philemon to consider Onesimus’s debts as charged to him in full. That’s the point. There is no money changing hands, he is saying the slave debt is as nothing compared to the soul-debt. That’s the point of the
                epistle, and it is 10 thousand times more clear about the goal of ending slavery than any Jewish law, which, in my opinion, is why Christianity is more popular than Judaism today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding Paul’s finances, he is recieving payments from the Church, probably like a salary. The Church had finances, and provided finacial relief and aid to members who were struggling. There are some verses which are
                mystifying regarding finances which become clearer when one understands this, like Jesus saying “He who shall not work, neither shall he eat”, and a sentiment along the lines of “it is better to give your last penny to the
                church than to use it to buy bread”.

                I know that Christians would disagree with me about the point of Christianity. I think Karl Marx would agree, but I am not sure, I have not read this in Marx. This is a hypothesis regarding the social forces that drove the
                acceptance of Christianity (and also Judaism to a lesser extent) in Rome. These religions had injunctions which prevented stratification of society along socio-economic lines.

                I am not saying this to argue that the Bible is written by supernatural forces, or that it is inerrant. I am trying to explain that there is a certain transcendent truth which it is trying to explain, that I think is more
                easily explained using modern game theoretic ideas, like superrational decision making.

                Wow!!! Thanks for finding it! I did learn it in grade 7 or so, and forgot the exact passage. I think that the most parsimonious assumption is to take it at face value, that it is not remarkable that the boy can read. That’s
                consistent with the historical evidence of the literacy of otherwise random Jews, like Josephus, or Paul, or Peter (these didn’t start off as high-up people). The same unremarkable literacy is assumed when you hear about
                random citizen Jews nitpicking over the meanings of obscure verses. This is not the case for random citizen Christians. The early Christian Church is underdocumented, because it is a largely illiterate society, and this is
                one of Carrier’s major points regarding the fidelity of the Gospel narratives to history.
            </p>
            <p>I don’t know the standard consensus among historians regarding ancient Hebrew literacy, but I think I am stating a mainstream position when I say it was universal. But again, I didn’t read secondary sources for this.</p>

            <p>I don’t think Biblical slavery is a good thing, it’s terrible. I don’t think the Bible is inerrant or infallible. I am trying to explain the main point of the text.</p>
            <p>
                I don’t use secondary sources. Everything I write is 100% original, although in this case, I am sure that I am not the first to say these things. I read parts of the OT in Hebrew (I had to, in grade school), and the entire
                NT in English translation on my own time. For 6th and 7th century abolition of Christian slavery, I just did some googling around, the edicts are well known. The “7 years” is just a rough number, I don’t care about the
                minutiae of Biblical law. The reference for universal literacy is in Kings somewhere (I learned it in grade school, I don’t remember specifically), where a peasant boy is offhand asked to take down a message to some
                character or other. The implicit presumption is that the peasant boy can read and write. The reciting of the law is not a substitute for literacy, it is a formalized way of ensuring it, by requiring reading of a standard
                text as a process of socialization. It is clear that Peter and Paul are literate, as are poor essenes in the desert, etc, while by contrast almost all the gentile members of the early church are illiterate. The high rate of
                Jewish literacy is tied to the injunction to learn to read the texts, although, of course, today universal literacy is not something unusual.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Biblical injunctions on slavery are the start of a very slow process of reform, whose extremely long-term goal to get rid of the institution step by step. The observation that ancient Hebrews didn’t have chattel slaves
                follows from the structure of the law, I didn’t read it in a book, I noticed myself after reading Exodus. The law only recognizes slavery as a manner of paying off debts for a limited time, or else a voluntary submission, or
                for an enslaved person who has married a member of the household. While I don’t know anyone who mentions it specifically in the literature other than me just now (although I am sure I am not the first to notice), under these
                limitations, you can’t have a stable hereditary slave caste, everyone is effectively free, aside from those who voluntarily choose it. This does not apply to women, who were treated as property.
            </p>
            <p>
                Slavery is a very difficult thing to get rid of, as it is self-reinforcing, evolutionarily stable, and is viewed as a positive good by slave-owners and it embeds itself in the very foundations of society, much the same way
                that people today view capitalism as a positive good. Imagine, for an analogy, trying to get rid of the capitalists in modern society. That’s what it means to get rid of slaveowners. In the ancient world. Common wisdom held
                that slavery was essential for society. The Christian reforms gradually got rid of slavery, and it wasn’t all rosy, a lot of industries simply vanished as they couldn’t exist without slaves. The whole ancient way of life
                vanished.

                Philemon didn’t die without heirs, Onesimus becomes Bishop because he is freed by Philemon. You are misunderstanding Paul when he says “Charge the debts to my account.” This is not a bank account he is talking about, nor is
                he talking about paying literal money for literal debts (not like Paul could pay any debts anyway, he wasn’t so wealthy). He is talking about paying down Onesimus’s slave debt with purely spiritual currency, the value of
                which is Philemon’s soul.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Onesimus who was Bishop of Antioch (or whatever city) is certainly the same runaway slave fellow, in tradition, and in plain understanding. You don’t understand the Epistle, because you don’t understand the point of
                Christianity. It is creating a new society in which slavery becomes impossible. Much like Marxists try to create a society in which wage-labor becomes impossible.

                You are confusing the form of the Jewish laws with their intended effect. If you read the text of the law, it is stupid and barbaric, obviously, as all written ancient laws are. But the point of the Jewish law is that it is
                not fixed secular law, but religious law, which means that it was designed to be interpreted by people with a teleological goal which is something like a communist utopia. Like modern Marxism-Leninism, it came with a lot of
                restrictions on individual liberty.

            <p>
                The family exception was not a way to avoid releasing slaves, it wouldn’t work anyway, as the slave would simply refuse to marry until the seven years were up. The point of this is to keep families which are dependent on the
                owner for subsistence together. The Jewish children of such unions would be free. The point of this “temporary regulated slavery” business is that it has the EFFECT of eliminating generational slavery, replacing it with a
                system of 7-year periods of indentured labor, where you pay off a debt, and then do something else. This release from debt over seven years is preserved in modern law in the periodic writing off of debt in all modern
                countries. Using these roundabout methods, the Jews successfully rid their society of the pestilence of ancient slavery, and the Christians did the exact same thing. The Jews also achieved universal literacy in ancient
                times, as attested by certain passages which don’t make sense unless it was expected that everyone could read and write.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Christians had a debate regarding the elimination of slavery in the 3rd-6th, and there were several proposals during this period. One of them was to copy the Jews and have temporary slavery, and this was rejected.
                Instead it became an outright ban sometime in the 6th or 7th century, which is much better (by that point, of course, Jews also did not own slaves). This is the main social transformation from ancient economics to medieval
                economics, and it’s why Christmas is celebrated all over Europe like a Juneteenth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your misreading of the Epistle to Philemon is the usual one for both ancient and modern slaveholders. The Epistle is grappling with a serious problem— a Christian slave has run away from a Christian slaveowner. The letter is
                extraordinary, because it says to Philemon’s slave, Onesimus, “Go back to your master”. It says to Philemon, the master, “accept him back, but you are no longer to view him as a slave, but as an equal.” Then Paul says that
                Philemon must consider the debt of Onesimus in relation to the debt of Philemon to Paul, for saving his soul. Paul asks him to consider the relation of these debts, and asks him to do the right thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Philemon accepts Onesimus back, and at some point, releases him from slavery. The free Onesimus becomes a Bishop of some large city (I think Antioch). This was the Paul method of dealing with slavery— assert that it is
                wrong, assert that it is the law, demand that you obey the law as a slave, but demand that the Christian master recognize the evil and release the slave.
            </p>

                The hewing to the letter of the law made Christianity less subversive than Spartacus. But the insistence on moral truth made it both more subversive and more successful. Modern anti-slavery movements point to the Epistle to
                Philemon as a emancipatory document (which it is), but it is a work of genius, in that it is written in such a way that a non-religious person will see it as justifying slavery. It is a remarkable document, the only one of
                its kind. It is doubly remarkable that it was canonized at a time when slavery was still around.

                You are missing the main point of monotheistic religions. The monotheistic religions introduce a notion of morality which goes BEYOND the simple requirement of producing a social order which is stable and self-propagating.
                The requirement of stability is the endpoint of the Roman Empire. They had ethics, for sure, but it wasn’t monotheistic ethics, so it was wrong from the point of view of any future time, especially so from our point of view
                two thousand years later, when the monotheistic idea is so deeply embedded.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Roman empire, you had a strict caste system, with slaves, landowners, free-merchants, powerful imperial appointees, senators, military folks, and so on. Each caste was rigidly determined and nearly strictly
                hereditary. There was nothing wrong with this from a social or evolutionary perspective, but from a monotheistic perspective it was abominable.
            </p>
            <p>
                What it meant was that you had people tortured in arenas for entertainment, women sold and raped, other slaves who were forced into a life of illiteracy and drudgery and thrown to fend for themselves when their productive
                labor period was over, slaves who toiled in mines and fields, and others who lived off the labor of these slaves. This ancient economic system was extremely stable, it was evolutionarily productive, the Roman economy was
                growing until Christianity arose, and very self-reinforcing. The point of monotheistic ethics is to shatter these stable but abhorrent fixed points and move to a better equilibrium, and to do so, you can’t rely on logic or
                evolution, you must be guided by a transcendent idea of what it means to be “better”. This is what monotheism is all about. Notice that I never said anything about omnipotent beings.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the case of Judaism, this was achieved by a series of accumulating gradual reforms, which on their own seem arbitrary and unrelated but together transform ancient society to something much different. There was a law that
                required you to circumcise all foreign slaves, another law that required Jewish slaves to be manumitted every seven years, another law which required property to be restored to its original owners every 49 or 50 years (the
                way the Jubilee worked is debated). There was a labor law requiring a day of rest, strictly enforced, a law requiring the sharing of the Passover lamb with strangers and wanderers (meaning non-Jews). There was a requirement
                of reading and writing to be able to read and understand these laws, there was abolition of temple prostitution, and the introduction of a slave-narrative of the exodus, which required all Jews to picture themselves as
                slaves. Taken together, these laws essentially ended chattel slavery in Judea, gradually, as slaves converted to Judaism (it was easy as they are circumcized), and were manumitted.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Christian transformation is based on personal revelation, through Jesus, and takes this idea further, into an open-ended project of continual transformation, based on the insights one gains through the holy spirit (this
                is also true in Judaism, but it is disguised, as when you change something, you are supposed to pretend it was always this way in the holy book, leading to more and more tortured interpretation of the texts over time).
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Christian method, you don’t demand manumittence every seven years, rather there is an even stricter expectation, which is not enforced by any law: you just expect the Christian slaveholder to release their slaves
                voluntarily! On their own schedule, but to do it. This is explained in the Epistle to Philemon. There is a marked transformation of the Roman economy in the Christianization period, which is likely a serious economic
                decline, and I personally believe this is caused by the gradual end of slavery. Does this decline mean that Europe was going backwards? Not exactly. Sure, it was harder to run the mines and make those sculptures. But you
                didn’t have to be a slave anymore. Only the monotheistic ethics allows you to make such a tradeoff calculation, and do it right.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sixth century European edicts made this an explicit— you were not allowed as a Christian to own Christian slaves at all. Jews also abolished slavery, so the reintroduction of slavery in the late middle ages was through
                captured Muslims.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point of the revelation is to get you to understand that there is a large unique mind which tells you what is right and what is wrong, that you can access this mind both personally and through collective religious
                discussion and congregation, and that while your knowledge is never perfect, the ideal ethics is NOT something that the social order will naturally converge on without a lot of hard work convincing people to accept the
                transcendent insights. This is why people make up fairy-tales about impossible events and force people to repeat them, to make sure that they are forced to accept the NON fairy-tale of the actual process of producing better
                ethics. It should be possible to do this without this kind of lying when people are universally literate and have an internet.

                Akin’s arguments simply show that he didn’t read Carrier’s book. The emergence of Christianity is completely explained through revelation. The “brother of Christ” is simply a term for non-apostolic Christians, while the
                relation of Peter to Jesus is similar to that of Paul. The founding human figure of Christianity is Peter, and the “untimely born” one is Paul, who received the revelation late. The mythicist position is consistent with the
                evidence, while the standard story is not.

                Personally, I think that I am a full believer, except perhaps not in the exact same way you are, as I don’t believe any scientifically impossible material events ever happened, nor do I think anyone needs to believe such
                things to fully understand religion. In fact, I think such a belief in supernatural nonsense is detrimental. Perhaps if you could read my mind, you would conclude I am still an atheist because of this, I don’t know, but I do
                know you’d be wrong. Experience of spiritual communication with Jesus is simply not sufficient evidence for changing anyone’s beliefs about what happens in the material world. It is, however, a good start to changing your
                beliefs about the structure of the Platonic world of ideas, especially ethics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Partly due to a personal experience, partly due to reasoning about its interpretation, I ended up accepting that Christian theology is a true religious system (appropriately interpreted, and there are other true religious
                systems also). But at no point did this experience suddenly compel me (or even suggest to me) to believe in materially impossible events. At one point during this revelation, I did ask myself “is it reasonable to lie about
                material events to get people to understand this revelation better?”, but introspection said “heck no!” At least for me, the constant claims of impossible material events were the main barrier for me to understand this
                revelation business, and since there is no requirement to believe in nonsense that comes from this experience, why would I make it harder for other people who are scientific literate? Knowing science doesn’t change the
                spiritual message one bit, one way or the other. It just gets you to be less obtuse about the stories you tell people to get them to understand it also.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a matter of fact, because I found it so easy to do, as I said, at no point was I even TEMPTED to change anything about my understanding of the material world, I don’t believe that anyone could possibly have any difficulty
                either. There was nothing in the experience of communicating with Jesus which demands that I believe that a material human body rose from the dead. The communication only was about ethical and aesthetic things, relations of
                people and ideas, it was not about history or cosmology, or anything like that. In fact, whenever I tried to reason about history and cosmology or mathematics, the experience of communicating with God just went away, and I
                found myself alone again.

                These are valid or not according to whether they are ethically compatible with other revelations. It’s a limiting self-consistency in the infinite future. There is no limit on the different types or numbers of mutually
                compatible revelations, only that they reveal a convergent system of superrational ethics eventually, which is essentially unique. There is no serious contradiction between, say, Buddhist revelation and Christian revelation
                if you are careful to stay logically-positivist about the meaning of the revelations and not interpret these things in historical or material terms. That’s why spiritual resurrection is just better theology than material
                resurrection.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ethical compatibility is essential, as it is the distinction between the gods people reject today and those that survive. Hinduism is compatible with monotheistic ethics (it was probably the original source of monotheism
                historically), so it continues. Other religions, like those that demanded child sacrifice or widow-burning, were deprecated and died, or else evolved to remove the parts which were ethically shown to be false by other
                insights and experiences, like (some) Christianity jettisoned its anti-gay and anti-women teachings recently.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point of Carrier’s view of the resurrection is that it is completely compatible with the one other monotheistic faith in the region around at the time, which was Judaism. In standard Christianity, Jesus being both a
                historical human and a spiritual deity makes for a serious incompatibility with Judaism, which leads Jews to see Christianity as a completely impossible belief system and completely unrelated to Judaism, which it really
                isn’t and wasn’t.

                The concept of “freedom of contract” is ridiculous. The government enforces the contract, not you, so the government sets the terms. For example, I can’t sell myself into slavery. Freedom of contract is really the freedom to
                ensure that the government will enforce your long term trade agreements, and the government can do that without simultaneously enforcing the absurd legislation-as-contract that businesses today impose on consumers and labor.

            <p>
                Freedom of exchange only leads to concentrations of money if you choose to not construct the tax system to naturally distribute capital broadly. That’s a social choice. If you structure the tax system to distribute power
                broadly, for example, by taxing business at a rate determined by the degree of distributed ownership, you will produce widespread distribution of power, as businesses restructure to maximize profits. If a company is taxed
                more when ownership is concentrated in a few than when it is distributed to many, it will choose to distribute ownership spontaneously. There is nothing immutable about the social relations produced by free exchange, they
                are determined by the decisions made about the taxation structure and the social structure. They seem immutable to a conservative, because a conservative is only concerned with preserving currently existing power structures,
                because of their position in the heirarchy and their limited brain.

                I agree with nearly all of what you say, except that what you describe Paul believing in is simply not what the term “historical Jesus” means. A historical Jesus is not just a Jesus that becomes embodied in flesh and lives
                as a man and gets crucified, that’s universal to Christianity. A historical Jesus means that Jesus is a very specific man, whose life and history in some way roughly matches the historical sounding parts of the gospels.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is what Paul never claims in any authentic surviving text. What he tells you is that Jesus is a celestial figure who acquired a body of Davidian stock, suffered and was crucified while inhabiting this body, and returned
                from the dead to spread the gospel. But Paul is not specific that this embodied Jesus was a personal friend of Peter’s, nor that he had a brother named James, nor that he had a mother named Mary. He doesn’t claim to have met
                any person who knew Jesus in any unambiguous way. Most significantly, he doesn’t base any of the theology on claims of firsthand experience with the historical person. Jesus’s embodied experience is an abstraction, a source
                of theological inspiration, not a memory of a historical event.
            </p>
            <p>
                There simply is no historical person there. The embodiment of Jesus is not in a specific person, nor does it have to be. It is sufficient for Christianity that the embodiment took place, when and where is not so important.
                It could have been on Earth, it could have been in “outer space” (as Carrier claims), it could have been anonymous, and Jesus did not need to be a famous preacher, he could have been any innocent person crucified by Romans.
                The details simply don’t matter, they are added later as the dogmatic story become solidified around the core theological points.

                literal-headed historical story to justify the beliefs of the original gang, by stages. The process is described well in Carrier’s book, and it is, despite superficial impressions, much more parsimonious than the standard

                Paul believed Jesus was born of woman, as an embodiment of a celestial figure, from the seed of David, whose role was to get crucified to end temple sacrifice. Being flesh-and-blood, born of woman, is what allows him to be
                both celestial and messiah at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paul simply doesn’t associate Jesus with any specific historical person. He only knows the celestial Jesus, and the only purpose of the flesh incarnation is to provide messiah and atonement sacrifice. As far as Paul is
                concerned, even JESUS wouldn’t have to know who he was on Earth so as to make the theology work. He wouldn’t have to be named Jesus. He could be some random crucified person. Just as long as after the crucifiction, the
                celestial Jesus resurrects and announces the good news to the apostles, the theology is complete. There is no historical narrative attached to the theology.

                The comparison to John Frum is appropriate, because the early Church was an illiterate society. Only the Jews were literate, as universal literacy is an essential part of Jewish religion. Other than Paul, there were

                got this point wrong, therefore this completely unrelated point is also wrong”. Einstein made similar mistakes, for instance, his completely bogus superconductivity paper in 1917, or “black holes can’t form” from 1938.
                Einstein also wrongly thought that quantum effects can emerge from GR. He didn’t get everything right. Research requires bold ideas and patient review, and that demands the acceptance that you will be wrong sometimes, but
                also demands that you don’t give up until your opponents demonstrate it conclusively. The ego is good, it allows you to continue when the political consensus is against you.

            <p>
                The experts of the 1950s agreed with Carrier that the Big Bang was probably wrong, and some form of steady state was right, for essentially similar anti-theological reasons. This, despite the overwhelming evidence from Big
                Bang Nucleosynthesis in Gamow’s papers from the 1940s. Sometimes the consensus of experts is totally busted, and there is no recipe to tell you when. You need to do a painstaking review.

            <p>
                Unlike the Big Bang, where we have nuclear abundance data and microwave background, regarding the Jerusalem church, there is no evidence. There are NO DOCUMENTS! Nothing. It’s all gone. There’s nothing I can see which
                support the claim that they viewed Jesus as a human first. I would appreciate it if you could list the original sources that Vermes uses to support his assertion, I didn’t read his book.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is simply no evidence from the Jerusalem church. We don’t know what they thought, and the stuff in the NT which describes their doctrine, and the stuff in the Talmud, are both strongly compatible with Carrier’s
                position.
            </p>
            <p>
                The “argument from personal incredulity” only goes so far— it is possible that the Jerusalem church was following the more ancient human Jesus from the 1st century BC, and Paul introduced the divine-figure Jesus, but then,
                how did they reconcile their theology? How is it consistent with the reports of the mass visions of the risen Christ in the pentacost? These things are consistent with Carrier’s version.
            </p>
            <p>
                These historical reviews require judgement. I don’t think this debate has any relevance to the atheism debate— it’s not about atheism at all. This is about scholarly bunk. There are cases where you have a gigantic field
                founded entirely on bunk, like Freudian psychoanalysis or Phlogiston theory, or Aristotelian physics. It seems that “Historical Jesus research” is the same sort of thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think I have seen every single original document in this case, and in my own judgement, Carrier’s position is the most logically sound position. You can make more speculative scenarios with a historical Jesus figure, but
                they would be pure speculation, and the historical figure would have no relation at all to the stories in the Gospels, which would have to get composed as Carrier explains they were.

                Paul considered Jesus a person, but a sort of celestial person, who was crucified to end temple sacrifice, not as a specific historical figure. The earliest Church figures thought of Jesus the same way, and didn’t specify
                who he was historically, but after Paul died, when the Gospel of Mark came out to proselyze, in around 70AD or so, the historical interpretation started becoming dominant.
            </p>
            <p>Mark was most likely written as pure allegory, but it could marginally be read as history, it has a structure like the passion plays of Romulus common in Rome. You could even act it out and stage it to get converts.</p>
            <p>
                It’s a success, so then the competing Gospels got written, first Matthew, to give a more Jewish character to the gospel, and to write a better allegory (and fix the ending of Mark). Then, due to the growth of the Church,
                most new members just accepted it as a history, by taking it too literally.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the time the Gospels of Luke and John were composed some decades later, the idea that Jesus was a historical person was firmly a majority opinion, and since it does no harm to the essential theological points, it doesn’t
                matter to the Church leaders what people believe about history. For all they know, the stories are authentic, the authenticity is not a driver of the narrative, just it’s efficacy in gaining converts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The same process happened again with Cargo Cults, as Carrier documents extensively, where a fictitious person was turned into a historical character with a consistent narrative over one generation of worship. It’s not only
                possible, it’s by far the most likely origin story for the gospels.

                James is not the “brother of Jesus”. This is another old saw that Carrier puts to rest for good. There is no solid evidence that James is a flesh-and-blood relative of a historical Jesus, the references to “brother of
                Christ” is just as easily read as a reference to a “brother in Christ”, as Carrier does. James is just the most notable of the early non-apostle Christians. It is also not clear to me that he ever led the Church, he was just
                martyred at some point, that’s all I know, but perhaps he did lead the Jerusalem Church at one time, I don’t know. It’s not that important I think.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your fundamental postulate is that the divine status of Jesus was actually resisted by the Jerusalem branch. This is problematic, it is almost certainly not true, as we know that Paul’s view of Jesus is as a divine figure,
                perhaps not co-equal to God, but certainly like a high angel. This is ALSO the point of view expressed in Peter I, and it is a severe stretch of the documents to believe that the Jerusalem Church and the Rome Church could
                disagree on something so fundamental and still call themselves member of the same religion. They disagreed on the role of Jewish dietary laws, on Jewish law in general, and on the relative weight one should place on the
                teachings of Jesus vs. the OT, but that’s expected. They can’t reasonably disagree fundamentally on what Jesus is.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the nice things about Carrier is that after accepting his position, you can view Peter I as authentic, as Church history suggests, and only Peter II as inauthentic, as textual analysis reveals. This is not something
                Carrier says explicitly (he mentions Peter I a lot, and I’m sure he knows this, he just doesn’t emphasize this as a selling point), but it is something I noticed after reading his book and rereading Peter I. I believe now
                that Peter I is probably authentic.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem with this hypothesis is that it is a claim based on pure speculation, just to resolve the theological mystery in the rise of Christianity. There are no sources which can support your claim, the only possibly
                authentic document we have from the Jerusalem church is the first Epistle of Peter, the rest is hearsay or reported via Paul, and in the stuff reported by Paul, there is no dispute regarding the role of Jesus or the figure
                of Jesus in the path to salvation, or the divine status of Jesus (although not necessarily co-equal with God, as Jesus is later).
            </p>
            <p>
                The doctrine of the Jerusalem Church is also independently attested to in the Talmud, extremely indirectly, where it is mentioned that there is a sect of Jews who worship Jesus with a different historical figure attached
                than the usual one. These Christians follow Jewish law, and are very likely the last 3rd or 4th century remnants of the now extinct Jerusalem church, and this attestation is pretty much the only purely independent evidence
                for the very existence of the Jerusalem Church! So you should take what the Talmud says seriously, you have no other source. They do not seem to differ much from other Christians regarding the role of Jesus, they seem to
                consider themselves Christians just as much as Pauline Christians.
            </p>
            <p>
                The postulate that Carrier gives, that Jesus was constructed from textual interpretation, without a clear historical precedent, is further muddied by the fact that later historical figures can add their say to the Gospels,
                but in a composite manner. So there is a martyrdom of James recorded somewhere, where James says “forgive them, for they know not what they do” while being stoned, and this ends up being placed in Jesus’ mouth. LIkewise for
                teachings of John the Baptist, and perhaps the legends of other documented figure, like the crazy guy who cut some cloth in the temple right before the destruction, saying “The end is nigh!” which is reported in Josephus.
            </p>
            <p>
                The creation of a false historical narrative is something that is easier to spot than it looks, you just keep looking at the sources, and trying to figure out what is myth, and what is history. In the case of Jesus, the end
                tally is 100% myth, with a little bit of composite history of various figures.
            </p>
            <p>
                In that case, the figure of Jesus is divine right from the start, although not initially coequal with God, as the trinity makes it out to be. It is possible for the Jerusalem church to oppose making Jesus a co-equal figure
                with God, but I do not accept that it is possible for them to reject the divine nature of Jesus and be Christians, or be compatible with the known theology of Paul. I would have to see the evidence. I did not read “Christian
                Beginnings”, but such works are usually marred by following traditional scholarly assumptions, and producing the weighted average of various opinions. I prefer someone like Carrier who goes back to the original sources, and
                does a rigorous analysis of what we can know and what we can’t.

                The rise of Christianity is not well explained by a historical Jesus. It is theologically next to impossible to imagine Jews deifying a real person, it is contrary to all Jewish teaching. On the other hand, it is very
                sensible to have Jews historcizing a celestial figure. The proper history links the two religions together in a continuous line of evolution, and is much more plausible than the standard story, which frankly is bizarre.

                The problem with this hypothesis is that there is a much more plausible explanation for the rise of Christianity which is simpler and more consistent with the data: some Jews decided to end temple sacrifice because the
                temple was corrupt. Now, all Jews decided to do this after the destruction of the temple, but THESE Jews had foresight, and decided to do this before. The only way to end temple sacrifice is by an uber-sacrifice which makes
                sacrificial redemption unnecessary, and therefore they are looking around in scripture for what that could be. A proper reading of Isiah 53 provides the suffering servant, and the Psalms describe something like a
                crucifiction, so they decide that a heavenly Jesus, the heavenly high priest, incarnated in the flesh, got himself crucified, and then resurrected to let everyone know the good news, that the end times have arrived, and
                temple sacrifice is no longer necessary. The historical story got tacked on later, when the destruction of the temple showed that the Christians were actually prescient.

            <p>
                Carrier’s argument is based on the fact that Paul never references Jesus as a person that anyone knows, but as a figure whose sacrifice ends temple sacrifice. He makes no mention of a historical Jesus, and this is the
                original observation on which mythicism is based. It is sufficient evidence by itself to give the hypothesis a fair hearing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paul simply doesn’t speak about Jesus as a historical person. He speaks about Jesus as a figure in the celestial realm who was incarnated in a body and sacrificed. This doesn’t mean that Paul knew anyone who knew the
                embodied Jesus, it doesn’t mean that Paul is reporting historical events, his main thesis is that one must communicate with the RISEN Jesus to understand Christianity. This is what people did, and then the rest follows,
                including the unintentional fabrication of historical records to place Jesus in history. The reason I say unintentional is because the earliest gospel, Mark, does not only have a historicist reading, but it can be read as
                allegory, which Carrier notes, and only by the time of the latest gospels, Luke and John, do we have historicism established as dogma as opposed to allegory.

                This is not about “there is a god” or “there is no god”, it is about history of religion. Unfortunately the scholarship in this field is exceedingly biased by groupthink and delusion, and one must counter it by redoing

                The “brother of Jesus” is a “brother of Christ”, which is really “brother in Christ”, as Carrier explains, and simply means that James was a non-apostle Christian. That’s all. It was later reinterpreted to mean that he was
                literally the brother of Jesus, which is not historically accurate. Carrier’s reading is more defensible in context.

                I agree with your statements, but not the conclusion. The point of the Targum is not that the folks who wrote it were Christians, and expected the messiah to suffer, it is simply that the figure in Isaiah 53 was interpreted
                as the messiah. That makes it completely reasonable to find Jews who interpreted Isiah 53 more straightforwardly than the Targum’s torturous rereading, and just went ahead and considered it a straightforward prophecy of
                Jesus.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a very weak piece of evidence by itself— Carrier isn’t saying “The Targum proves that Jews expected the messiah to suffer”, what he is saying is that the Targum makes it clear that Isaiah 53 is talking about the
                messiah, and given that, the probability that Jews would consider a suffering messiah is not small, so the argument that it is impossible to have a suffering messiah is neutralized. It is not at all impossible, it is in fact
                likely that some Jews read Isaiah 53 that way. How likely, you can quibble, but I think it’s likely enough to not affect Carrier’s conclusion.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point is that the probability-talk makes it clear why he is bringing up the Targum. It’s a glancing blow against the argument “no Jews would come up with a suffering messiah unless they actually knew a messiah person who
                suffered”. That argument is not right, as a simple reading of Isaiah 53, and the context of the figure being the messiah (from the Targum) shows. That the Targum doesn’t go that way doesn’t change the probabilities all that
                much, it still leaves it pretty likely that there were very likely some Jews back then who read it the way modern Christians read it today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding Paul, I agree with your statements about Paul’s philosophy, and I suspect Carrier agrees with your statements also. I just don’t see why they are relevant to historicity— all that Paul needed to believe is that
                Jesus, the divine celestial high-priest angel-like figure, decended from heaven to get a body of flesh that was then crucified, so as to restore God, etc, etc, he didn’t need Jesus to be a particular historical person, nor
                did he need that person to be a friend of his colleague Peter. The less historicity the better.
            </p>
            <p>
                Carrier further insists, with some specificity, that the crucifiction happened in the lower heavens (“outer space”), but I don’t see that as absolutely necessary, although it is supported by his evidence. I agree with him,
                it’s just that the evidence is not as strong for this hypothesis.
            </p>
            <p>
                The figure of Jesus in Paul doesn’t have to be a historical person attached to Paul’s circles, it is just a figure that can end Temple sacrifice and bring personal revelation to the practice of Jewish religion. That’s it.
                There’s nothing about actual historicity, just about flesh-incarnation, which is an extremely important part of the Carrier mythicist position. The flesh incarnation is what makes the blood sacrifice redeeming, and allows
                temple sacrifice to end.

                Which readings are indefensible specifically? For the Jewish texts, he uses an ancient Targum to justify that the references in Isiah 53 to the suffering servant were originally interpreted (by some) as referring to the

                That criticism is brain-damaged. The first claim is that JP Morgan didn’t recieve $390 billion, as Sanders says it did, because, the fellow argues, the bank repaid the loan so quickly, that the effective value of such a
                short loan is only worth $31 billion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nonsense! This criticism is a blood-boiling lie. There were two components to the bank bailout, the TARP, where the government publicly bailed them out, and the monetary part, where the Fed pumped new free money into them.
                The less publicly visible part was this second monetary trick. You should think of it as the Fed creating money from nothing, and then handing it out to a bunch of large banks. The actual mechanism was a sort of complicated
                bond sell-resell trick, which gave the banks a no-work automatically profitable transaction loop. The point of this monetary process was to reinflate the deflated balloon, to pump capital into the banks so they would lend
                again.
            </p>
            <p>
                The short terms of the TARP loan, the only reason they were paid back so quickly (or at all), is simply because the Fed did this. The banks also knew it was going to do this. So once JP Morgan got this new-money infusion, it
                could “pay back” the loans, and then award its CEO and board lavish bonuses. This is an absurd situation, as the board did nothing at all except receive a free Fed stimulus. This type of fraud not only makes leftists angry,
                it also made conservatives extremely angry, consider the “End the Fed” movement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Creating money and then distributing it doesn’t change the situation regarding the size of the bailout, it actually makes it larger. Except there is an invisible component, which is the Fed bailout, which is not responsive
                to the public.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sanders proposes to change this by making the Fed operations transparent, with addition of labor representatives. The idea that these people are “unqualified” to handle something so ridiculously simple as monetary policy is
                laughable. If you explain it properly, a person who took high-school algebra would be able to do it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The real issue is that the Fed is a power-center which is not really responsible to the government. It’s independence has been taken over to produce wealth for the few, keep that wealth stable from inflation, and forget its
                mandate to reduce unemployment. I would prefer hyperinflation to that.

                It’s not that vague, Cheney was in charge of all the drills on that day. It can’t be many more than one person, because such a conspiracy isn’t stable, the jig is pretty much up if significantly more than one person knows
                about it. So I tend to think it was Cheney acting alone, maybe with a handful of advisors.

                The most important similarity is the spontaneous violence toward protesters at the rallies. The SS was the organization Hitler set up to quell protests at rallies using violence. In addition, the scapegoating and
                marginalization of ethnic minorities and immigrants, and also the intense obsession with the phallus and sexual authority. Fascism is like an S&amp;M game in politics, except this is not a game, this is the worst catastrophe
                for any country.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other similarities are shared with “normal” Republicans: the complete disregard for civil liberties, like the 1st and 4th amendment, invading other countries on trumped up excuses, and the support for torture of
                political opponents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shared with Republicans and Democrats both is summary executions of political opponents overseas, and inviting large business leaders to craft policy cooperatively within the government, excluding from the policy table
                workers and consumers both. This is the original definition of fascism, created by Mussolini and adopted by Hitler, Franco and all the rest: substituting “class cooperation” for “class struggle”. What that means is that
                elite business leaders and government officials would sit down together and tell everyone else what to do. Excluding Sanders, that’s both political parties in the US in a nutshell.

                I usually throw around the word “fascist” for partial fascism, as Bush II was already about halfway there, and the Clintons were 30% there in the 90s. In case you don’t remember, in the 90s, right-wing people were targeted
                by the IRS and ATF for harassment, by selling them guns and then arresting them for illegal posession, this was the procedure at Ruby Ridge and Waco. This PATCON operation culminated in the catastrophic Oklahoma City
                bombing, which was the harbinger of 9/11. But Trump has deliberately gone all the way to full throated fascism. Whether it’s pretend or not doesn’t matter, it’s unforgivable.

                Sanders is firmly in the libertarian left, in case you haven’t noticed. He just hasn’t make as big a deal about it during the primaries, because his gun stance hurts him, as do some of his policies that contradict targeted
                subsidies that Democrats traditionally support. His fair-play language is criticized by some black leaders as ignoring racism, which it isn’t, but there’s little he can do to change the perceptions, because traditionally
                fair-play policies have deliberately excluded blacks, for example by targeting capital growth to suburban housing and neglecting cities. I am 100% positive this is not the case with Sanders’ policies, but it is very hard to
                persuade black voters of this, because they have experience with GI bill discrimination, mortgage subsidy discrimination, and public works discrimination under previous Democrats.

                He wasn’t “praising Marxist dictatorship”, he was comparing them to the alternative then, which was fascist dictatorship. Castro governed better than Somoza, and Ortega was marginally better than what’s-his-name in
                Nicaragua. The US was committed to destabilizing any leftist governments, Marxist or not (remember that Castro wasn’t even a declared Marxist before the US interventions pushed him to seek help from Russia), and replacing
                the leftists with horrific governments like the one recently in Argentina, that destroy the economy, and allow foreign multinationals and gigantic agribusiness to control the whole economy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sanders is very committed to healthy American business, but he is fair about it, he doesn’t want subsidies, and he certainly doesn’t seek to impose governments on other countries, which is as it should be. He always governed
                as a libertarian socialist, which is more or less what he is, or as close as you can come in a messy real world and get elected.

                Computers are not made by “capitalism”, they are made by markets, free trade. In the case of my computer and OS, I made sure when buying it, to the best of my ability, that it was provided by independent small business,
                right down to the microprocessor. Of course I had no choice in paying for the copy of Windows on the machine that was there before the company I bought from deleted it and replaced it with Linux, but that corporate

                Capitalism is a power structure of tradable property deeds imposed on top of markets, free trade and small business which allow a handful of people to take over those markets so as to prevent free-trade and swallow up the
                small business. That’s what people oppose, not the fair frictionless market equilibrium that would happen in the presence of markets and free trade.

                lose, and fought the hardest. Even the somewhat anti-Semitic Stalin recognized the Jewish issues in 1948, voting to establish Israel in light of the genocide. You should stop reading right-wing propaganda, and start learning

                You can’t restrict access to data inside a general purpose programmable computer system, you need to prevent the computer from being programmable by the user in order to do that, because a coder will write a code to extract
                the data when it is displayed. This is a large part of why modern machines are moving backwards, becoming less generally programmable, with various barriers to users and developers. This tendency is a massive regression in
                freedom and an unacceptable regression in technology— an iPad is less programmable than a laptop, a laptop with Windows is less programmable than a laptop with LInux. A TV box is not programmable at all. The loss of general
                programming ability is a destruction of technology so as to reproduce corporate control of data in an era when it is clear that this is no longer possible or desirable.

                property. Copyright is just a government contract that restricts others ability to help others. You can’t lend data, you can’t take it back. There is nothing you can do to express a property right regarding data, it’s not

                The type of revolution Sanders talks about does not involve imposing state power on individuals, it has already happened to a certain extent in Burlington, without infringing on anyone’s business rights. It is about a change
                in voting patterns which makes people aware of the ties of big-business and government, and reduces the ability of business and government to collude to exclude consideration of the best interest of the public in the
                deliberations of Congress.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rhetoric of revolution is appropriate, it is like the “Gingrich revolution” or the “Reagan revolution”, a shift in composition and attitude in those holding public office, a shift which allows much wider ranging policy
                changes than what usually gets through the gridlock. The revolution is enforced by activism and mobilization by citizens, as opposed to corporate interests, in favor of not-so-radical policies which benefit the public as a
                whole, although they come with no coporate sponsors. These are election law reform, universal health-care, and subsidized college, policies which are standard in Northern Europe and Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your paranoia is due to some delusion that the left is out to impose an agenda which restricts the rights of individuals. Sanders has been mayor in Burlington, a Congressman, and Senator, and has no secret agenda. His agenda
                is his public agenda, and that’s more than you can say for anyone else running for president, or for Congress for that matter.

            <p>
                If the data is a specific industrial process, or a significant government secret, make each individual sign a specific non-disclosure agreement you negotiated specifically with that individual, and that you can sue the
                individual for violating. Even this secrecy negotiation is rife for abuse, as the government classifies half its documents, to protect itself internally from embarassment, while the secrecy surrounding many industrial
                processes just prevents economic growth.

            <p>
                You can’t distribute a work to everyone in the world and expect them all to abide by a universal non-disclosure agreement. There is no property right there, there is no social utility in that, there is no natural right
                there, and it requires a police state to enforce. Even before the DMCA, just enforcing old-style copyright became impossible without looking at everyone’s computer, as it is very easy for me to capture a stream you send me
                by just taking screenshots and recording the sound-card output, then sending a copy to all my friends on a memory stick. Nobody would normally know about this without an intrusive state, as everyone benefits from this
                process locally, including, by the way, the original artist, who gets a wider viewership.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is absurd to imagine property rights for old mathematical papers, because you can’t stop someone from using a mathematical theorem you developed 40 years ago, or distributing the original paper you wrote, no matter what
                you think of the theorem today. Groethendieck does not have a right to get rid of his old papers. He has a social right to be given credit for the result, but that’s not the same thing as getting paid, except indirectly, and
                you don’t need a government to enforce that, it’s enforced by mathematician conventions of the guild of mathematicians for citing results. It’s not enforced by ANY law, the mathematicians will just look at you funny if you
                claim that you proved the Grothendieck Riemann Roch theorem. They’ll say “no you didn’t. Groethendieck did that”, and then send you a copy of his paper.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are not making a principled individual rights argument, you are making an unprincipled justification for a police-state using a nonexistent individual right to control everyone else who has a copy of data they created.

                All individual credit for scientific results are determined by scientific consensus, and are NEVER enforced by government decree or law. There is no law preventing me from claiming I invented universal gravitation. It’s just
                that I didn’t, and the scientific community by consensus credits Isaac Newton. There is a plausible claim for Hooke to the same result, and how to weight the two claims for originality, that’s a complicated process that
                never involves the law or government, and is done entirely informally by the scientific guild.
            </p>
            <p>
                I explained one such credit dispute with Starobinsky and Mukhanov. Why do they deserve credit for inflation theory? If you read their papers from 1980, you see that they do not have an inflaton like later inflation papers,
                they imagine the effective cosmological constant is created by a fourth order term in the gravitational Lagrangian. The modern mechanism was by Guth, and it uses a scalar field as the inflaton. Is that really different? Is
                it different enough to be a new idea? Does it mean that Guth created inflation?
            </p>
            <p>
                By guild conventions, the scalar inflaton IS different enough to be considered a new additional idea, which is why Guth gets some credit, but the actual physical RESULT of a fourth order term is roughly the same sort of
                inflation as a scalar inflaton, and the predictions of inflation were worked out by Mukhanov simultaneously with Guth’s original paper, and quite a while after Starobinsky. Guth’s idea also doesn’t work, due to
                inhomogeneities from a first order phase transition, and Linde also adjusted Guth’s model so that there would be no phase transition, and inflation would end smoothly. That’s another new idea. So when people distribute
                scientific prizes, they end up crediting Starobinsky, Mukhanov, Guth, and Linde, and not, for instance, Stephen Hawking, who was instrumental in popularizing the result throughout the 80s.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scientific guild determines originality by consensus, by discussions. I expect similar artistic guild decisions are made regarding authorship style, and production of new novels, as they were in the science fiction
                community in the 60s and 70s. These decisions are non-binding regarding distribution of publishing profits at the moment. I expect that just as grants interact and are advised with the scientific community, grants for
                publishing will interact with the authorship community, and that the community of authors will make complicated internal decisions regarding originality and credit for novels and poems without any legal mechanism controlling
                them, and without gigantic publishing houses using monopoly generated money to lobby regarding the results. That’s essentially how old literature is evaluated, the stuff that is out of copyright already.
            </p>
            <p>
                The process of granting monopoly rights simply does not credit original authors. If science operated by “copyright” regarding scientific papers, and money distributed by paying people according to the distribution count of
                the number of copies of copyrighted works, then Hawking would have gotten rich off of inflation, as the original results of the 1983 Inflation Workshop roughly reproducing and checking Mukhanov’s results (which Hawking took
                part in) would have made Hawking rich, and Guth, let alone Starobinsky and Mukhanov, would have been ignored and not gotten a penny.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even in terms of guild credit, Starobinsky and Mukhanov were unjustly ignored for a long time. But that’s just the usual nonsense for scientists from the USSR, people in the East were ignored and stepped on by people in the
                West. That part fixed itself last decade, as people reviewed the history.

                The “give” in the case of a copyright work is transferring the data to their hard-drive, at this point it can no longer be said to be “yours” in any sense except artistic originality. This is made obvious by the degree of
                state intrusion required to enforce the alleged property right. You don’t need a police state to know when someone steals a chair, the person who lost the chair will tell you. You need a de-facto police state to enforce
                copyright, as you can see around you today. Police state intrusion into everyone’s data devices just can’t be justified under any circumstances, and that’s what it means to enforce an imaginary right to an abstract pattern
                on someone else’s physical property.
            </p>
            <p>The social utility justification has historically been the only one people used for copyright, from the right and left. There simply never was any basic property justification.</p>
            <p>
                I would believe in “IP anarchy” if the GPL didn’t exist. Since we desperately need the GPL, and it’s piggybacking on copyright law, I hope that copyright on GPL works lasts until the sun burns out. Since software becomes
                obsolete so quickly, the current copyright term is infinite enough.

                If I were dictator of the universe, I would replace the copyright law entirely, by a very complicated system of citations and grants, with decentralized user-measured approval, distributed internally to creators by weighted
                voting on originality and usability, similar to the voting model used on
                <a title="physicsoverflow.org" href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fphysicsoverflow.org%3A2MMDsiN_vJIZBbDMxq1aJKvcimg&amp;cuid=2380705" rel="nofollow noopener">physicsoverflow.org</a>. It’s extremely complicated, and it
                requires criteria for citation, which are enforced in a guild-like manner by the organization which recieves grants. The grants I envision as matching-funds (or 5x matching funds) for user contributions, but internally
                redistributed according to the citation pattern the authorial guild settles on. It may sound extremely elaborate, but it’s basically how science works internally. I don’t have any experience with non-scientific publishing,
                so I am not a good person to design a system, obviously.

                You can’t restrict someone from using anything else “you made”, if you give someone a chair, they can sit on it, and if you repossess it, you are breaking the law. Once you elect to distribute your data, it just isn’t yours
                anymore in any sense of property.
            </p>
            <p>The “work” is not limited to a piece of paper, the notion of property regarding the work is limited to the piece of paper.</p>
            <p>
                The OTHER notion of “property” regarding works is copyright, which is a promise of government action to restrict others from copying data in their possession. To sic the government on people requires a justification, and the
                justification for copyright in the print era was that publishers incurred a cost in soliciting new original work, and they needed a fixed period to recoup the costs, the length of the period being adjustible by Congress to
                balance the need for protecting the public domain and free speech with the need of publishers to remain viable. It’s pretty much the same as the justification for patent protection— you give the industry a fixed period of
                monopoly to recoup the costs of invention. It’s not the best way to reward invention, because monopoly is a very indirect way of recouping costs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recouping the invention or creation costs is the only justification for any sort of monopoly, there is no other purpose. Nobody on the left or on the right has ever claimed that authors have some sort of abstract “right” to
                their own work, not once copyright lapses, not even before. This is not a conservative position or a leftist position. It’s just a nonsensical position I have never heard anyone advocate except you here.
            </p>
            <p>There is no philosophical justification, no “just rights” argument regarding this stuff, there is no “property” notion here, there is nothing except the government preventing others from copying a work for a fixed period.</p>
            <p>
                Further, you are completely deluded if you think the copyright culture is built to reward creators. It only does so indirectly, and it doesn’t work to reward original creators at all. What it is designed to do is maintain a
                publishing industry with reasonable reward to publishing houses that solicit and distribute original work, as opposed to publishing houses that simply republish old material. That’s it. It’s a protection for industry, not
                for individuals.

            <p>
                The US has a terrible history with the artistic creators themselves, the most original “creators” in the US often labor under extreme poverty, authors like Philip K. Dick and Charles Bukowski, mathematicians like Yitang
                Zhang or Grigory Perelman. There is no functioning market mechanism for actually rewarding “creators”, the mechanism rewards capitalists who mass-market publications, and the most highly original creations are not usually
                best-sellers immediately, they take a long time to build a market, usually after a string of far more successful rip-offs that go halfway. The next-in-line rip-offs sell better than the originals, so that the incentive for
                original work is quite skewed, you’re always better off in a market being second in line with a watered down idea than being an Einstein who is first with a radical idea.
            </p>
            <p>
                To counteract this tendency to reward second-in-line authors, academics make a strict honor-code regarding citations, and enforce it by ostracism and penalties. The popular review article or textbook authors are not given
                credit for the results, rather original authors are, despite the fact that 99% of people don’t read the original papers in science either, they also read the more popular second-in-line less radical folks.

            <p>
                Copyrights serve to enrich non-creator corporations, and those who can siphon off control over the product. There is no actual mechanism of significant reward to creators under the corporate system in the US, which is why
                all the creation happens by people who are young and naive, or else hopelessly poor.

                You have no intrinsic right to restrict people from doing whatever they want with data in the first place, except if the government is out there preventing them from doing so using police state measures .That’s why copyright
                is a difficult law, and why it requires special provisions in the constitution. It’s a serious violation of free speech.

                Information is not a chair, it can be copied endlessly at next to no cost. “Creators” can’t pull their own work, because it’s not “theirs” in any sense except owning the original manuscript. There is no natural concept of

                The primary cause of tyranny is not the property rights of individuals, it is misdesigned property rights which do not approach economic equilibrium. Property is justified by a mathematical model of economic competition

                Copyright is not an example of personal property, it is an extremely intrusive state measure which prevents others from duplicating your data. This kind of draconian law is constitutionally limited for a reason, it violates
                the principle that anyone should be free to compete with you by duplicating what you are doing. This kind of restriction on competition is only useful to the extent it encourages innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lapse of copyright is an example of how to design property rights so that they encourage innovation. It worked ok in the period 1790-1990, it stopped working when the internet made publishing essentially free, and then
                copyright became a hindrance rather than a help.
            </p>
            <p>
                I agree that copyright should not be sellable, rather rented to a publisher for the exact period that the publisher is publishing the works exclusively. But that’s not who controls the power it the society. The publishers
                could change the laws, not the authors. In the past, authors were forced to sell or give away the copyright to a publisher to get published. This is how publishing worked. After publication, the rights were traded like a
                commodity, despite these being artificial government enforced constructions, and nowadays, useless ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is not sufficient to restore copyright to the original author, as authors die, and authors sometimes disown their own work and seek to destroy all copies, as for example George Lucas did with the 1977 versions of Star
                Wars (see the “Star Wars Despecialized Editions”), or more significantly, Grothendieck seeking to destroy all his old mathematical papers. Grothendieck does not have a right to un-write his old papers, because their
                existence prevented their results from getting discovered by others, which means he doesn’t get to go around and stop them from being disseminated and read. But this is what he tried to do in the 2000s, until he thankfully
                died. Likewise, the estate of Christopher Marlowe can’t suddenly decide that “The Jew of Malta” makes their ancestor look bad, and get rid of all copies, like Disney tries to do with “Song of the South”. Material that is
                historical needs to be preserved free of restrictions.

                The publishing model needs to be redone in a way that encourages artists to make a living in the new media era. We don’t have such a model. The old model does not work, and nobody is making a replacement. I personally like
                the old British Television model, since I think British socialized television was the only good thing in the whole history of that rotten medium.

                That’s complete nonsense. ALL the serious cases of intentional plagiarism were scientists in the West plagiarizing those the East. There are a thousand examples of outrageous deliberate plagiarism by Western scientists, and
                these were invariably rewarded by recognition and rewards (before the internet made the plagiarism obvious). It is always clear which way the plagiarism goes, because the original work is always better and more complete,
                while plagiarized work always adds some wrong nonsense.
            </p>
            <p>
                For two obvious examples: Sharkovskii’s theorem was deliberately stolen to write the nonsensical paper “period 3 implies chaos”. It’s clearly stolen, because “period 3” doesn’t imply “Chaos”. The only real result in that
                paper is just Sharkovskii’s theorem. The other example is the Soviet theory of Abiotic oil, which was deliberately stolen in Gold’s “Deep Hot Biosphere”, including stealing pressure anvil results and passing them off as his
                own. Gold read Russian fluently, he has no excuse. Unlike “Period 3”, Gold didn’t add nonsense, his own additions were valuable and correct, and in this case I think it was an independent rediscovery, but that’s no excuse.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soviet science didn’t steal anything as a matter of policy, the scientists in the East were more diligent in citing sources than scientists in the West. There were rare cases of individual scientists engaging in what could
                be construed as plagiarism in the East, for instance, Bogoliubov and Shirkov reworking Gell-Mann and Low, but these cases were certainly unintentional, and the B&amp;S cite GM&amp;L properly.

                “Diversity training” and “challenging people on their mistakes” are THE OPPOSITE of contradictory! The people who ignore and marginalize black women scientists when they speak are never leftist activists. They are all
                conservatives without diversity training, who just ignore anyone who isn’t a white male, because, in their stupid mind, this person lacks authority. The people with diversity training just say “you made a mistake”, or “I
                see, you’re right”, ignoring authority structures and paying attention to the content.
            </p>
            <p>
                The diversity training is just there to make sure that you become aware of authority structures, so that you learn to ignore them. The authority structures are imposed unconsciously on you, from the bias you picked up from
                the society, and you need to actively fight against authority, by LISTENING to the people who have little authority, engaging in honest debate, and checking the arguments on their merits, without authority blinding you. The
                default for conservatives is to go by whoever has authority, and you need to fix that with diversity training, so that you stop following the big men. Big men say dumb things.
            </p>
            <p>
                You must never go around “treating people equally”, because authority is real, and people have different amounts of it. If you “treat people equally”, that means, “listen to those with authority”. You have to treat people
                equally AFTER SUBTRACTING THEIR STUPID AUTHORITY. You learn to do that in technical fields, because in technical fields authority counts for nothing. A ten year old kid can beat you at chess.

                that’s only a few people, and they were all purged later. What you think of as “the left” on modern campuses is just a bunch of dumb conservative people who vote Democrat. That’s not the real left, that’s a bunch of
                conservatives who delude themselves. The left on campus is nonexistent, you just have a warped view of what constitutes the left.

                Copyright, as conservatives emphasize, is an artificial government granted monopoly, and constitutes one of the few exceptions to free speech. It is granted in the Constitution with the express intent that it is limited to a
                fixed term. Its purpose is to allow publishers to make a differential profit based on their unique material, and this used to incidentally also allow for authors to make a living. The original terms were 20-25 years, and
                that made a certain amount of sense at the time. Now there is an internet, and the publishing model is entirely broken.
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of restricting freedom using copyright is to encourage innovation. But various industries, especially Disney, have lobbied the government to extend copyright, so that now the terms are the life of the author plus
                seventy years. Even in the print era this made no sense. The creation and maintenance of the public domain is an essential part of the preservation of works which are old enough that they are harmed by copyright rather than
                helped, as their dissemination is no longer profitable, so they rely on public institutions and historically minded individuals for preservation.
            </p>
            <p>
                For scientific publishing, copyright stopped making sense the moment the internet switched on, as in this case, the author is not making money, the author is paying the publisher, and with electronic distribution, the
                publisher does nothing except collate the work and manage the scientific review process, it doesn’t even pay the scientific reviewers. This is why physicists revolted from copyright publishing in 1991 (and even before, if
                you consider the informal university samizdat preprint network of the 80s), and set up Arxiv. Now they are seriously considering suing publishing houses like Elsevier out of existence. Elsevier charges libraries upward of
                $10,000 per journal per year, it does absolutely nothing except manage unpaid authors and referees, print out papers and collate them. It is actively stifling the progress of science by sitting on a hoard of old papers from
                the 60s, 70s and 80s, which, frankly, should be confiscated, as it never should have belonged to them in the first place. These belong to their authors, whose only interest is public dissemination.
            </p>
            <p>
                The model of copyright doesn’t work anymore, it’s only useful purpose now is to protect free-software in subverting the copyright act against itself. The terms of copyright needed to shrink to 5-10 years, and a different
                method of paying authors more directly needs to be considered. The publishing industry is on its last legs, and the music publishing industry has already collapsed.

                It makes a lot of sense when there are 12 candidates, as it allows people to switch allegiance when their candidate is not viable, and get persuaded at the caucus room. A switch to instant runoff voting would allow caucuses
                to become obsolete, but this is resisted in the US so far, perhaps because it would make third parties instantly viable.

                That’s nonsense. The point of socialism is that in market equilibrium there are no rich people, because if someone else is making more money, you just go and do what that person is doing, and then you compete and reduce
                their income. The reason that doesn’t work in the real world is because there are class barriers to competing with people. There is no point to rich people, they are a waste of money.

                The safe spaces are from leftists, but they are stupid and harmless. Berndardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers were great hires, but they were hired in 1980, they would never get hired today. The reason universities hired leftists is

                The reason Republicans have lost their right to exist as a party is because they staged 9/11. Their response to it is to nominate a fascist. It is not clear that the Democrats haven’t also lost their right to exist, as they

            <p>
                The way the anarchist left prroposed to decrease business power is by STOPPING the government from enforcing property rights. This means people take over their own houses and factories, the ones they live and work in, as
                absentee landlords and owners are no longer able to enforce their authority.
            </p>
            <p>
                I personally don’t think that’s a great idea. I prefer a government that enforces property rights, but also enforces graduated tax and ownership policies that have the effect of distributing ownership widely, for instance by
                making payment of rent or salary contingent on regulated equity gains. I’m not quite as radical as the anarchists. I see the value in enforcing property rights, because it allows a stable development of new authority and
                business centers, which are not terrible as long as they are competitive or temporary. Then again, maybe the anarchists would have developed in this way, if they had been allowed to survive.

                The reason labor is entitled to surplus value is because in economic equilibrium, wages rise so that there is no profit. In economic equilbrium, wages are negotiated at zero unemployment, so that you are forced as an
                employer to pay the highest possible wage to keep workers from leaving to your competitor. Under these conditions, the workers make just enough to purchase the total output at peak production. This is called “Say’s law”.
            </p>
            <p>
                What Marx noted (in Capital I) is that “Say’s law” is completely wrong! The workers are NOT making anywhere near their equilibrium wage, because they are competing in the presence of unemployment. When unemployment is at 0%,
                then Say’s law would become true (Marx doesn’t say this, but it is clear he knows this). That’s because when unemployment is at 0%, then workers wages start to rise very quickly due to the strong bargaining position of
                workers, and wages rise cutting into profits until profits are only as far above zero as is required to justify capital expansion and paying corporate bonds and dividends. This situation actually started to happen in the
                late 90s when unemployment dipped below 4%, it happens every time unemployment is very low, it’s the ideal that Keynesians aim for.
            </p>
            <p>
                The failure of Says law in an economy with unemployment means that there is too little demand in a capitalist economy, because workers are chronically underpaid, due to competition with the unemployed. In Marx’s time, that
                meant a 14 hour day at subsistence wages, there were no regulations back then. Without a policy that takes unemployment to zero, if you want an industrial economy to not decend into depression, that means you are forced to
                prop up demand by massive state spending, by minimum wage laws, and by negative income taxes (like the EITC). These policies help the situation, but Say’s law still fails even with these measures, and it is failing today.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can tell that Say’s law is failing through the effect of minimum wage rises, or stimulus spending. If Say’s law were really true, then any minimum wage rise would be immediately offset by inflation, and any stimulus
                spending would decrease private production, as production would be near peak. In real life, it’s the opposite— raising minimum wage has no effect on inflation until the minimum wage gets absurdly high (it never got there
                yet), and government stimulus spending does not produce inflation or decrease private production, it just reduces unemployment and gets the economy going.
            </p>
            <p>
                The evidence for Marx’s observations that Say’s law is entirely false has been overwhelming and incontrovertible since the 1930s, it is the foundation of Keynesian economics. Due to political pressure, Keynesians can’t say
                “Marx”. But their theory is founded on Marx’s critique.

                Hamas is not a collaborationist government, they are actual representatives. They are oppressive in other ways, similar to the horrible things that the ANC did under apartheid, or the partisans did in the second world war.
                When you have a network of paid collaborators, they are going to get executed eventually, and sometimes innocent people will get executed too, as in South Africa. The solution to that is for Israel not to have networks of
                paid collaborators, but that’s not going to happen, so best to boycott, divest, sanctions, and so on, like in South Africa, until Israel comes to its senses, retreats to 67 borders, pays reparations to displaced persons, and
                makes reasonable treaties for water rights.

                This statement is so ignorant, that it justifies the claim that you are illiterate. If you were to read anything at all, you would see that the anarchists were an offshoot from Marx, led by Bakunin. They were as left as left
                can get, they were further left than the Marxists were.

            <p>
                Leftism is NOT about increasing government control, it is about DECREASING big-business control. You don’t have to do that by increasing government control, you can decrease both business and government control at the same
                time. It’s just tricky to do. Anarchists are not exactly “no government”, they are “no authority”, and it is possible to reduce the degree of authority in society by using laws uniformly applied, by a (*gasp*) anarchist
                government!

                Leftists are marginalized in technical field for NON-obvious reasons, you probably don’t even know who the marginalized leftists are. Most of the great Soviet research was ignored for political reasons, inflation theory is
                Soviet, it is due to Starobinsky and Mukhanov, lasers are originally Soviet, conformal field theory is largely Soviet. The theory of quarks was spun off from the “Sakata model”, and the reason you never heard of Sakata,
                unlike Gell-Mann and Zweig, is largely because he was a Japanese Marxist.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even completely non-Marxist leftist physics work, like the S-matrix theory of the 60s and early 70s, what eventually became string theory, was so deeply marginalized, from 1974 to 1984, that all the theorists were driven out
                of academia, or literally driven mad, or driven to suicide. I never learned about “Regge trajectories”, “The Pomeron”, “Unitarity cuts”, despite this stuff being required to reproduce high-energy (and low energy) near-beam
                QCD scattering. The Pomeron hypothesis was spectacularly confirmed in 1996 when P-P and P-Pbar cross sections became equal, as Pomeranchuk predicted (in the USSR, in 1960), but nobody said anything about it, except noting it
                at the accelerator.
            </p>
            <p>
                When string theory was taken up again, it was by a politically dominant class of right-wingers, who avoided crediting the radicals that made the theory in the 60s and 70s. That only changed when the internet came along, and
                people could review the original references.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having been in technical field, I not only witnessed the marginalization of the best work by leftists, I also personally witnessed a certain amount of racism and sexism. It’s hardly ever intentional, although with sexism it
                sometimes is (the intention with sexism is not usually to oppress anyone, the intention is to get laid). Most of the time it’s usually just a subtle dismissal of people.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sexism has been a deep problem for decades, it’s why Choquet Bruhat took so long to get recognition for GR initial value problem, that’s also why the wavelet revolution took so long, wavelets are “female mathematics” (as
                nonsensical as it sounds, but wavelets have a mother, not a father). Racism was less of a problem, but only because technical fields were not at all diverse until last decade, I mean ethnically diverse. Hardly anybody from a
                poor or marginalized background would go into a field like mathematics where you can’t make money despite working 100 times harder than any CEO. But they are diverse now, as you can’t really stop people from learning math.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding racism, I do remember a materials science seminar by the person who was, at the time, the only black female student in the department. It had a few new ideas, but there were mistakes too, I thought, and the
                mistakes made it overall mediocre or bad in my opinion. Now a white dude delivering the same material would have been harassed mercilessly, allowing him to defend himself and fix his mistakes. But the black girl was left
                alone, no questions, despite having made what I thought were obvious mistakes.
            </p>
            <p>
                This type of kid-glove treatment is NOT being nice, it is preventing the type of challenges that improve your ideas. I was a student too. So at the end of the seminar, when nobody else challenged the nonsense, I got up and
                savagely tore apart what I saw as the wrong stuff. Some were actual mistakes. Sometimes I misunderstood something, or she had different conventions, as always. But because my tone was hostile, as always, everyone at the
                seminar room looked at me like I was George Wallace or something. She came up to me afterwards, and thanked me for the tough questions, so it’s not like black students want special treatment. They just get it anyway.
            </p>
            <p>Part of racism is ignoring people instead of challenging their technical mistakes. I don’t think mandatory diversity training would hurt anyone, I certainly could have used it.</p>

                Wow. You really are a theorist! Sure, I think you’re totally right about everything, but it’s a really academic way of saying it, and online, this type of speech is time-consuming to read through, and is less effective as
                propaganda, no matter how accurate and insightful. I think that’s partly due to your insistence on using neutral words, and avoiding “loaded words”, that’s the foundation of academic conventions, and it’s also the first
                thing the early internet got rid of. There was no point in avoiding propaganda when anyone is free to respond with counterpropaganda, it’s just a waste of time in that context , as propaganda becomes useless when there is no
                power structure dictating who gets to speak. That frees it up to be useful as a rhetorical flourish, instead of a power-reinforcement device.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally, I think that it’s proper to use loaded propaganda words so long as you use them in a way that isn’t boring. With a surprising twist, so that they subvert the authority they are intended to support, instead of
                supporting it by silent consensus. Words don’t dictate meaning by themselves, the author can use them to create the opposite meaning. This is how the word “Queer” was repurposed. You can do it with just about anything.

                Yeah yeah, you think what you want. But the libertarian and anarchist philosophies developed on the far left, in the late 19th and early 20th century, as a reaction to Marxism. The spit among communists was along the lines
                of Marx/Bakunin, with Marx and Engels advocating total state control, and eventually this turned into Lenin’s “dictatorship of the proletariat”, while Bakunin was advocating for a distributed power structure with independent
                organizations coming together to form a communitarian society.
            </p>
            <p>The anarchist faction was dominant in 1936 Spain, while the communists won in Russia, and suppressed and executed the anarchists.</p>
            <p>
                The anarchist philosophy has transmuted in the intervening time to a sort of libertarian left, which advocates worker control of industry, and distributed ownership. American libertarians just took the “little government
                power” aspects of classical left-libertarianism, and removed the “little business power” aspects to make their nonsensical inconsistent philosphy. American libertarians don’t notice that their version of “liberty” devolves
                into fascism with gigantic corporations taking over the world. Rather, they do notice, but they like it, because they are paid by the heads of those corporations.

                It’s not significant to read the individual comments, they’re mostly of the nature of “The ghost field gives a contribution which cancels out too many of the polarization modes to make your theory physical, it must be
                adjusted with scalars…” and other stuff like that which won’t help the uninitiated.

                I am totally sane. When I actually had a paranoid attack for a week or so about 10 years ago, I couldn’t do math. I just read Nik Weaver’s “Forcing for Mathematicians” the last few days both to keep me sane, and because it’s
                amazing. I’d recommend that for everyone, as it’s the math book of the decade.

                I am mentally and emotionally frozen at age 15 because it is impossible to go any further within the social order, that’s largely what happens to socialists it is true. Thankfully, there are technical fields, like physics
                and mathematics, where being emotionally 15 doesn’t stop you from contributing to humanity.

                I don’t spread any lies. My family happened to be visiting a West Bank town a month or two before the 1987 intifada, and a car went by spreading leaflets. My father can read arabic, but he wouldn’t translate the leaflets, he
                just said “time for us to get out of here”. I have to use my imagination to reproduce what the leaflet was saying, but it was clearly a call to organize and strike against the occupation.
            </p>
            <p>The first months of 1987, like the years of the Lebanon war, did more to alert Israelis that their government was no longer representing the best-interest of the people than all the protest and theory in the world.</p>
            <p>
                When I was 15, I wanted to join the intifada, and lob stones at the occupation. The “missiles” are a joke, and perhaps even a false flag— the “Hamas rockets” are completely absurd, they are meter-long pipes filled with fuel.
                I don’t believe they are significant, and I believe the proper response to these things is “hey, look! You built a toy rocket.”

                The Palestinian people is a legitimate group, they are just as real as “Israeli Jews”, who had never been a people before 1948 either. The anger and hatred is justified, as the Jews refuse to pay reparations, go back to 68
                borders, open the borders, and live in peace with their neighbors.
            </p>
            <p>Some of the Israelis want to slaughter the Palestinians, they are in small minority parties. They are not significant, they are only there like the racist Dixiecrats were there, to say “Hey, look, things could be worse”.</p>

                My mommy was an extreme anti-socialist and my daddy was a Lt. Colonel in the Israeli army. They moved to the US because they love capitalism, not because I was saying I wouldn’t serve in the military. My parents didn’t take
                me seriously when I said I wouldn’t serve, they laughed and said I would change my mind when all my friends were drafted. Of course I did not change my mind, and those people who were drafted are no longer my friends.

                I was not afraid of the IDF, I was against the IDF, and at the time, I was the only one in my family and in my school and in my community, there are many more today. I will continue to speak out, because the Israeli
                blindness to Palestinian suffering is comparable only to the German blindness to Jewish suffering in the second world war, or to South African blindness to native Black suffering in the 80s, when Israel and South Africa were
                jointly developing atomic bombs.

                It’s not a lie, what’s going on in Israel. There a ton of Jews in Israel who refuse to serve in the occupied territory, it is now a standard unwritten checkbox for the Israeli draft whether you are willing to enforce the
                occupation, and the leftist Jews are reassigned to other duties, far from any Palestinians. There are those who will not serve at all, and they are now quietly given a release form instead of being put in prison. There are
                those who actively protest, and those people are marginalized and discriminated against. I am not in Israel anymore. I would never serve. I realized this in 1987, when the first Intifada broke out, and I was 14. Thankfully
                my family took me back to the US before I was 15, so my draft status never became an issue.

                Sowell fails to understand economics. Horowitz just sold out for money. The left is about correcting market failures, because the economic model of capitalism simply concentrates power to an oligarchy. That’s undeniable

                children, and they had absolutely no power, even in groups. The situation of a typical Jew in a camp was that of a homeless person on the street, and I don’t see you going around distributing AK-47s to the homeless, or

                The communist Partisans took individual Jews, they liked Jews as they could be certain Jews were not double agents, they just couldn’t take families with elderly and small children, and most of the victims were family units,
                not young individuals capable of fighting. There were also sporadic resistance movements set up by zionist Jews in their 20s, who were trying to save their family. They could tunnel out of ghettos and steal food and get a
                few handguns from the communist resistance, but most individuals were trying to get their families out to safety in any way possible.

                The elite in Germany provided Zyklon to the camps to be used as an insecticide, it was diverted in relatively small quantities to kill people, most of the Zyklon was used to kill lice, you only need a little bit of Zyklon to
                kill a million people, and Zyklon was only used at Auschwitz. Treblinka used carbon monoxide, and the Jew-exterminators on the Russian front used bullets. The people providing Zyklon averted their eyes from the genocide, the
                same way nobody talks about the homeless in the US, or nobody talks about Native Americans. The elite in the US was extremely Protestant and extremely anti-Semitic in the 1940s, and they dismissed the reports of genocide as
                propaganda until 1945, despite the mounting evidence. I agree with your sentiments, but I think you are insensitive to the issues of power, and Jews in the 1940s had none, despite the propaganda from Germany blaming them for
                all the world’s troubles.

                It’s not an incorrect argument. There were “hundreds” of political prisoners in the late USSR, you could probably find an approximately equal number of political prisoners in the US in the 1970s. The Gulag prison system was
                not even that big in Stalin’s time, it had about a million people back then at any one time. It was always a negligible part of Soviet labor.

                The people who could choose their jobs were ordinary citizens, not prisoners. The wages for the jobs were set by administrators by pure supply and demand. Nobody will tell you that, not the communists, because they don’t

                best to call a person who supports the legal property-rights structure of Capitalism a “Keynesian”, so I call myself a Keynesian. The names are not important, only the policies matter.

                I only need to read the first paragraphs of the summary to know that this book is spouting ignorant nonsense. I read Stalin when I was a kid. Stalin made himself famous by the slogan “socialism in one country”, which meant
                Russia needed to build up everything for herself, without reliance on any imports or exports. Unlike Lenin, who wanted heavy industry in Germany and Hungary to support the USSR, Stalin didn’t want or need a worldwide
                socialist revolution, because if there were a revolution in Western Europe, Russia would be marginalized by other socialist countries. All his efforts were to make sure Russia would be completely self-sufficient for all raw
                materials and oil, and in all basic industry. He also wanted to make sure that all the other Marxist countries would be dependent on Russian steel and Russian oil. That’s what he did in 4 five year plans. By 1960, Russia was
                entirely self-sufficient, and had the industrial base for development. This part of communist development was largely economically successful, in terms of production quotas met or exceeded, and in comparison with the West.
                That’s not much of a surprise, because the Soviet and Western large firms were largely the same in structure and planning.
            </p>
            <p>
                The development of consumer goods and general plenty, this part was what failed, as unlike heavy industry, successful light-goods and consumer goods production requires independent small businesses and independent
                decisionmaking. This was already clear by 1965 to mathematically oriented planners inside the USSR, like Kosygin, but they didn’t succeed in freeing up the system, because by then it was a dictatorship of the nomenklatura.
                The freeing didn’t start until 1985, by which time the population was so sick of the repression that the whole system was dismantled.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whenever there was an independent socialist revolution, Stalin squelched it by force and infiltration, whether in Spain or in Greece, or in Yugoslavia. He was happier for the fascists to take over Spain that independent
                non-Leninist labor unions take over. He allowed partisans to be killed by the Nazis in Poland, rather than send the Red Army to help, because then there wouldn’t be an independent leadership. He threatened to execute Tito in
                1950, but failed, because Tito’s was actually an independent revolution.
            </p>
            <p>Stalin was not interested in any revolution not under his direct control. In that, he was different than Khruschev or Brezhnev, who actually supported truly independent Marxists all over the world.</p>
            <p>
                My view of history doesn’t come from my family, I am just telling you that part because it is interesting. Most of my mother’s side of the family did not survive, of course (we are Jews). One of the only really good source
                for concentration camps is Primo Levi’s account written right after the war concluded.

                what anti-Jewish sentiment is all about. It’s just a vague feeling that “that guy is not one of us, and won’t support us” among those who are deeply Christian. I hope that it is clear that this is nonsense, but I am not sure
                that this is so, considering how hopeless all of Sanders real outreach to black communities down south has been so far.

                That might be true, I am sure there were at least a few among them who personally dreamed of owning a pastry shop after the war, but one of their jobs was distributing anti-fascist communist propaganda. When an organization
                is run by Moscow, I think it can be safely called a communist organization.

                There was no mention of socialist resistance, because the socialists were executed quickly. The ones who survived were partisans in the woods, like Tito, and they survived through raids on farms, stealing food, asking for
                help from various people in the countryside, and so on. The ones who were caught were shot. The ones who sympathized in the camps stopped working and were also shot. The Jews were also executed at random times and for no
                reason, as there was no recognition of Jews as human among the guards.

                Calling Sanders anti-semitic is as absurd as calling Obama an anti-black racist. It shows that you have no ability to criticize Israel’s policy now that it is the strong party, not the weak. Judaism is about respect for the
                weak and oppressed, not the strong and oppressive, regardless of ethnicity. In that, Sanders is quite a bit better Jew than most of you folks.

                That’s easy to say from the comfort of your computer, but my grandfather was breaking rocks at a landslide on a railroad, and one point of pride when he spoke about it (he hardly ever did) is that they never finished the
                work before the war ended, the railroad never functioned. The partisans were not only all communists, they were taking orders from the USSR, who organized the brigades in a loose intelligence collective with orders coming
                from Moscow. This continued until the end of the war, when the Yugoslav partisans split from Moscow in an acrimonious rift, due to the insistence that Yugoslavia and Bulgaria be joined to keep Tito out of power.

                The new-left was purged from universities and institutions in the 1980s and 1990s, the purge was entirely completed by the mid 2000s, helped along by 9/11. There is no left anymore in any US institutions, which is a pity,
                because it means there are no more serious scientists or serious humanities academics.

            <p>
                The handful that remain are either very old, like Chomsky, or very isolated, like Cornel West. They need to make do by using media to get an audience outside of academia, because the academics have been taken over by right
                wing think tanks. It’s worst in economics, where the purge of leftists means that all the Keynesians were eliminated in most institutions of economics. Since only the Keynesians understood inflation, unemployment, and
                monetary policy, it meant that there was no one left in 2008 who knew what to do regarding the financial crisis. This catastrophe has had to slowly be reversed, and there are a few leftists in some institutions again, the
                ones that came to their senses in 2008.

                I don’t point to Scandinavia today, because Scandinavia today is highly capitalist, after the right-wing governments of the 2000s reversed many of the pro-employment and distributed ownership measures that were tried
                earlier. The development of Scandinavia is very complicated, and many of the successes have nothing to do with the welfare state. But the universal health-care, subsidized family leave, and free college are no-brainers,
                these are implemented in the most capitalist states also, and this is what Sanders is pointing too.

                The “new man” of communism is very different from the “new man” of the left, although they are both an attempt at changing political consciousness. The communists wanted a good worker who fit into a slot, the new left wanted
                a long-haired pot-smoking individualist who could make revolution. Neither vision is particularly radical today, it is not clear either vision was ever radical.
            </p>
            <p>
                The political theorists on the left in the late 1960s were responding to the failure of collectivist visions in producing actual radical social movements. The role of collectivist movements is complicated, there is some role
                for such collectives in pressing for better wages through unions, but the general idea that collectives manage better is, I believe, completely false. The left is not about collectives, it is about sane economics, which
                doesn’t concentrate power and capital to the top.
            </p>
            <p>
                The proper leftist theory is simply to encourage decentralized ownership, by having and protecting small business, encouraging distributed ownership of workplaces, and decentralizing decisionmaking as far as possible. This
                model was developed successfully in Scandinavia. Not by the government. By a student at a subsidized university in Helsinki, by Linus Torvalds. The decentralized model is what gave you the Linux operating system.

                It doesn’t change anything. The only survivors were complicit, it was impossible to survive without helping the regime, that’s why all the survivors felt guilty. They knew that there were partisans out there who were able to
                survive without collaborating, somewhere in the woods, but these people were all communists, and nobody usually knew how the heck they did it.

                Reagan visited the USSR about a year after his “honeymoon”, Bernie Sanders is always first. Sanders, as mayor of Burlington, had an independent foreign policy which was set up as a critique of Reagan’s idiotic one. Unlike
                Reagan, he didn’t support the fascist movements, and he criticized the communists based on the fact that their system didn’t work, not based on ideological paranoia that they were taking over the world. Everyone on the left
                knew that the communists were not taking over the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Everyone can find a job” was implemented in the USSR in the 1930s— if you went to an active shipyard, or to a construction site, chances were always good that they had work that was unfinished, and you would be put to work
                immediately. This was in the interest of the managers, who were paid to recruit. The only people who couldn’t find a job in this situation are seriously ill, and the official unemployment of 0% was roughly accurate. There
                were, in later years, a few people who collected unemployment checks because they couldn’t find work in their own field, but this was due to the later generous unemployment packages, which didn’t exist earlier. There are no
                unemployable people, sorry.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was no real unemployment past the 1930s in the USSR, the last unemployment offices closed in the mid 1930s, because there was nobody out looking for work. This wasn’t government propaganda. It was a product of the
                effective free labor market set up in the USSR. The problems of communism are serious, but unemployment was not one of these, solving that problem was the most notable and nearly only success.
            </p>
            <p>
                the problems were in capital allocation for new business, in centralized decision-making that prevented people from implementing independent ideas, in lack of ability to hire construction firms for independent expansion,
                because top-down projects were taking all the people, in lack of ability to resell “government property” independently without getting arrested, in the lack of a floating price for consumer goods and tradable commodities, in
                the lack of floating currencies, in the top-down planning of international industries, in all the problems that the dissident progressives inside the East were noticing and complaining about, and getting arrested and
                marginalized over.
            </p>
            <p>
                The one success of the communists was that anyone who wanted a job could easily find one. This was reproduced in the West without dismantling capitalism, whenever there was a jobs program for eliminating unemployment, or
                sufficient stimulus to absorb nearly all unemployment, as in the US in the 1950s, or in England in the 30s and 40s and 50s, or in Germany in the 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s, or in France, or anywhere else. The production of
                unemployment is the major structural defect in the functioning of capital markets, and it is completely unnecessary. Temporary jobs for those looking for work can allow full employment even when people are looking for a
                suitable job, an unemployed graphic designer in the East could work construction or cleaning for months, or even in bookkeeping, while looking for a position. It was always easy to find a job even in communist Romania,
                unless you were a political dissident.

                Republican Spain was a relative economic success compared to either the USSR or Franco, the economic parts that were free Spain were ok, the worker cooperatives were relatively productive compared to either capitalism or
                communism. Free spain was only problematic in that it still didn’t have independent small business and capital allocation independent of large collectives, in that case labor unions. The capital allocation structure wasn’t
                structured entrepreneurially as in developed capitalism, it was structured according to political union decisions. But the system didn’t stick around long enough to see what the unions would do with capital allocation.

            <p>
                The USSR was left wing in foreign policy only. The internal policy repressed the left wing, which as I told you consisted of dissidents. The Soviet left was Dilas and Dubcek, and to some extent Kosygin, at least in the 60s,
                and Gorbachev, in the 80s. The Soviet left was marginalized.

            <p>
                I am happy you credit the “theory” to me, but it is the universal idea of the anti-communist left. That’s pretty much the whole of the Western left, and anyone from the East both knows nothing about it, and thinks they know
                everything, because they assume it has a relation to what they experienced as the communist left. The communist left is dead, get used to it.

                I know where all these people were, thanks. These people were the closest things to progressives within the Soviet block. They were aiming to reduce state control and create a real decentralized economy. They all failed,
                except for Tito. Tito’s socialism was very far from Soviet communism, at least past 1950, because he experienced the total economic collapse caused by Soviet policies in 1948, and he didn’t want to continue this. He
                reprivatized farming in 1949, after only a few months of collectivization, and he introduced private industry, and formed the nonaligned block. That’s as progressive as you get for the communists.
            </p>
            <p>
                Capitalism is not “imperfect”, it’s even more horrible than communism if it isn’t mitigated by Keynesian measures. The West knows this, and implements minimum wage and enormous amounts of expenditures in R&amp;D, military,
                and roads, to keep consumer demand from collapsing. This is the extent of the West’s ability to manage capitalism so that it doesn’t decend into a permanent depression.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point is that this is not enough. The idealized situation in an economy is self-directed enterprises, which reinvest their profitability in their own expansion, and where workers have a say. The only way to achieve this
                is to encourage small business, worker owned business, and decentralized ownership of stock in publicly traded companies, with strong bargaining power for employees. Any other option is terribly destructive, you can’t see
                it, because you have no idea what the struggles against concentrations of capital in the West were, you only know the completely unrelated struggles against concentration of state power in the East. You need to know what
                happened in the West’s struggles too, to get a picture of why so many people were fooled into thinking the USSR represented some sort of left-wing. The Soviets were like a monarch butterfly, mimicking the socialist left
                without doing anything useful to help.

                I see Fred Hampton as a slightly more radical counterpart to Martin Luther King. I don’t believe King would have been shot had he been a simple anti-segregationist, the opposition to the war is what made him a pariah, and
                his socialism made him a “communist” to Hoover and therefore a menace. But it’s much the same, the past is past, and your position is reasonable also.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I think is unarguable, however, is that King’s economic prescriptions were based on a full employment policy, this is the holy-grail of the left. Once you have full employment, labor becomes strong enough to win better
                wages, and better conditions. This is what Sanders is making in his platform, through stimulus, education subsidy, and increases in minimum wage. Those all decrease unemployment. In addition, Medicare-for-all makes health
                care portable, allowing workers to switch jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jesse Jackson continued MLK’s economic legacy, and Sanders supported him in ’84 and ’88. Now it is only Sanders himself who is continuing the legacy on the national stage. The details of the assassination, we can disagree
                about, I don’t know for sure what is right. But on the question of Sanders’ economic prescriptions mostly agreeing with King’s (although somewhat less radical, as they don’t guarantee full employment), I don’t think you can
                reasonably disagree with that.

                What you experienced as “socialism” meant government control of all business, the inability to do anything independently without okaying it with a party member, the inability to buy cloth, make clothing, and resell your
                excess to others, the loss of your job if you dared criticize the government or apply for a visa, the lack of independent venture capital from anyone other than the state, the lack of political independence from Moscow, and
                a trade system based on the decisions in Moscow of what your country will be made to manufacture.

                This system is a totalitarian monstrosity, and it only pays lip-service to the ideas of socialism, for propaganda purposes. It differs very little from the Western system of large firms dominating industry, because in this
                case, the only firm is the government, and this is run like one gigantic business. It is no more extreme socialism than the US is extreme capitalism. It is extreme governmental control.

                Actual socialists, the ones outside the USSR, advocated for preventing the consolidation of capital in businesses by distributing ownership widely. Only a small minority of these people wanted to structure the whole society
                as a single corporation, those were the Marxist Leninists, and these were the worst of the bunch. These folks could never win elections, so they took over governments by force.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of socialism is preventing the problems of capitalism. The people in the Eastern block don’t know the problems of capitalism, they only know the problems of communism, at least, that’s what it was like 20 years ago,
                now some of them have experience with the problems of capitalism.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point of socialism is to fix the problems of capitalism, and the goal of socialists is not to reproduce the Marxist Leninist state, but to make sure ownership and decision making are decentralized. Centralizing all power
                to the Soviets makes about as little sense as centralizing all power to Lockheed Martin, or Halliburton.

                Even within the East, there were those who knew this, but they were outside of Romania. The progressive Soviets were Kosygin and Dubcek, and also to a lesser extent Tito and Kardelj, and more pointedly Dilas, they knew that
                the system could not persist as a top-down planned economy, that capital allocation needed to be decentralized, and corporations needed to be free to expand through local purchasing, and hire, fire, and redesign without
                top-down constraints. These ideas were suppressed within the Eastern block as ruthlessly as any other deviation from orthodoxy.

                Sanders support for the black movement didn’t end in the 60s, he was a great supporter of Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988, and delivered Vermont for him. Sanders has opposed the policies that marginalize America’s cities, and
                has stood against the Clintons when they were race-baiting. The Clinton’s race-baiting was a calculating move to win elections, but some of it they really mean.

                I know the violence of the era very well, I’m not that young. When MLK was leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott and preaching non-violent resistance to segregation, he was applauded by the press, and he was a media darling.
                Then he won the Nobel Peace prize, and he became a part of the controlled opposition, and he was a hero to both the right and the left, as he is today. You must remember that the Republicans back then opposed segregation,
                starting in 1954, segregation was terrible for business, nobody wants to have to deal with segregated hotels and restaurants, it drives away black customers and anti-racist white customers both. Eisenhower led black troops
                too, and American racism reminded people at home of Hitler. There was no love of it anywhere except among ignorant southerners.
            </p>
            <p>
                MLK stopped being a darling and became a controversial figure when he expanded his critique from segregation to economic power and the war in Vietnam. This made him a real radical, and from this point on, he began to be
                attacked as a communist. He was assassinated by the CIA in 1968, because his voice was inspiring a new generation of anti-capitalist black voices. Many of those folks were assassinated too, some in their beds as they slept.
            </p>
            <p>
                The economic program MLK was proposing was based on a zero unemployment policy, through a permanent stimulus jobs program. This was a staple of American democratic socialist thinking. The Democrats preferred to cut people
                checks rather than provide jobs, as welfare is a mechanism of control rather than empowerment. MLK aligned himself with various international movements that supported anti-colonialism and indigenous rights, and was on the
                real socialist left, not in any controlled opposition. That’s what makes him great, and that’s what makes his modern whitewashing into a bourgeoise anti-segregationist so revolting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cornel West would not be assassinated because he is not a leader of a movement. God forbid, Sanders might be, he is taking a chance. So please vote for him, as he is really the proper continuation of MLK’s economic and
                political policy, as West would tell you, and anyone else who is deep into the civil rights movement, like Harry Belafonte.

                I understand the danger, and I hope I’m not underestimating it, but nothing ever happens the exact same way twice, and analogies are tricky. The US has already had it’s Hitler regime, and it’s not Trump, it was Cheney. Trump
                has come out strongly against the previous fascists, that’s 99% of his appeal. The rest of his campaign is racist pandering and stupidity. I’m not voting for him, but I don’t agree that you can tar him by his backers. The US
                communist party supports Sanders, that doesn’t imply that Sanders will have show trials and gulags. Likewise, Duke supports Trump does not imply that Trump supports Duke.

                Of course I’m subhuman to Duke, I’m a jew. He has Jews dead-center on his paranoid target. But Trump isn’t Duke, he just got endorsed by Duke, and Trump’s racism has so-far mostly been the ridiculous law-and-order Nixonian
                pandering type. It isn’t even clear he knows what he is talking about when he says it, it’s all stream of consciousness campaigning, with the aim of “looking alpha”. That’s his big schtick, look like a powerful insulting
                domineering big man with a big stick, and this is the Hitler electioneering method. It’s the same Hitlerian domination business with his violence. Of course it scares me, it’s straight out of the fascist playbook, but I
                still can’t take his fascism seriously, maybe that’s a mistake.

                He’s a New Yorker, and I just can’t imagine how he could possibly be as racist and ignorant as he pretends to be, he must have grown up with experience of diversity all his life. Anyway, I don’t think he has any chance
                against Sanders, and only a little tiny chance against Clinton, depending on the indictment situation, but even an indicted Clinton can beat him, I think, so I try to think about him very little.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I said, the only thing he said which I think justifies his Republican support is blaming Bush for 9/11. That’s a big deal. If he leads the Republican party, that’s the end of the Bushes as a political force forever, and
                that’s something. That’s why I want him to win the nomination and lose in November. But God help us all if he wins the election. It’s a terrible risk.

                Clinton’s major reform was the EITC expansion. This impacted poorer communities more than anything else. That was attached to welfare reform. But the real problem is the inability to build up capital inside cities. All the
                capital goes into suburban housing, and cities are dominated by sleazy landlords. Clinton doesn’t propose anything to fix this, there is no mechanism to provide capital to city-dwellers. Sanders pioneered community owned
                housing in Burlington, and I trust he knows what he is doing with regard to urban policy.

                Land redistribution is a non-communist leftist policy in response to feudal land-distribution. It was implemented in Japan by Douglas MacArthur. The construction of cooperatives subsidized by the state is something that
                other leftist governments do, for example, Israel and the kibbutsim, it’s not a communist policy exactly. The limited nationalizations are consistent with a mixed economy and private business, 30% is not 100%, which is what
                communists advocate, it is more like France or England.
            </p>
            <p>
                The nationalization policy was probably necessary, as those economies are dominated by enormous landholders, who keep the population in serfdom, although I don’t know anything about the situation in Nicaragua in the 1970s.
                Communist policy is top-down planning and heavy industry, and this is not the type of policy that was implemented. I know that in the US every leftist government is automatically “communist”, but the Sandanistas just don’t
                qualify. A true communist would have been disappointed.

            <p>
                Southern black voters used to vote for the most progressive realistic candidate. This time, they chose not to. This, despite Sanders clear progressive voice, despite his strong chances with independents and Republicans.
                That’s anti-strategic voting, and that’s a total surprise.

                I expected Bernie to lose the black vote to some small extent due to Clinton’s history in the south, but not by 80 points! Not with a candidate who was a civil rights activist, not by the only candidate who addresses
                structural racism with real policy. Not when his opponent is a race-baiting triangulator.
            </p>
            <p>The only reason I can see for his failure to connect in the south is the his non-Christian background. That’s not sensible voting, sorry. That’s just bigotry.</p>

                MLK was a democratic socialist, and his top priority was targeting unemployment to zero, with a jobs stimulus, and targeting lack of educational opportunities, to attack the structural inequality in many disenfranchised
                communities with emphasis on the black community he was a part of. This vocal socialism was the reason that he was villified by the media when he was alive. His post-death sainthood among the bourgeoisie airbrushes away his
                democratic socialism, and makes him sound like a 1960s version of Al Sharpton, an opportunist riding to power on racial issues. That’s not what MLK was, he was a great thinker in the American democratic socialist tradition,
                like W.E.B DuBois or Cornel West, or Bernie Sanders.

                What black voters down South think they “know” has to be challenged, much as what I know has been challenged. I agree that there is a space for polite disagreement. The fact that there is a tremendous amount of structural
                racism and discrimination does not mean that you need to base a campaign solely around this fact, because the policies required are not a simple function of helping out people who are discriminated against. Helping those
                discriminated against is a band-aid, it doesn’t make sure that the structural empoverishment ends. Sanders policies take a first step to actually doing that. This is why MLK tied race to economics so strongly by the end of
                the 60s.

                He hasn’t disowned his son, his son is working on his campaign. The “catering” of his message is aimed at winning votes, his message appeals to all demographics, because it is true. His policies are stronger in their benefit
                to the Black community, and he also targets institutional racism directly, while Clinton panders to it. I can’t understand the voting pattern, except in a very cynical way, which to put it bluntly says “A Jew won’t win”.

                in the civil rights era. The message is not being sold with traditional Democratic factional politics, this is true, but this is a plus for getting elected, not a minus.

                You are forced to do business with a company you hate when that company acquires monopoly position. I am forced to buy internet from Time-Warner. There is no other choice, they drove everyone else out of the market. If I
                lived in certain communities, I would be forced to buy at WalMart. I cannot shop for clothes at small providers anymore because they have been suppressed by the Gap, Urban Outfitters and so on.

                I already fled to New York, because it was pretty much the last place in the US you could go to and still avoid the large businesses. Now it is going too, the last decade has been terrible for New York business. Rents have
                been driven up by chains and national retailers in order to bankrupt the small businesses on the same block. Now huge chunks of Broadway and Columbus Avenues are gone to the dark side, and I can no longer shop there.

                There are real market failures, the most obvious of which are the people sleeping on the streets of my city, people whose labor is useful, and who can contribute in thousands of ways, but their labor is superfluous. The
                reason is simply that the economy has concentrated wealth, and does not generate demand sufficient to employ everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a further market failure in monopolistic business, the kind that delivers internet in the US. France gets twice the speed at a third the cost, as do other nations with a sensible telecommunications competition
                policy. The US pioneered this in 1996, it was part of the telecom act to have competitive carriers. But Bush allowed it to get remonopolized. The infrastructure and services must be split up, and the service companies must
                be able to rent the infrastructure at an equal rate.
            </p>
            <p>The same policies apply to retail. I don’t care if you choose not to shop at a store, but if you shop at eBay or Amazon, you are supporting even more monstrous monopolies than anything you see in your neighborhood.</p>
            <p>
                I refuse to support monopolistic business, it is a matter of religious injunction for me. That means I actually will be forced to leave the US when New York falls, all my previous hometowns have already fallen to the chain
                cancer. There is no place left to flee in the US, except maybe Vermont.

                You are only right if he loses, and the delegate count is not yet hopeless. There is still a path going forward, especially considering his extremely strong and surprising showings in Minnesota, Oklahoma, and especially
                surprising Colorado. He won those states at levels that approach or exceed his New Hampshire win, Colorado by 20 points, Minnesota by 22 points, after close polling, and with extremely strong turnout.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sanders will not win the southern black vote, this is becoming clear, for whatever reason, I won’t speculate. But it is clear that he can win big with everyone else, including Hispanics out West, black voters outside the
                South, and that’s a lot of people altogether. So if he wins the rest of the country by the margins he showed he can get in Minnesota and Colorado, he wins the whole thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s much harder without the support of black folks down south, this is true, but there seems to be a real roadblock there that can’t be overcome. Perhaps it is due to the Clinton’s long history in the region, perhaps it is
                due to the Christian fundamentalism that poisons the whole region. I don’t know, but it is possible to win still, so one must fight on.

                There is more than one road to tyranny, and the one that America is most in danger of doesn’t lead down the path of total government control. It ends with enormous corporations running the entire economy, and controlling the
                form and type of government through their financial dealings. This is just as dangerous a tyranny, it is the fascist type.
            </p>
            <p>
                The George W. Bush years were the worst for fascist measures, you had surveillance and state repression, the fourth amendment was ignored, dissidents were actively recorded and spied on, and 9/11 truthers were threatened
                with charges of supporting terrorism (it wasn’t so long ago, please try to remember). The government itself became a servant to Halliburton, and awarded multimillion dollar contracts for Iraqi bases with showers that didn’t
                work, and for mercenaries that committed atrocities on the battlefield.
            </p>
            <p>
                Socialism is just a method of identifying and correcting market failures, because those failures are real. The failures are due to concentration of ownership, and the charging of rent, leading to an economy which is
                stagnant, because nobody can get financing for a new idea, nor can anyone get an education or own a house, because they are forced into low wage jobs and debt peonage.
            </p>
            <p>
                The path to correcting these failures can be the state-path, where the state confiscates all property, and then you end up with monstrous states that control the entire economic production and are even more inefficient than
                what they replaced. But it can also follow the libertarian path, what used to be called “anarchism”, before that meant purple hair and a safety-pin in your nose. The type of socialism that American socialists talk about
                involves workers owning more capital, small farmers and small manufacturers independently working and supporting one another, industries being less dependent on special government contracts, and the social ideal of a market
                that doesn’t concentrate wealth at the top. This is not easy to make happen, the natural state is an oligarchy with a handful of Morgans and Rockefellers and Rothchilds ruling over everyone else.

                Bernie Sanders isn’t even talking about socialism, just social democracy. His politics also aim to save small business from monopolistic competition. If you don’t want every store in your neighborhood to be a McDonald’s a

                wouldn’t have won the second time if he had been a communist the first time, as communists are not popular when in office. The claim that Nicaragua was communist was nonsense in the 1980s American press, nonsense which
                Sanders called out. Not that Nicaragua was a picnic in 85, but it wasn’t anything like the USSR in economic policy.

                Oh boy. I don’t know. I hope to God he isn’t serious about the racist crap he says on the campaign trail, but I think he would be a bigoted son-of-a-bitch anyway, and he wouldn’t know what a civil-liberties violation looked
                like if it smacked him on the head. The only positive thing I can say about him is that he is the first to squarely blame Bush for 9/11 (although not in the usual way, he is not a truther, but he associates with them
                sometimes), so it follows that there is a chance that he might investigate Bush administration officials for war crimes. He might not. I think it’s 50/50. But I think that’s as good a chance as you have with Sanders. That’s
                the only point of sanity I can see in his otherwise repulsive campaign, but it’s a biggie. I believe voters in the US are sick of being manipulated by absurd lies.

                They are not united in Australia, they just have a cleaner legislature. All of Sanders’ policies are poll-tested with ordinary Americans, and they all have a majority. Health care is the least universally popular, at 52%,
                but it’s still a majority. You are too used to a Congress that doesn’t listen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clinton tried to pass universal care, it’s true. So did Truman and Nixon. But the experience with Obamacare has made it clear that nothing else will work, and, paraphrasing Churchill, Americans only do the right thing after
                trying everything else first.

                Sanders’ money-raising power scares the bejeesus out of Congressional candidates (disclosure: I am responsible for .0004% of his campaign) . With the ability to raise 40 million in 1 month, he can steamroller any individual
                opponent out of Congress or the Senate in any election, by simply pumping money into the race. If you think this is not a motivator, I will point you to the success record of the NRA.

                out of that), but it’s no good. The same about pressing charges against the White House travel staff. It’s legal. It’s just incredibly corrupt, and should be disqualifying. The same about blaming the Benghazi attack on a

                His plans are on his website. College is cheap, and is covered by a transaction tax, which is required to end microtrading anyway. Health care is expensive, but your taxes will be less than the sum of your and your
                employer’s health care bill, at least if you are not a millionaire. Both plans are implemented in Australia which outranks the US in the Heritage Foundation’s measures of economic freedom (Australia comes in at no 5).

                Guantanamo is a terror tactic, there is no guarantee that citizens will not suffer. It violates international conventions for treatment of POWs too. Sanders is similar to Rand Paul, except his vision is to aim monetary
                policy at zeroing out unemployment. Unlike Paul, he is a Keynesian, meaning he understands economics. Paul is not a Keynesian, so he doesn’t understand economics.

                There is no serious expansion of government in Sanders plan, the health care is a payment reshuffling that reduces bureaucracy, while the transaction tax on Wall St. is required to halt microtrading (which is really a form
                of computerized fraud). The college stuff is about payment to state and city universities, it doesn’t require picking winners and losers.

            <p>
                The Soviet labor system was not slave labor, people could choose their jobs, the salary was set by administrators using heavy incentives to draw the right number of people in to difficult positions. Actually, the labor
                system was a hidden pure free market, as the planners were operating by supply and demand (although nobody in the USSR would admit it). This labor system was set up in the mid 1930s, and under this system, unemployment went
                to zero, and never came back. That was the one of the only successes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The labor system was not amenable to foreign investment, but the USSR did all the heavy industry themselves, oil, steel, natural resources, nuclear, etc, so the only investment they desperately needed was small business.
                This was not possible within the Soviet system, and it hampered independent devlopment, and destroyed consumer goods. Yugoslavia did much better in this regard.

                You are impossibly dense then, if you don’t recognize the recursive structure in natural language. I learned generative grammar as a small child, from specifications of computer languages. It’s dead easy to specify natural
                language grammars using it, for toy languages. For real languages, one needs an extension of BNF, which is something I made up as an adult— the commutative context free grammar (another person in Poland made it up at the
                same time for other reasons, and he called it “partially commutative context free grammar”, and didn’t apply it to natural language, just studied it theoretically).
            </p>
            <p>
                The point is that generative grammar is here to stay, if only for the structure description of artificial languages. But in the “partially commutative” form, it describes natural language to a tee. This is something you are

                Chomsky is dead on accurate on Israel. I am a Jew born in Israel, I have experience. There is no double standard, Israel has behaved badly since 1967, they weren’t atrocious before then, despite the horrible ethnic
                cleansing, since they were forced to balance the needs of millions of Jewish refugees with that of native people, but they weren’t great in 1948 either. But since 1980, when the Likud took over and decided to treat the
                occupied land as permanently occupied, they have been committing war crime after war crime, and since 1987, I believe it is impossible to serve in the Israeli military without selling your soul to the devil.

            <p>
                You are right! Western scientists are stupid about this still. This is a demonstration of the corruption of Western science. Oil is abiotic, that’s a fact of nature, and it is demonstrated by oil in deep boreholes 10km down,
                in the USSR and in Vietnam, by He dissolved in oil (the He is produced from alpha decay in the mantle), by the chemistry of formation demonstrated in pressure anvil experiments first performed in the USSR (methane is
                unstable to form hydrocarbon chains in the mantle) and reproduced in the West by Thomas Gold in the 1990s, again in the 2000s, and again last year. Each of these by themselves is conclusive evidence. The Soviets were right
                about this, which is why the Russians and Ukrainians are the only ones still who know anything about oil formation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two points of evidence in favor of biology are extremely weak: there are trace biological markers in oil, a few proteins, these are due to deep Earth bacteria and archaea, and there is carbon isotope segregation in oil,
                which is not due to biological origin, but due to percolation a long distance through narrow channels (this was an isotope separation method at Los Alamos incidentally). These are the only two pieces of evidence which
                support biogenic theory, and they are both extremely weak. There is no chemical path from living chemistry to oil, the historical path goes the other way— life is originated in petrochemical hydrocarbons in contact with
                atmospherically generated amino-acid chains in the early Earth.

                is not about political cronyism, his policy is sincere, and he can easily win a significant number of non-ideologue Republicans.

                Infinite growth is possible because labor is not just about producing material things, it is also about producing software, film, music, books, designs, pictures, and other commodities whose resource requirements are
                relatively negligible. There is also growth in applying recycling techniques, and extracting energy from nuclear sources, which are unused by nature.

                The same institutions that have no ethical system are driven purely by profit, and can be controlled by profit using economical prods set up by law. It is not sensible to argue that profit is an unethical motive, it is
                simply a motive of economic efficiency without consideration for those aspects which must be imposed externally as a system of costs and constraints, to prevent environmental destruction and to prevent concentration of
                ownership.

                These measures are not being implemented today, I believe this is because there is no consensus on what measures need to be implemented. I think that must change quickly, so that we can concentrate on passing the measures
                which ensure sustainable growth. The problems of environmental destruction are not solved by a socialist revolution, as the leaders of a socialist state are no less motivated by considerations of increased production over
                externalities of pollution.

                You mean Ilya Prigogine. The theory of strange attractors, bifurcations, and chaotic dynamical systems is not very useful for economics or sociology, except as a source of loose analogy, because societies are complex
                computational systems, not simple dynamical systems. Within economic behavior, there are dynamical systems which can be analyzed this way, but they are better analyzed in terms of “we do this, and then this happens” marginal
                analysis rather than in terms of cycles and response, because they are either simple responses or unanalyzable complex human systems.

                I don’t believe in 60 year cycles, or cycles of any sort. Schumpeter is writing a long time ago, before the random walk and Levy flight aspects of markets were introduced (that was the late 60s, by Mandelbrot and others).
                The idea of cycles is problematic, although there are certain cyclical things, they are better modelled as stochastic bubble-bust (which is not a cycle, although it is a predictable collapse). The idea of “cycle” implies
                inertia, like a mass on a spring, and I don’t see any inertia in markets at all. I would like to see the data regarding the 60 year business, even as a link, I don’t believe it exists.

                I don’t believe in grand theories. I believe in fixing the problems that appear. I don’t think there is anything wrong with the economic doctrine of market equilibrium, and it will never be replaced as long as humans have
                economies, because it is just an allocation prescription. It doesn’t dictate that the few must control the many, it actually shows you the opposite.

                That’s an theory regarding political systems. I don’t have an opinion or a theory regarding political systems, they are too complicated for me to claim to understand, and I don’t think Wallerstein understands them so well
                either, there is very little you can do to test these theories, unlike in economics, where you can measure inflation and growth, and unemployment. I trust quantitative predictions more than vague social ones, although I
                understand that vague social things are necessary too. I just don’t care about that stuff. I care about predicting numbers accurately.

                The theoretical model of market equilibrium is a real mathematical thing, it’s as real as any other mathematical construction. It can be analyzed independent of power structures, because it is objective and mathematical. You
                can make up computerized fake simulated economies and study how they respond to perturbations. It has merit, because it tells you how much resources to allocate to any one industry independent of political considerations,
                just from the demand generated, and the price per unit in equilibrium, and the profitability at equilibrium. It’s just that markets in real life are always terribly far from the idealized equilibrium due to the ownership
                structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea of using market equilibrium for organizing the planned (non-market) economy is something that was advocated by Alexei Kosygin and Alexander Dubcek, and implemented by Tito and Kardelj. Planning by profitability and
                local decisionmaking was the goal of the failed 1965 economic reform in the USSR and of the collapse-inducing 1985 reforms. It is next to impossible to produce this reform within communist party rule, because it requires
                independent decision making and purchases at the local level, and this conflicts with the power of the nomenklatura to direct overall economic planning. The failure of these reforms, and all other attempts, are what led to
                widespread justified belief that a communist party revolution cannot end at an efficiently self-directed economy and political liberty.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 1965 reforms were difficult to implement because the state directors kept skimming enterprise profits for big projects, while even the enterprises that got to keep enough capital that should have had capital for
                expansion weren’t able to get construction or machinery for their expansions justified by their profitability, because they were not embedded in an economy of small independent businesses that could fill their orders. But
                even with the supply limitations induced by the lousy economy they were embedded in, the enterprise growth under the half-hearted reforms was still better than the top-down planned monstrosity that existed in the USSR pre
                1965 and in 1970-1985, when the reforms were reversed.

                I don’t have patience for philosophy or theorizing. The problems of the left are problems of economic efficiency and innovation, problems which are largely solved in capitalism, at least when it isn’t dominated by large
                monopolistic firms. The problems of capitalism is in concentrating ownership to a few, producing monopolistic firms, which end up paying unfair wages far below productivity, and overall demand drops from the low wages. The
                band-aid for this failure is Keynesian spending. The real fix is employee ownership and systemic anti-trust policy in a graduated corporate tax.

                responsible for blaming it on a video on YouTube, a video that had nothing to do with the attack, as everyone inside the administration knew, it was for a prisoner swap. This was leaked by Petraeus’s girlfriend. She then
                went on to call for censorship of YouTube because of this. That does not add up to an honest politician, it is impossible to support her and support clean government.

                It also matters how persuasive Sanders is. His moderate gun stance, his unwavering support of civil liberties, and his strong support of small business from monopolistic competition, these given him enormous credibility with

                The reason Sanders compares college loans to secured loans is because college loans are guaranteed by the Federal government for years, and represent no risk to the lender. They are secured by the Federal government. The
                interest rates, however, have not gone down to reflect this fact. That means you need to step in and make sure that it happens anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
                Loans for credit cards and college are being given at usurious rates, due to consolidation in banking and credit. There is no competition for lending rates since the 90s, when all the banks raised their credit-card rates in
                tandem to 20%. Credit cards used to be competitive, they aren’t any longer. Payday lending is not a competitive industry, and it is charging outrageous rates to those that can least afford to be paying them. This is why
                postal banking is important, and why Sanders has proposed to introduce this in the US.

                The decrease in transactions in the Wall St. tax is taken into account. Part of the reason for the tax is to eliminate the fraud of microtrading, where a broker sets up a server a few microseconds closer to the trading
                floor, and intercepts requests for purchase early, and pre-empts them by a purchase and resell at a few pennies more. This process is one of the worst frauds in markets, and it is eliminated entirely by even the tiniest tax
                on transactions. The income from the transaction tax is estimated at between $100 bn and $200bn depending on which transactions survive, it is far bigger than $200bn if you assume nothing changes, but nobody does that. The
                public college thing costs $70bn, there would be money left over under any reasonable estimate of the effects.

                Minimum wage is not about cost of living, it is about closing the gap between productivity and wages. It cannot be addressed locally, because corporations flee from a region with higher minimum wage to a region with a lower

                The TRUE “wage productivity gap” arises from innovation in industries with potential for growth. That true gap is allocated to growth in the industry until the innovation is spread around to the entire sector. The FALSE
                “wage productivity gap” is due to crummy wages, and this is the margin of the wealthiest people in America, the Walton family. There is nothing innovative about WalMart, it is the opposite of innovation. There is nothing
                innovative in traditional oil and natural gas, they are innovation killers, they don’t even accept that oil is abiotic. The companies with the largest profits are in old industry today, or in monopolized communication, or in

                Marx’s observation is that the violation of Say’s law comes from competition with the unemployed, and it is true whenever you have unemployment. The unemployement means that employees cannot negotiate a wage equal to
                productivity, because they are afraid of getting fired and replaced by someone desperate, and that means that Say’s law is a complete fantasy in any real economy. That’s why Keynesian measures are needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no innovation explanation for the productivity gap, there is no equilibrium explanation for the gap, it is purely due to the fact that ownership is concentrated, profits are extracted at the top, and there is no
                bargaining power for employees at the bottom to negotiate a fair wage, because of threats of firing individual workers who negotiate, and nowadays threats to worker collectives of shutting down plants and moving overseas.

            <p>
                Marx agreed with you that corporate profits would fall to zero, because he also understood equilibrium economics. This is a mistake you both made. Marx couldn’t foresee that governments would step in to shore up aggregate
                demand with spending and redistribution, and at the same time maintain the skewed distribution of corporate income to the top of a heirarchy. He was writing in 1867.
            </p>
            <p>
                Profits only go to zero in worker owned industries, where workers decide to split the profits after allocating capital for investment. Then the workers have the power to negotiate wages equal to productivity. Profits going
                to zero can also happen in publicly owned companies with strong unions and strong stockholders organizations, because of pressure from the public stock owners to redistribute profits to the stockholding public through stock
                buybacks and/or dividends. But this shareholder power is negated by the ability of managers to issue new stock or low-cost options to themselves, which is really something that should be illegal, as it is a form of fraud by
                devaluation.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have never seen a market where Say’s law is true, and this is the reason Keynesian measures are used. With a transition to employee ownership and a competitive management recruited by resume and paid in salary, you would
                have the type of market you are thinking about. But this market resembles voluntary libertarian anarchic socialism, with worker ownership and distribution of profits, in conjunction with public corporations with diffuse
                ownership and public distribution of profits, more than any previously existing capitalism. That’s what economic equilibrium looks like.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no chance of Say’s law ever becoming true in any other kind of ownership structure. The violations of Say’s law are mainstream economics, and as I said, it requires willful suspension of disbelief, and ignoring a
                mountain of quantitative data, to blind yourself like this. I don’t want to have a conversation with someone who chooses to blind himself, so I’ll bid you a good day.

                There were hundreds or perhaps a thousand or two of unregistered caucusgoers for Hillary, that’s the surest sign of election fraud there is in a caucus, you can’t rig a caucus any other way, the people in the room serve as
                an automatic audit. You can see these unregistered Clinton people appear in videos, this stuff was all over social media on the caucus day, and has been reported in several newspapers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way the fraud was done is that the unions supporting Clinton arranged for paid time off to caucus, the Sanders supporters had to arrange for time off themselves. They then got everyone to the location regardless of
                qualification for voting in Nevada, the folks included illegals and out-of-staters for all we know, they were unregistered, and they made sure they all supported Clinton. These people were placed in the caucus room to skew
                the result, and amounted to a large fraction of the caucusgoers, more than enough to reverse the official results.This was combined with the usual nonsense of long lines for Sanders people, deliberate push-registering for
                Clinton,miscounts, etc.

                Nonsense. In 2008, the Democratic nomination was the only contest period. A lot of independents were out voting in the open Democratic primaries and caucuses, now they are split between Trump voters going to the Republicans
                and Sanders supporters going to the Democrats. The turnout was exceedingly high outside of Nevada, where it was deliberately suppressed and the counting skewed. Trump supporters are flaky celebrity-chasers, so you don’t know
                what they’ll do.

                Not really. The health care taxes are probably less than what you are paying in premiums. The college is coming from a transaction tax which is necessary for other reasons, and the jobs program is coming from corporate
                taxes, it’s really a redirect of corporate welfare to jobs. Sanders is very careful about not overtaxing people. He is really determined to reduce bureaucracy. I mean it when I say he’s a libertarian. He’s just a
                left-libertarian.

                There hasn’t been a capitalism functioning without Keynesian stimulus since the 1930s. The Keynesian interventions are really based on a theory of “aggregate demand” which is really straight out of Marx. I mean, not that
                Keynesianism is Marxism, but the concept of aggregate demand stimulus is derived from the observation of Marx that worker wages don’t generate sufficient demand for the products they produce.

                Sanders has no chance, but then again, the US has no chance either, because that stuff doesn’t work.

                Reagan was sane on science, unlike Bush II, he preserved civil liberties more or less, unlike Bush II, and he wasn’t completely owned by corporations, unlike Bush II. But his policies were only benefiting large entities, not
                small business. I don’t think Reagan was a catastrophe, because the US needed investment, but I think his legacy is problematic, as his economic doctrine is simply false, and it has become dogma in the Republican party.

                especially terrible, as they are structurally more biased to distort the events of the late 80s, because they all hate communism (with reason). But it doesn’t help to have ideological historians, even if their ideology comes
                with justification, as they are talking about a system that made their lives miserable for 70 years.

                Yes I do. The increases in budget were relatively small compared to the US arms buildup. The budget wouldn’t have helped had it been all thrown into agriculture— Soviet agriculture was crappy because it was state managed
                top-down, the same reason Soviet everything was crappy, except science and big industry, which are top-down in the West as well.

                Russia was producing missiles at the same stupid plodding pace it always did, until the START treaties. Nothing changed in spending with Reagan, the only thing that changed is that the Soviets became incredibly paranoid that

                He did very little to change Russian spending on anything, that’s a conservative myth, which began propagating in the mid 90s. You people never read internal Soviet documents, I did, in the late 80s, when they were current
                (I think I was the only one, actually, they’re very boring). The USSR was restructured in 1986 or so to allow market oriented profit-based self-allocations in state industries. This immediately led to shortages, because the
                industries were all monopolies, so they would just jack up the price to meet profit quotas. This led to grumbling, and further reform, and the system was so unstable from the decades of repression, that it collapsed by
                itself. Reagan happened to be the guy in charge when it happened, or more accurately, Bush I.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Soviet system could not sustain itself because it was grossly inefficient. Gorbachev knew this because he was in charge of Ukraine farming in the politburo, and he was aware of the productivity gap between the factory
                farms in the USSR and Western agriculture. He was introducing market reforms to close the gap. Those reforms were originally suggested in 1965, but people didn’t listen inside the USSR, because they were worred that the
                system would collapse. They were right. The moment there were free-markets, there were folks like Yeltsin who supported the free-marketeers, and they dismantled the system and privatized the state industries at the first
                chance they got, creating the Russian oligarchy practically overnight in 1991.

                Nicaragua wasn’t communist in the 80s, any more than it is communist now. Ortega was more authoritarian in the 80s, but the opposition was a bunch of US funded Contras, and Pinochet style fascists that enjoyed pulling

                The Iran Contra affair justified Bernie Sanders’ position completely. Reagan’s administration was using dirty money not authorized by Congress to finance the Contras without congressional approval. It’s the same covert

                The nuclear freeze movement was trying to prevent the Reagan administration from placing missiles in Europe that could reach Moscow in about seven minutes. The existence of Pershing II missiles in Europe nearly made me lose
                my mind, at age 10, 11, 12, 13, from constant terror of accidental war, until Reagan and Gorbachev got rid of them. Haing a five-minute retaliation time was Reagan taking a tremendous and monumentally stupid risk of the end
                of the world for next to no gain for anyone. That’s something else that’s clearer in hindsight.

                In 1980 a million people marched in New York City, in the largest demonstration in US history, against the nuclear arms race, and Reagan’s beligerant attitude toward the USSR. In Europe, 4 million nuclear freeze activists
                were marching at one point. They were the only light at the end of the tunnel regarding the awful inexcusable cold war tensions of the 80s, which unlike the tensions of the 60s, were simply caused by a single irresponsible
                person— Reagan. I would recommend you take a look at the made for TV film “Threads” to get a sense of my nightly childhood dreams (it’s a bit milder than the horrors that a 10 year old subconscious produced in 1983, but it’s
                the general ballpark).

                It was impossible to be a leftist in the 80s without meeting Marxists. It was impossible actually to avoid meeting Marxists in any capacity, they were everywhere. The difference in the left is that they didn’t have the
                illusion that the communists had some sort of special secret sauce, or were going to take over the world. The left and the communists parted ways largely in 1956, with the Hungarian revolution.

                Anyone who reviews what Reagan and his government was doing with the Contras can see that he was right about this. He was not a Marxist Leninist, but he respected the right of self-determination in Nicaragua. Ortega was
                reelected president recently, as a moderate Christian, rather than as a Marxist. Ortega disputed that he was a Marxist Leninist even back in the 80s, that was just the label the media in the US stuck on him.

                That’s nonsense. Reducing income inequality increases economic growth, that’s why the high taxes of the 1950s were adopted in the first place. The reason to tax very high incomes is because there are no high incomes in
                economic equilibrium, the kind you read about in textbooks on economics.

                and then asking for YouTube censorship because of this bogus claim. Are these things illegal? Not really. But they certainly are not good things, and they don’t make one confident in voting for a candidate.

                FDR did not prolong the depression, that’s an insane right wing lie. The Keynesian policies FDR introduced were done more fully and completely in England, in Italy, in Germany, and they ended the depression immediately
                wherever they were implemented with zeal. In the US, it took a decade for the Republicans to stop obstructing these measures, and only the war allowed Roosevelt to implement full employment through armaments productions
                (lend-lease helped). The war spending was a stimulus also, except it was passed by necessity. The same Keynesian policies were used in the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s, and in part in the 1990s, and were used overseas in
                every modern economy. There is no sense in denying the efficacy of Keynesian measures, it is a denial of economic fact. As Eisenhower said, “there are a few people who deny these things, but their numbers are small, and they
                are stupid”. Unfotunately, their numbers have grown since Eisenhowers’ time, and they now control one of the two major political parties.

                This is incorrect. Increasing minimum wage increases hiring and spending. The process must be tied in with foreign trade negotiations which raise wages overseas, to allow an expanding market for domestic goods which are
                exported, and this Sanders also promised to fight for. There is no substitute for this, otherwise the economy is distorted forever.

                That’s nonsense. He isn’t proposing to raise taxes beyond 1984 levels, that was already rather low, as it was after the first round of Reagan tax cuts. The flattening of the tax beyond that point has been counterproductive,
                and even the original flattening is not useful anymore, as we have plenty of investment capital, just very few opportunities to find new demand.

                Regarding the economy, Sanders is aware of the bad shape we are in, and will take larger steps than Obama has taken. Republicans are incapable of doing anything about it, because they don’t understand the fundamental laws of

                state, illegal, whatever. These were not isolated events. There were long lines in Sanders districts, there were too few registration forms, there were organized union supporters packed in, and STILL Hillary only won by the
                slimmest of margins. Most of this is Harry Reid’s fault, but in any case, it shows you that the establishment must be defeated.

                It’s no more of a pretense than Eisenhower running as a Republican, or even Trump running as a Republican today. His independent past is part of why I respect him, and likewise Eisenhower. Eisenhower’s policies departed from
                Republican dogma where it mattered— he financed highway spending and stimulus. Sanders departs from Democratic party dogma on surveillance and intrusions on privacy, and on fine-tuned targeted tax breaks. His policies are
                best-possible because of the independence. His party affiliation, however, is clearly appropriate, just as Eisenhower’s was, and Trump’s is.

                First, Saul Alinsky was not a communist either. He was a “New Left” guy who was organizing to produce political power for leftist politicians. This type of nanny-leftism, with it’s pet causes and constituencies, led people
                to lose sight of the fundamental economic insights of the left, which is Keynesianism and loss of economic equilibrium.
            </p>
            <p>Sanders is a hard-headed Keynesian, and he is not running on an Alinsky platform. The closest to an Alinsky Democrat is probably Obama actually.</p>
            <p>
                Hillary Clinton was only schmoozing around with Alinsky and leftists because she sensed that this is the key to getting into power. Her actual policies have not been particularly on the left at any point. She supports or
                opposes corporate policies depending only on who is giving her money, and whether other people are paying attention or not, see bankruptcy reform.

                All the stuff you linked is hysterical propaganda that misses that Clinton has never been on the real left. It is not clear that Alinsky was either. The place to go for real left stuff is Chomsky, who is the furthest left

                alternative for moderate reformists in a system like in the US, that’s the way it works. Parliamentary systems are a little better, but not by much, and there are problems in those systems too, due to the outsize influence
                of small coalition members preventing decisive action by the plurality party. There is no perfect system, I know that. But the current economic situation is an emergency. There has not been a healthy growth in small business
                since the late 90s.

                I believe that Sanders’ policies ensure that the politicians won’t control the economy, as they are uniform, and he is not beholden to corporate backers to pass special tax-breaks and incentives. This is what leads to the
                corruption.

                I understand you point about long-term unemployed, and I include them as “unemployed”. Sanders does this too. He is aware that the growth in jobs of the last years is in low-paying corporate retail jobs, which pay $26,000.
                This is why you need strong policy to fix the concentration of retail business, the concentration of banking, the concentration of communications, and Sanders is really your only hope for this.

                Sanders is not proposing any squeeze of the middle tax. His only tax on the middle class is contingent on a health care plan that ends up saving you money.<br />
                If the plan doesn’t pass, nothing happens to your taxes. He is a serious candidate, and his policies are serious policies. Please read them, and think about their effect on unemployment.

                The US health care system is terrible, as anyone who has ever been treated outside the US knows. I got better treatment in Hong Kong. The reason is that doctors here have a perverse incentive to over-prescribe and over test,
                and they get paid for it by a third party whose hands are tied. The only reasonable part of the US system is cash-practice, but this is hardly affected by a shift to single payer. Single payer is just to ensure that you
                aren’t held hostage to a hospital which decides what they will do to you, and then bills your insurance as much as they want. This is a disgraceful situation. My daughter went to the hospital with croup when she was 2 (a
                very common condition), and she was subjected to a battery of tests, one every 15 minutes, until I finally stepped in to say “no more”. This type of behavior is disgraceful, and it is what the US system is all about. It’s
                simply a way to soak insurance companies and the public.

                His policies have never been passed in the US. They are tried outside the US, in every other modernized nation, and they work everywhere they are tried. The Australian minimum wage is $17, in Finland, college is not just
                free, they pay you to go to college, and that’s how Finland produced Linux. Public health care is standard around the world except for the US, and the US has the worst system of any modern nation by far. These policies are
                long overdue, and if you avoid them now, it is doubtful that the US can stay competitive in the future.

                from a higher median income than the US, despite GDP per capita lower.

                While some of the nonsense about Hillary is coming from right-wing sources, some of it is not. The “travelgate” scandal is an example of a real problem— she had bogus charges pressed against the White House travel staff in
                the 90s. That’s not illegal, but it’s not good either, and I don’t want to vote for her. That’s not made up, the travel guy went to court to prove his innocence and succeeded. She is not responsible for the Benghazi attack,
                but she did blame the attack on a video on YouTube, and then called for internet censorship. That’s not illegal either, but it’s unethical, considering that everyone in the administration knew the attack was for a prisoner
                swap, as leaked by Petraeus’s girlfriend. She was responsible for Ukraine meddling which supported a far-right neo-Nazi coup, which preceded the Russian invasian and led to it, she supported a coup in Honduras, her policy in
                Libya was destabilizing and no good. Sanders is a clean candidate, Hillary simply isn’t, no matter how much the far-right embellishes her misdeeds.

                Health care reform is about reducing costs of health care by at least 50%, to bring it in line with spending in other countries, like Norway and Australia, which beat the US in economic freedom according to the Heritage
                Foundation, hardly a liberal mouthpeice. There is no excuse for the lousy US health care system, a public minimum insurance, plus private supplemental insurance, gets you all the beneifts of both public and private systems

                I know Bernie Sanders’ politics very well, having followed him vaguely since the late 80s. He is not about state-takeovers of the economy, nor is he about handouts. He is very good for independent small business, for small
                farmers, and for restoring competition to industries that are monopolized. He has no handouts as part of his policy, he is not a handouts kind of guy. He is about reducing unemployment through sensibly designed policy that
                mimics that in Australia, which ranks higher than the US in the Heritage Foundation’s economic freedoms index. He intends on refocusing the economy away from enormous monopolies, and renegotiating trade agreements so that
                they improve wages overseas, and protect employees in the US. These are essential reforms, they needed to happen in the 90s, not today.

                independent, not a Democrat. The people backing him as a presidential candidate back him as a Democrat. If he doesn’t get the nomination, I expect him to go right back to being an independent Senator.

                Bernie Sanders is not a state-takeover guy. There are hardly any socialists like that in the US, even on the far left. He is less meddlesome than most Democrats and Republicans, as he does not have special interest money
                pulling his strings for special tax exemptions and subsidies. His record with small farmers and businesses in Vermont is very strong, and he has protected important businesses from political shutdown, even when it came from

            </p>
            <p>
                His politics are about supporting the middle class from predations of large power structures, and preserving the rights of small business to compete in an environment free of monopoly power, as explained by Franklin Delano
                Roosevelt. This type of FDR Democrat is not seen anymore, Sanders is one of the handful left.

                Keynesianism explains unemployment as a result of misallocation of what should be wages at equilibrium to corporate profits. When wages are not sufficient, demand is too low, and unemployment happens. Keynes wasn’t allowed
                to say that, because that’s straight out of Marx’s mouth. So only “post-keynesians” say that. But Kenyes (and everybody else in 1934) knew that, because they all knew their Marx.

                Your interpretation of what I said is confused nonsense. Please read a book. “Naive self interest” is the exact same thing as “rational self interest”. It is naive, because a uniform minimum wage helps all businesses through

                The failed predictions are from the Chicago school. They predict rising unemployment in response to rising minimum wage. The opposite is seen. They predicted tripling of prices in 2008, nothing happened aside from
                business-as-usual inflation of a few percent. These predictions are as wrong as Aristotle’s predictions for falling bodies.

                The Chicago school quacks also willfully misinterpret Keynesianism to add “Philips curve” and “NAIRU” voodoo to it, so they can attack it. Economics must stop being a poiticized field. It’s a quantitative predictive
                endeavor, and those who predict numbers correctly must be listened to, and those who predict wrong numbers must be ignored.

                I read “Dreams from my Father”, and Obama’s views are nothing like any socialist’s of any kind. He’s basically a moderate centrist Democrat, working with Democrats who are fundamentally moderate Republicans in their views.
                The view of Federal mandates was worse under Bush, who started intrusive surveillance and imprisonment policies, and move to a police state. Obama has simply moved to try to implement stimulus, and was prevented from doing
                so by congress, in a cynical attempt to “make the American economy scream”, so as to produce consensus against Democrats. This type of action against the national interest is inconcievable in a major political party, and
                means they don’t deserve anyone’s vote.

                There’s some fraud, but the public opinion polls and exit polls keep it from departing from public consensus too much. I know this, because there is a long history of voting in these primaries, and the superdelegates are
                simply a tool to demoralize voters in intermediate stages. They are unable to do anything significant in the end, because they are beholden to the same voters, and the same voters revolt if the superdelegates vote against
                the popular will.

                That’s “popular economics”, it has no relation to real economics. The fact is that without Keynesianism, Capitalism exerts a downward force on everybody. The economies of the postwar consensus produced a lot of wealthy
                people, and the economies of Reaganomics only produce concentrations of industry and monopolies.

                OF COURSE minimum wage is against the naive interest of both small and large business! They would like to pay as little as possible. When there is a state with a $15 minimum wage and another state with a $10 minimum wage,
                they will relocate whenever they can!
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason that minimum wage works ANYWAY is because the wage structure is not in economic equilibrium. In equilibrium, the worker is supposed to be negotiating a wage equal to his or her productivity, no matter what the
                position! The reason that this works is because in equilibrium, there is no unemployment, so anyone paying too little can’t find anyone to work for them.
            </p>
            <p>
                That doesn’t happen in real markets, because there is no real competition for ownership positions. These are divided at a higher level, nobody asks for resumes to fill the position of CEO of GM,let alone do they take lowest
                competent bid. Nobody competes with Facebook, or Google in any meaningful way, reducing their profits.
            </p>
            <p>
                This means that the equilibrium is broken, there are non-competitive compensations. That means conversely that there is less demand in the labor market than there would be in equilibrium, and therefore unemployment. This
                stuff is very hard for you, because you are unable to understand that global equilibrium is VERY FAR AWAY from what you see around you, even though each small-scale local economic transaction looks like a local negotiation
                at supply and demand intersection. That’s not true for the economy as a whole, because it is not really true for owners, and it is certainly not true when a worker has to demand wage at nonzero unemployment.
            </p>
            <p>
                At nonzero unemployment, without minimum wage, the lowest wages collapse to subsistence, and all the demand from those workers essentially vanishes. This is why minimum wage brings you closer to equilibrium, because in
                equilibrium, nobody is forced to work for below their productivity, which in reality is always far far beyond minimum wage.
            </p>
            <p>
                One way to ensure that all employees are getting an equilibrium wage is to take all the corporate profits and divide them among all the employees according to their decision on what to keep, and what to invest in growing the
                company, leaving the management with a salary negotiated by bid and competition. That’s what happens in a worker-owned business, and in an economy with worker owned business, you can imagine an actual economic equilibrium
                without any government intervention. The reason is that economic equilibrium does not allow for serious inequality, beyond some small amount related to personal hours invested and personal productivity. This is why the
                equilibrium mathematical model does not have anything much to do with real markets.
            </p>

                voting for Trump. The turnout Sanders gets is very good, except in Nevada, where it was suppressed deliberately by long lines, and the voting was marred by fraud (unregistered Clinton caucusgoers). This type of election
                fraud is very worrying, as it was not small and incidental, as in Iowa, but it seems to have been organized by the Clinton-supporting unions, in conjunction with Harry Reid.

                The type of “socialism” Sanders advocates is purely “more freedom”. He and Ron Paul see eye to eye on the Patriot act and the constitution. His economic policies are not interventionist in the sense of picking winners and
                losers, or subsidizing big business, like Obamacare does. He simply has the government reduce bureaucracy as much as possible. Universal health care increases freedom, as it removes a layer of corporate bureaucracy in
                private insurance, and allows you to switch jobs without worrying about taking your care with you. It is not anti-market, because you can always get supplemental insurance. It does not pick winners and losers, because the
                government is simply acting as a billing agency.

            <p>
                Sanders’ Keynsian policies are pro-growth and are the minimal intrusions to restore wage growth. The candidate himself does not take corporate contributions. He is the Libertarian’s best candidate, as he will not favor big
                businesses, as all the other candidates are bound to do by contributions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Libertarianism, despite what you read about in America, was originally developed as an anti-Marxist offshoot of socialism. The goal was to minimize both state and large corporate power at the same time. This is very tricky,
                and Sanders policies are the best possible in this direction. They are aimed at concentrations of private power without unduly increasing state power in such a way as to favor this or that private party. It is difficult for
                a person indoctrinated with Republicanism to understand this, so I’ll just defer to his strong record on constitutional protections, auditing the Fed, avoiding foreign entanglements, and all the other areas of overlap with
                Ron Paul.

                You don’t understand what “socialism” is academically and historically, in economics. The starting idea is that there is a failure in markets to reach market equilibrium, due to unemployment reducing wages below what they
                would be in the theoretical ideal free market. This observation is simply true, it means that there is less “aggregate demand” in the market than what would be the case in a perfect competitive market, where nobody is too
                rich. This observation was first made by Marx in “Capital I”, but nobody gives him credit for it. The reason nobody wants to cite him for this idea is that he wanted the state to seize all industries, and that is not a good
                idea.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nevertheless, the observation that aggregate demand is depressed in markets is simply true, and it is now standard economic lore, at least since Keynes took up the theory, and made it axiomatic that governments need to prop
                up aggregate demand (Keynes made up nonsense explanations for this, because Marx is taboo in economics). The result is that people were able to get out of the depression, by simply hiring people in government jobs, or
                spending government money, to restore economic equilibrium. All economists understand this since the 1930s.
            </p>
            <p>
                This observation is the cornerstone of macroeconomics, and it is fundamentally “socialist” or “Keynesian”, or whatever term you want to use for it. It is a statement that markets are not self-correcting in this respect, when
                aggregate demand is low. The prediction that this theory makes is that when you increase minimum wage (or otherwise stimulate the economy), the unemployment goes DOWN, not up, as you would naively predict, until the minimum
                wage becomes high enough that any further raise produces inflation. There is no way to predict this observed behavior from microeconomics alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point is that there is a serious market failure, which is not due to monopoly exactly, or externalities, just due to labor having to compete with unemployed people, when ownership is concentrated. The Keynesians (FDR,
                Atlee, DeGaulle, Mussolini, Eisenhower, Hitler, Nixon, etc, everyone except Reagan and Bush II) advocate fixing this by reducing unemployment and increasing aggregate demand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bernie Sanders proposes policies which decrease unemployment. The stimulus jobs program decreases unemployment directly, the subsidize college reduces unemployment indirectly, because students don’t compete with the
                employed, and the $15/hr minimum wage reduces unemployment by stimulus (remember the behavior of unemployment and minimum wage in real Keynesian life). In this, he is proposing policies that have been disallowed by the
                political consensus in the US since Reagan decided that Keynesianism is something he doesn’t like.
            </p>
            <p>Sanders is a Keynesian, like all sane economists. There are no other types of economists who are able to predict anything quantitative with any accuracy.</p>

                You simply don’t understand macroeconomics. When you employ everyone, you bring demand up to what it would be in competitive equilibrium, because people can demand higher wages. We are not in competitive equilibrium right
                now, because there are unemployed people, driving down wages for everyone except those who have an inside position with owners of capital.
            </p>
            <p>
                Raising minimum wage must be done at the Federal level, to avoid companies running away across state borders. Now it must be done in conjunction with trade deals, to avoid companies running away across international borders.

                The claim you make about “running at a loss” is known to be false for infrastructure. It is very hard for companies to produce public infrastructure, because it is difficult to recoup the benefit by charging tolls. This is
                why you can have a public works project that brings tremendous benefit which the private sector theoretically should do, but realistically won’t. Whenever a private company owns infrastructure, it is simply for the purpose
                of making a monopoly. For example, the building of wireless towers is designed to produce a monopoly for Verizon. If you want a competitive market, you need to separate the infrastructure from the service, and find a way to
                pay for the infrastructures companies share either by contract or by taxes. That’s what the telecom deregulation act of 1996 did, and it’s what the airline deregulation act of 1979 did. There is no substitute for this.

                Regarding market equilibrium, exactly! It is a state of “perfect competition”, and this idealized state must be held up as the normative ideal, and produced, even in situations when it is difficult to do so. The USSR
                produced this perfect competitive market as far as labor in concerned, and this was their most notable and nearly only success.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sale of labor at perfect competition is not to an owner, because at perfect competition, there is no owner! Everyone is equally laboring. The predictions of perfect market theory is that if person X owns more than you,
                you just go and do what that person is doing, until you own the same amount, and the competition between you and the previous owner drives your competition stake to equality, more or less.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way this is produced in real life is by strong ownership negotiations at point of hire, where you sell your labor to a small company in exchange for a small but growing stake. The ownership becomes widely diffuse, and
                there is no capitalist to exploit you.
            </p>
            <p>
                The aggregation of capital is then only in the businesses themselves, and this is controlled (in the system I described) by the graduated corporate tax, which forces a split in companies for profitability above a certain
                size where maintaining the size is costlier than splitting. Even the smallest graduated tax will produce splits, because companies are perfectly profit-seeking, and have no other consideration.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rest of what I was talking about was contract reform to prevent false-splits, and to prevent concentration of ownership in individuals, and labor reform to prevent unemployment, so that employees are negotiating from a
                position of strength.
            </p>
            <p>
                The “government deed” and “one time exchange” refers to the fact that ownership comes from a government enforcing it, and the exchange that produces a monopoly like Google or Facebook is a one-time IPO, and there are no
                competitors after that one-time act. The capital is granted to Facebook, they become a monopoly, and at no point do they ever face competition. I realized it was poorly worded, and rearranged it.

                Regarding doing science, I know how to do research, thanks. It requires isolation. As Einstein said, “The best job for a theoretical physicist is a lighthouse keeper”. It requires social collaboration also, but not the

                I did review some Marxist and non-Marxist literature, but nothing serious. I don’t think there is too much out there that is serious, because the Marxists don’t understand competitive equilibrium (except Marx), while the
                capitalists don’t understand it any better.

                The Republicans are sometimes sincere, and I believe that all Republicans would rather see a principled and unbought Sanders rather than a crooked Clinton, even if this leads to more policy that they disagree with. It’s not
                like Republicans are attacking Hillary because they want a Republican, they are attacking Hillary because they don’t want a corrupt president. I am not a Republican, and I don’t want a corrupt president either. If this was
                Sanders vs. O’Malley, it wouldn’t be an issue, but it’s not.

                &gt;&gt;&gt; “It’s simply the fact that the competitive stage of capitalism, which seems like a dynamic equilibrium to bourgeois economists, is not stable. It has nothing to do with the “economic equilibrium” resembling
                “idealized anarchic socialism” – that is a utopian vision of society “as it should be” according to you.”
            </p>
            <p>
                All of this is false except the statement about instability. There is a dynamic equilibrium in price markets for commodities, as you can see if you sit down and try to sell anything in a market. If you try and raise the
                price above that of others around you, nobody buys your stuff. If you lower your price, you don’t make enough to justify your time. You have a price imposed on you by the surrounding structure, a price which, in equilibrium,
                more or less exactly compensates you for your labor in acquiring the commodity and finding the buyer.
            </p>
            <p>
                This situation is what defines the microeconomc equilibrium, and it is only unstable to concentrations of capital and power forming. This instability is real, and it is what Marx wrote about. When capitalists aggregate
                ownership into large industries, they can siphon off profits into their pockets, and this is a breaking of equilibrium, and it naturally induces unemployment, and the unemployment induces a collapse of wages for the workers
                in the same industry, who cannot negotiate the equilibrium wage, to subsistence. This is what the 19th century industrial economy looked like, and what every capitalist economy looks like until you adopt Keynesian measures.
            </p>
            <p>
                The breaking of equilibrium is due to the ownership structure, which is not determined by free economic competition exactly, as the compensation of the owner is through the roof. If you ask someone “what salary would you
                take to run Google”, the competent bids would be far less than that of the owners or top managers. In equilibrium, that means that they should be replaced by those with a lower bid.
            </p>
            <p>
                But of course this never happens, the owner’s income is derived from capital infusion and the structure of ownership, from sitting on top of a gigantic power structure created by capital ownership, and there is no
                competition for top wages. This power structure is derived from the infusion of capital which creates the industry or resource in the first place, it goes to the few who have the potential for a monopoly, and the regulation
                of public corporations is not sufficiently strong to induce competition of wages at all levels.
            </p>
            <p>
                The capital exchange markets do not produce equilibrium structures of power, they produce oligarchical structures. This trading process can only be kept safe from competition by producing enormous firms which are immune to
                competition, because they either undercut it in price to drive it out of business, or else acquire it. Without this you get bodegas, or small industries, which are completely competitive, and where ownership only produces a
                modest rise in income. The essential competitive fairness of cottage industry was noted by Marx, who contrasted it with industrial production.
            </p>
            <p>
                The nature of competitive equilbrium is not determined by me idealistically from prior principles. I didn’t have any prior principles. It is determined by asking what the actual predictions are for wages and prices in a true
                free market equilibrium would be. You could write a computer program to determine this, it’s something that is not adjustible except by fanciful thinking and distortion. That’s unfortunately what bourgeoise economics does,
                because it is largely a product of the elite class.
            </p>
            <p>
                The structure of the ownership in equilibrium is also more or less determined from the model, because in equilibrium, no one individual can make more than another, except to the extent that they invest more hours, or acquire
                a special skill. I didn’t make that up, that’s a famous failed prediction from economics textbooks, except in the textbooks, they ignore the fact that it fails.
            </p>
            <p>
                The structure of the society that you want to attain is found by taking the mathematical model seriously. When that model conflicted with my own preferences, I changed my preferences, and I will continue to change my
                preferences to match the real predictions of equilibrium, and advocate changing policy until the economy looks like an equilibrium, and not like a Marxian catastrophe.
            </p>
            <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; That’s … a problem (meaning ignoring Marxists)</p>
            <p>
                No! The exact opposite. Not doing this is the problem. Groups of people are not able to formulate new ideas, they are simply doing propaganda to promote old ideas already formulated by some individual a long time ago.
                Political organizations are lousy at understanding ideas or fairly promoting them, and the reason is the “philosophical parts of Marx”, the parts you claim I don’t understand.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ideas people promote come from their economic class, and their class-interest gets in the way of dispassionate evaluation. That’s true of members of powerless classes also, it is just less true, because the philosophy of
                the powerless doesn’t give them power. But certain parts of Marxist philosophy can potentially give you power, the Marxist-Leninist philosophy of a vanguard. Because the revolution transfers power to the vanguard, so being
                part of the vanguard is a decision with a power-interest component.
            </p>
            <p>To evaluate things which have objective answers requires a period of isolated study, and ignoring the teams. I don’t have any team on my side, and even if such a team emerges, I would still be powerless.</p>
            <p>
                I understand the philosophical parts of Marx, that was what kept me sane all my college years. I could sit and repeat “these people are thinking and acting this way because of the power structure”, so that I could continue
                to function in a bourgeoise environment, shifting more and more to the right after the failure of the USSR. I rejected traditional Marxist philosophy mostly I guess in response to the internet, which showed that it is
                possible to organize systems organically and efficiently in a decentralized manner, that’s the example of the design of the Linux kernel. Marxist ideology has reached the limit of its usefulness for prescriptive change,
                because it demands “all power to the Soviets”, which doesn’t help anyone at all, except those on top of the Soviets.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mathematical side of Marx, however, the consolidation of capital in a few hands, remains true, and can’t ever become obsolete. Part of this theory is subsumed into Keynesianism, except Keynes couldn’t touch the ownership
                structure. I am trying to fix this oversight. The point of Keynes is to only regulate the wages and monetary policy to work around the ownership structure, not to fundamentally decentralize the ownership. In my opinion, it
                is important to advocate for decentralized ownership right now.

            <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; … secular trends which prevent the system from returning to equilibrium…</p>
            <p>
                Those secular trends require political power, which is derived from economic centralization and the emergence of separate classes. The mechanisms I gave for splitting up capital are financial incentives, and they should work
                on any profit-making entity to split up power among several entities, which are never so large as to influence such trends individually.
            </p>

                There is no substitute for the mathematical theory of capitalist equilibrium, which right now is only being used and misused by capitalists who have no idea what kind of equilibrium it actually predicts. Marx was using it to
                form his critique, but he detested the language because it was used to justify atrocities, like the 80 hour workweek and subsistence wages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any attempt to approach an economic equilibrium is difficult, but there is a mathematical theory to guide you, so you always know where the problem is, and when your policy is fixing it or making it worse. That’s what gives
                it so much weight, and you cannot surrender this tool to the right. But when you are on the left, it is rare that you see someone take the time to study the mathematical ideas, because these mathematical ideas are learned by
                elites, and the elites are structurally biased to always advocate for their own privilege. Marx took the time to learn the mathematical theory, and this is what made him so powerful as a commentator.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is very simple to judge when someone is overpaid from equilibrium considerations— would someone else who is equally competent be willing to submit a bid to work the same position at 30% less salary? If the answer is yes,
                the only way that person maintains the high pay is because there must be political class barriers or barriers of monopoly set up around the position. This is true not only of business owners, it is true of media stars, of
                high-level managers at publicly traded corporations, and of some government contractors and appointees. It is not true of most small business owners, as they labor under competition. This demarcation is for me the line
                between the “bourgeoisie” and the “proletariat”, and unlike in Marx’s time, there are many small owners who do not go past the threshold, who are your natural allies.
            </p>
            <p>
                This principle, competitive vs. monopolist wage, to my mind subsumes and replaces the Marxist social class division. The predictions for what to do about it are substantially the same in any formulation, but when you are
                guided by economic equilibrium, people who are on the right listen very attentively, and you don’t get suckered by policies that give power to a separate bureaucratic elite, as the Soviets did.
            </p>
            <p>
                I read your links. They’re long. Ok, the first one is about epistemology, and I don’t see the point, sorry. Quantitative predictions about prices, wages, and production are the fundamental epistemology for economic systems,
                and the ontology you have is only interesting to the extent that it predicts economic numbers, and their change in response to policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The theory of economic equilibrium just tells you what everything should be priced (supply/demand at equilibrium), what everyone should be paid (the wage of the next competent bidder in line at zero unemployment). How
                ownership should be distributed (eventually to the workers), how business should be structured (in as small units as possible), and how decisions should be made (by democratic consensus of those that they affect). The reason
                is that when any of these conditions are broken, there are disgruntled employees, and new people will enter or leave, at equilibrium, until these conditions are met. When these conditions are violated systemically, as in the
                current centralized ownership structure in existing capitalism, you get furious oppressed majorities. The only way to violate these conditions is to have a punitive system in place of unemployment and homelessness, which
                allows you to force people to work for a heirarchy in workplaces which are unresponsive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding the second link, I don’t accept “60 year cycles”, as there isn’t enough economic data to find any of these. I don’t accept cycle theory at all, because economic ups and downs don’t go according to cycles. They go
                like a random walk, with some growth and periodic crashes. Any cycle theory requires inertia, which isn’t there in any obvious sense.

                Chicago school economics is an academic fraud. It is based on a concept of equilibrium which is fundamentally not there is markets as a whole. The concept of “voluntary” and “involuntary” only work in economic equilibrium.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a state or municipality raises minimum wage, there is a possibility for producers to flee to another state, or out of the municipality. This is much more difficult when the raise is nationwide. This is why to test the
                microeconomic predictions, you need to look at national raises of the Federal minimum wage. The rising Federal wage decreases unemployment, and that is a sign that the unemployment was NOT voluntary, it was simply a function
                of lack of equilibrium.
            </p>
            <p>
                The issue today is that there is no such thing as an international minimum wage, and trade policies lead to similar effects between nations, exploiting the lack of equilibrium internationally, which is much worse that the
                lack of equilibrium within each nation. There is no solution to this except fair-trade negotiations, which tie imports to higher wages overseas, and better working conditions. Without this, you reproduce the macroeconomic
                problems of a single nation worldwide, where there is no government that can ever save you.

                girlfriend. It’s not illegal to do, she won’t be prosecuted. It was just unethical, and completely unacceptable. In the 90s, she decided to press bogus charges against the White House travel staff. These charges led to a

                Yes, this is partly true. But there was a third reason for the adoption of abstract art by the CIA and bourgoisie. The third reason is that the USSR put in all the initial revolutionary time and effort to develop this art,
                and then stupidly suppressed it by government bureaucracy. Like all other socialist innovations, like space and modern physics, the bourgeoisie saw that it was the best thing evar and decided to steal it, and the groupthink
                of the Stalin led party let them do it. The only really significant thing the USSR did in art after that was Tarkovsky.

            <p>First, I made a mistake, due to having forgotten what “use value” meant in Marxist economic. It’s not equal to “exchange value”, it’s something else. In bourgeoise economics, it’s called the “monopolist’s price”.</p>
            <p>
                The identity of the labor and nonlabor theory of value is just philosophy. In what bourgeoise economists call “economic equilibrium”, the two are the same. It’s just that bourgeoise economists are under the conceit that
                economic equilibrium somehow resembles real existing capitalism, rather than an idealized anarchic socialism. They are wrong about this, and the model itself tells you.

                I’m not young anymore, I’m 42, and I came up with most of this stuff after a long solitary struggle with Marxism and Capitalism about 10 years ago, talking to exactly zero people, and reading only Marx (the bourgeoise side
                is just mathematics, and I could figure it out without reading anyone). I only come at if from Marx, but I use the language of bourgeoise economics, because the ideas are invariant to language, and it helps to translate Marx
                to bourgeoise language, because then you find that you are approximately a “post-Keynesian”.

                It’s not their fault, they were working before an internet, and they needed propaganda structures to spread their ideas, so the ideas needed to be standardized. With an internet and a few hours, I can explain the whole
                thing, and then just wait for you to catch up. The same is true of capitalists, by the way, who have no idea that economic equilibrium looks just like socialism until you tell them. They are also stupid.

                I do not claim to be well read. I worked this stuff out myself. When I said “the stage of monopolized production is nearly equally bad to the stage of state control under communist party rule”, I mean “bad” as in
                “inefficient” and “non-innovative”.
            </p>
            <p>
                My ideas live or die on their merits. They certainly don’t have any pedigree, like Marx’s or anyone else’s. All they are doing is translating Marx’s obervations to the mathematical language of modern economics, and noting
                that they are all amounting to “we are not in capitalist equilibrium”. Therefore, a transition to capitalist equilibrium is tantamount to a transition to socialism.

                This was appreciated to a certain extent by some Keynesians, but I don’t read anything, so I don’t know who said it first. I know the policy proposals I gave are 100% original, so it’s best if you respond to them without
                prejudice, because some of them really are new, in particular the graduated corporate tax, which unlike a tax on individuals encourages splits naturally, without oversight.

                The only two serious economic works I read cover to cover are “The Communist Manifesto” (when I was 15) and “Capital I” (when I was 30). I understood what they were saying. I also read some Soviet planning documents when it
                was current, and a bunch of Maxist essays, some Chomsky, a little bit of this and that.

                I worked out standard bourgeoise economics for myself, although it is clear Marx understood it. The points I am making are not incompatible with Marx’s mechanisms, but they are not travelling along the path of development of
                Marxist philosophy, because I consider philosophy a total waste of time. In this, I don’t think I am out of the mainstream for people living in real existing Marxist Leninist societies.

                Of course his racist statements are completely unacceptable. But what else is there to do? One has to make a decision regarding this sort of thing, it can’t come without consequence. Bernie can’t run for president as
                independent, that guarantees a loss both for him and the Democrat, and it guarantees he also loses his Senate seat. It’s not easy to determine the lesser evil from public statements, unfortunately, no matter how clear it
                seems to you in Europe. Trump is not Le Pen, he isn’t articulating a consistent racist position for years, he is simply saying whatever he wants that he thinks will get people to vote for him.

                It’s not speculation. Unregistered caucusgoers is the surest sign of fraud there is, it’s pretty much the only way to make fraud in a caucus, where the caucusgoers can audit the process in real time. A union can get a lot of
                unregisted people to bias the delegate count by several percentage points in each district. I really don’t know who had more support, given the statewide irregularities. In Iowa, the irregularities were localized, and the
                final count is certainly correct to within .01%, so the results are clearly accurate.

                Regarding “Hillary was behind it herself”, that’s a nonsense question. Was Bush behind the vote-fraud in Florida? Of course not. But Kathleen Harris got a congressional seat for a term for organizing some of it. Fraud
                happens when a political organization tolerates or rewards it, and unlike the Clinton campaign, the Sanders organization has been very strict in controlling any suspicious behavior from supporters once it is brought up.

                Oh, I see. I don’t have figures for what full employment looks like in terms of the real potential labor pool, but of course you’re correct. Come to think of it, this is I suppose the point of Sanders talking about real
                unemployment in the US, as opposed to official unemployment, that’s a main concern in his stump speech.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sanders is also progressive on trade, and I believe he is willing to let the dollar weaken somewhat, and negotiate from strength about trade issues, help local small or medium sized business that is export ready, and in
                general do anything possible to help.

                It should be possible to make international trade a lot more “adiabatic”, as moving products between regions with different mean wage is analogous to moving heat between sources at different temperature, just touching the
                two together is not a good idea. When it is done by transnationals, they just pocket the difference in wage. It is best if you do trade with a heat pump, so that it is closer to equal in either location, in this way you
                still build up industry overseas, but you introduce as little inefficiency as possible in intermediate stages in the form of outrageous profits and depressed wages.

                You’re assuming a fantasy economy where everything is in equilibrium. In a real economy, the “median” is sort of meaningless, the median wage might equal productivity (to pick an extreme example) because the unemployment is
                49% and the median employed person happens to be employed at a wage equal to the GDP/population, which is really half the GDP per productive worker, because the actual population is double the working population. That
                situation is terrible, and in a closed economy, a stimulus could employ everybody. What you say would be right assuming a closed economy (no imports/exports), enough capacity to more than employ everybody, and all capital
                divorced completely from income. But that never happens in real life, it’s always complicated by extra stuff, so I think you just have to do it gradually, and look out for signs of inflation.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a real economy, it is a mistake to say you’re only at full capacity when unemployment is 0%, that’s the false prediction that right wing Keynsians made (they aren’t real Keynesians), and it is disproved by “stagflation”.
                You can have stimulus produce pure inflation at 8% unemployment or 10% unemployment if there aren’t enough industries to employ everyone. Then you need new investment, and this is not produced by increasing wages, but by
                increasing investment capital, like what Reagan did with the tax cuts to the wealthy. Unfortunately, this type of business growth is at the end of large business consolidating and getting larger, it’s not like the Clinton
                growth of small business forming ab-initio. So it’s not like the Reagan nonsense did anything except produce lots of “Woolworth”s and “KMart”s, and large chains. It wasn’t like real imaginative economic growth, like in the
                90s.
            </p>
            <p>
                There’s also the serious problem of international production, and lack of international monetary coordination. For another extreme example, suppose all your production of consumer goods is in China using cheap labor, and
                this production is totally maxed out due to demand from Europe or somewhere. Now suppose you make a stimulus that goes to workers in the US. Then any rise in US demand can only be met with a rise in price of the Chinese
                goods in dollars (by the fall of relative value of the dollar), because the Chinese factories are already making as much as they can. Eventually, the inflation weakened dollar, makes it more productive to have the business
                form in the US, but at that point, the wage of workers has declined to Chinese levels in terms of the weakened dollar. This is why international trade without international monetary policy or international wage policy is
                problematic for wealthy nations, and why you need fair trade agreements which raise wages overseas, and ensure that the capital gains of international trade is not being pocketed by wealthy individuals at the top of
                transnationals. But there are still lots of US industries, they’re just weak, not everything is produced overseas. There’s local energy now, and local food, and local manufacturing to a certain small extent, so I don’t worry
                about it.
            </p>

                The $25/hr is not mine, it was Sanders. It’s just taking the minimum wage at 1979, considering it’s relation to average productivity, and updating it for inflation and productivity rise in the US since 1979. The inflation
                producing minimum wage should not be less than this. There is a problem with international production and stimulus, as I said, so it is best to err on the safe side and that’s a $15/hr minimum wage. That’s the Australian
                minimum wage, and it can’t be that Australia is more protectionist.

                There is no purely money-based metric which you can use to predict “full capacity” ahead of time, because it’s not a monetary call— it’s a question of whether you can make more real actual stuff, or whether people are
                already producing as much as possible. The only pure-money based metric you can use is AFTER you pass a stimulus, and then you can ask “How much of the rise in wages was negated by extra inflation?” And if the answer is
                “nearly all of it”, then you’re at full capacity, and it’s pointless to stimulate more. That kind of inflation hasn’t happened in the US since the mid 1970s.
            </p>
            <p>
                But that money-metric doesn’t help you predict anything ahead of time. So you need to look at the actual production in detail. You need to survey companies, and look for potential backlogs in production, where companies are
                stressed to deliver goods and services. An example of the kind of thing you look at: are warehouses full or empty? Are service providers working full-time or part-time? Are factories working 24/7 and struggling to fill a
                backlog or working 10% of the time and laying people off? The US tries to gather these types of statistics. Right now, the justified consensus is that it is safe to say that stimulus won’t produce inflation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main problem with trying to make such predictions using existing factory stocks and so on, is that when unemployment is low, and labor becomes mobile with public health insurance, you have no idea what new businesses
                will form, how quickly they will form. Maybe they will form very fast, as there is a potential vast empty uncharted space still for internet business. If new businesses form quickly, then you can produce a lot of potential
                new services and products, and prevent inflation even when the old measures of capacity are closer to fully loaded. It’s too complicated to answer in any glib way, and the way I think about it is “when you see inflation,
                then complain”. It also depends on foreign demand, and all sorts of things you don’t control directly.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a strong political resistance to stimulus, because it increases workers’ negotiating power, and decreases the influence of old industry. In the late 90s, the main stimulus was the EITC expansion under Clinton, which
                was a stealth stimulus, in conjunction with the Clinton tax increase, which balanced the budget (it was supposed to pay for health care that never came). At the same time, internet private ISPs appeared, and workers had
                rising incomes for years, because unemployment was low.
            </p>
            <p>
                Internet business valuations eclipsed those of old established business, due to the projections of complete transition to online services. This was a product of a deliberate policy to expand small online business, and people
                call it now “the 90s tech bubble”, as if it were purely speculative rise in asset prices. It wasn’t speculative like that, it was pumping money to new internet ventures that tried hard to innovate with delivery of services.
                You can see it wasn’t a bubble, because the same types of businesses are being created today, ten times slower.
            </p>
            <p>
                The collapse of the internet economy in 2000, I believe, was largely a matter of politics. After Bush won the election, it was clear there would be no protection for the new industries from the old, and their entire
                valuation collapsed instantly in a gigantic crash. All the new companies were either out of business in the bust, or consolidated into large monopolies by the middle of the decade. At the same time, government expenditures
                were backing large military contractors and enormous businesses, and cable monopolized ISPs, while wireless remonopolized communications. It was just the 90s in reverse, deliberately, thanks to Bush.

                I don’t, no. I have never made an economic projection in my life. But I do know what happened to economies at low unemployment, and it’s all good stuff. It is next to impossible to project what kind of growth you will see
                with an unemployment of 3% or 2% or 1%,, since we haven’t been there since WWII. People have been scared of trying due to NAIRU and Philips curve voodoo. The experience of the 90s with the first tech boom showed that
                inflation is far away even at very low unemployment. Keynesian theory is moribund, and ignorant of its own foundations. I welcome any estimate that says “I don’t know for sure, but I know it’s a heck of a lot of growth”.
                because, given the knowledge we have, it’s a heck of a lot better prediction than “I don’t know, but it’s a heck of a lot of inflation”. The effect of stimulus is always one or the other, and given that most new jobs in the
                US pay $25000 a year, and all the productivity gain is going to empty capital return for the wealthy without real new investment, it’s more accurate to project growth in response to rising wages than inflation.

                They are not modelled on European countries— there is no real social welfare in Sanders plan. The Health-care is just shifting existing spending around and removing bureaucracy, the college program is removing students from
                the labor pool, and the infrastructure program is getting rid of unemployment, in the Eisenhower way.
            </p>
            <p>
                The projection is conservative. It’s not “nefarious forces” that prevent stimulus, it is the structural rejection of Keynesian economics of the past 40 years. The reason you can’t pass stimulus anymore is that Republicans
                rejected Keynesian measures due to the 1970s stagflation. They didn’t understand how inflation works, they followed some “Philips curve” mumbo-jumbo, and believed that stimulus always drives unemployment to zero, even
                without a jobs program, and without investment. The stagflation showed you needed new investment, a jobs program is a stopgap until that investment shows up.
            </p>
            <p>
                The programs need to get enacted, and the projections of growth in Friendman’s model are not surprising, considering the anemic rate of growth in the last decade and a half. Sanders’ policies are better than those in Europe,
                they are better than any Keynesian measures enacted since the 1950s, because they really target unemployment. There is no reason to lie about the growth potential of such measures.

                it were the same folks sending exploding cigars to Castro. The US has a large covert operations division which has it’s own money, is completely unaudited and untracked, and does whatever it wants. For example, Oliver North.
                Israel is a small country, and it would be insane to assassinate any American, the US is its biggest ally. Please try to be more rational, because we have real problems in the US that are not caused by any Jews.

                Free college is not that expensive compared to health care, it is about double the Pell program, and it is paid by a small tax on trading. That helps to remove microtrading, which is used to levy an effective rent on stock
                and commodity transaction by the brokerages which can put their servers a few microseconds closer to the stock exchange, and capture requests early, and pre-empt them. This is one of the worst forms of fraud, and it starts

                The likely RFK shooters were recently identified milling around the hotel in old footage of the incident. They have nothing to do with Israel, and a lot to do with CIA and MKULTRA. They are certainly not “zionists” as both

                Sanders doesn’t claim that all issues of inequality are economic. He believes that the economic issues are fundamentally the ones that are most important to fix, so they should be the top priority. Once you address the
                economic component, and produce access to capital for all groups in the US, it becomes so much easier to address the other components. In this view, he is following Martin Luther King Jr.

                When a group of people have equitable wealth and equitable power, the remaining racism against them becomes socially unsanctioned, and becomes viewed as an abberant mental disorder. There were Jewish quotas in the US 60
                years ago, and most powerful business leaders and top academics were causually anti-semitic. But when the wealthy folks had to deal with Jewish colleagues, that became difficult to continue.

                There’s nothing vague here. The purpose of Sanders’ plan is to remove unemployment. US capacity is not maximized right now, there is a significant amount of unemployment and underemployment, and wages are catastrophically
                depressed. The economy is restructuring around large firms that employ large numbers of people at minimum wage, as opposed to smaller businesses with fair wages. This only helps the individual large corporation’s bottom
                line, it reduces spending.
            </p>
            <p>If the platform is enacted, a conservative estimate is that the economy will be producing at the last peak level. There is nothing wacky about Friedman’s growth estimates, he is probably understating the growth.</p>

            <p>Friedman is CONSERVATIVELY assuming that a stimulus program will maximize production quickly. That’s standard economics for nearly 100 years. It is certainly true.</p>
            <p>
                The rate of growth he gets is high because the stimulus is large. It is probably an UNDERESTIMATE, as Sanders policies are targeted at unemployment, and produce as low an unemployment rate as the infrastructure funding and
                political will allows.
            </p>
            <p>
                At zero unemployment or close, wages rise. Right now, the American economy is lumbering along is a half-depressed state due to lack of purchasing power. The precise numbers are not predictable, but Friedman did as good a job
                as possible.

                He is not assuming real productivity growth will be stellar in the sense of producing new industries, he tells you that the 5-6% growth is mostly due to redistribution and better purchasing power, and maximizing existing
                capacity. This growth must necessarily peter out after a few years, when production is maximum and people are getting paid reasonably. His predictions are due to share of income going to the workers who spend the money, as
                opposed to the investors who drive down the wages.

            <p>
                At the end of the 90s, when unemployment dipped below 4%, wages begin going up steadily at that point for all workers, and entrepreneurship became more easy and common when workers were not concerned about employment. This
                growth in small decentralized business was reversed by conscious decision to invest in large defense industry after 9/11, by Bush and co, and this is the real tragedy of the 21st century economy. I don’t know the exact

                tarnished by association with terrible totalitarian regimes. The real socialists are George Orwell and Albert Einstein, not Lenin and Chavez. He is also a Liberty party candidate, and has strongly supported the independence

                That’s not how it works. The economy is complicated, and wages at the low end are depressed by unemployment. You need to have a strong minimum wage and a strong anti-unemployment policy to have an economy where workers can
                negotiate for better wages. Without this, there is no economy, it is permanent depression. This has been understood since the 1930s, but willfully denied by the anti-Keynesian party.

                designed to remove unemployment, help students in college, and get rid of health care worries for small businesses. These are pro-growth policies. He is surprisingly the most libertarian Democratic candidate, as he does not

                The point of fair trade is that it is conditional on working conditions improving in the other country. It’s not all that restrictive, and it is good both for foreign and domestic growth. It also slows the loss of industry.
            </p>
            <p>There are a bunch of factors, but there are general principles which you need to be aware of, and one of these is the relation of unemployment to wage growth.</p>
            <p>
                Bernie Sanders does not propose to cut military spending in such a way as to remove it’s stimulus effect, he proposes to redirect it toward more productive avenues. Away from nuclear weapons, for instance, and away from
                large weapons projects. There is a lot of discretion in military budgets, and the internet and LFTR were both designed on military money.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of Sanders is to produce low unemployment. There is no surprise that this induces the maximum possible growth, as fundamentally, unemployment and underemployment are the original source of economic underperformance.

                Except that the mechanism of “Verdoom’s law” is understood— the loss of purchasing power due to unemployment driving down wages is a mainstay of economics for nearly 100 year. The projection is overly conservative, when you
                drive down unemployment by offering jobs, there is a lot of pressure on wages in industries where you don’t do anything, simply because workers are more empowered to demand better wages.

                Increasing minimum wage DECREASES unemployment until the point where the minimum wage is so high (like $30/hr) that it starts to produce inflation instead. This only superficially looks like a paradox, it is a fundamental
                principle of macroeconomics. It is the “perihelion precession of Mercury” for depressed aggregate demand— a counterintuitive prediction that is uniformly correct that you simply can’t make with pre-1930 economics. Pre
                Keynesian economics predicts the opposite, and fails.
            </p>
            <p>The reason is that lowest wages are always not anything close to their equilibrium value, they are depressed by competition with the unemployed. This prediction is the clearest demonstration.</p>
            <p>The jobs program is the infrastructure program.</p>
            <p>
                Sanders doesn’t advocate eliminating free trade, rather he advocates fair-trade policies that raise wages in the other country. This creates a better competitive trading field, and creates consumers for American goods, which
                are produced by a more specialized workforce.

        <div>
            <p>
                The basic principle in projection of policy impact on growth is what the effect is on unemployment. Sanders’ policies have an impact on unemployment in three ways: there is a jobs program which directly reduces unemployment,
                there is a college program which indirectly reduces unemployment by increasing the number of students and qualified applicants, and there is a minimum wage increase which produces stimulus by incresing demand. Under these
                conditions, it is not difficult to forecast best-possible growth, these are the best-possible growth inducers, as they reduce unemployment by the most possible. You can’t know what the detailed numbers are going to be
                precisely, but Friedman’s analysis is conservative and CBO based, and is likely as close to accurate as you can get.
            </p>
            <p>
                The criticism of Friedman is based on the fact that there are right-wing economists who make up Keynsian multipliers for tax-cuts, which is crazy because money to wealthy people does not increase demand significantly, rather
                it can increase investment. That type of economic fraud is what gives multipliers a bad name. But with Sanders policies, the multipliers are both theoretically and empirically justified. You can’t let bad economists crowd
                out the good ones using politics. You need to look at quantitative data to decide which analysis is correct.

                That statement shows you don’t understand macroeconomics. It is possible for people to not find a job because there isn’t enough demand, not because they aren’t willing to work for any wage. Reducing minimum wage, or
                removing it, makes unemployment go UP not DOWN. This is essential to understand, because it is one of the simplest way to see that marginal equilibrium analysis is entirely bogus for the economy as a whole, and it is a
                prediction verified with decades of data. This has been understood for 80 years, and I don’t understand how you can continue to pretend microeconomic predictions for unemployment and minimum wage work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The number of places where the private sector is deficient is effectively as infinite as the number of possible private sector jobs. Anything where the benefit is public and cannot be recouped except with a tollbooth is a
                good target for infrastructure projects. The essential point is that once you absorb excess labor, workers can negotiate pay equal to productivity, and once this happens, macroeconomics doesn’t exist anymore, the labor
                market goes to equilibrium, and you can use marginal analysis. The existence of unemployment wrecks equilibrium by reducing wages and undercutting demand. This is the foundational observation of macroeconomics.

                I am not ‘looking inward’ or denying the distance between real existing capitalism and perfect competitive equilibrium. I am simply using competitive equilibrium as a normative ideal, as Marx implicitly did in crafting the
                policies in the “Manifesto”. The use of competitive equilibrium as normative is standard in economics, even in Marxist economics, and it was also implicitly used in the allocation programs internal to planned
                Marxist-Leninist economies. The most progressive planners, like Alexei Kosygin, advocated for the use of market equilibrium norms, as did other mathematically oriented planners.

                I do not use any “dialectic”, because I don’t think talking to other people is useful in coming up with ideas, especially not sterile Hegelian dialectic type discussion, which is just a mind-numbing intellectual onanism. I
                believe in engineering practical solutions to practical problems, not in discussions with a bunch of philosophers. That was also the consensus that emerged among the rank and file, non-ruling-party non-elite in the USSR
                since the 1930s. They didn’t bother with questions of dialectic, they bothered with “how can we make more steel”.

                Only! That’s Capital I. That’s the intractable problem. Marx tells you that it is impossible to address this problem. He knows how to address all the other problems. I am showing you that it is not impossible to address the
                central intractable problem too, it is just monumentally difficult. I am not dealing with the other problems because other people are thinking about them, and they can be solved within standard bourgeoise thinking.

            <p>
                Regarding the return of rentier behavior, there is no barrier to bourgeoise economists solving that problem, as they partially did in the past, because rentiers act against bourgeoise interest as well as everyone else’s
                interest. That they haven’t done so yet, allowing rentiers to dominate, is due to the economic quacks who seek to protect capitalist profits, which are secretly rentier profits, where the rents are extracted from capital
                stock. There was a time not so long ago when any American could go to college and own a house, so this problem is not unsolvable for standard thinking. There was never a time where worker owned business became normative in
                the US, and the few Union owned companies like United Airlines never became the majority. United Airlines was one of the targets of the 9/11 attack, it was bankrupted by the attack, and the employee ownership was destroyed.
                American Airlines likewise stopped worker profit-sharing, from 2002 until 2014, when it was partially restored.

                Nobody will give them a loan, as it is not clear they will be able to pay back the principal, let alone the interest. Negative income tax creates a dependent underclass, it wastes people’s potential labor, and keep people
                depressed and on drugs. When someone’s labor is not used by anyone at present, you need to find a way to use it, or else you are wasting the most important resource— a human being. There’s no argument that this is good for
                growth, no matter how marginally useful the product of the labor, because the person would have been doing NOTHING otherwise.

                Infrastructure jobs absorb unemployment for useful labor, the government jobs can be construction, software, laying down high-speed lines, fundamental research, highways, windmills and solar power, nuclear plants, anything
                at all which requires labor that is unused. Absorbing all excess unused labor pushes you to a free frictionless labor market immediately among those not employed at a state job.

                The reason I don’t is because use value is equal to exchange value in economic equilibrium, as is the “labor value price” and the “exchange value price”. Any discussion of the difference can be subsumed into the more general
                question “What does equilibrium look like, and how do we get to it?”

            <p>
                I’m not a Keynesian or a post-Keynesian. I read MARX, not Keynes, and I reproduced Keynes from Marx for myself, because it is trivial to do, and for sure this is how Keynes originally did it. Except of course, I didn’t come
                up with the “sticky prices” nonsense Keynes made up, or anything like that. I just used class segregation and capital aggregation, like Marx explained, as post-Keynesians sometimes do.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Keynesians are not socialists, and their reforms do not aim to produce a socialist society, with equalized roughly uniform ownership of capital, up to a factor of 10 or so related to personal productivity, and workplaces
                owned by employees devoid of alienated labor. They are ok with a small class of people owning all the capital and directing workplaces from above, as they must be to be hired as bourgeoise economists in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not ok with that, because it for sure is not so in perfectly competitive economic equilibrium, it just is true in the real world. Economic equilbrium is something that is not hard to reproduce, with appropriate
                policies, because it is the outcome of competition without concentrations of power.

            <p>
                Much as housing reform led many Americans to land and home ownership, and to a large extent eliminated rentier behavior, workplace reforms can lead to workplace ownership and eliminate capitalist behavior. The latter is much
                harder, because it really does dismantle the source of power of the bourgeoisie, and eliminates them entirely as a class.

                No bourgeoise economist would ever propose such a thing, but no revolutionary Marxist can propose it either, because it maintains the legal structure of capitalism. This is why I feel I have to do it, because there are
                political barriers to this position from either side.

                I didn’t know who Hudson was until you asked, but now that I googled him, I guess the reforms Hudson advocates put a mild tax on rent seeking, and does not aim to radically alter capitalism’s structure. The things I am
                suggesting I believe really can radically alter capitalism’s structure, in that it will reproduce the undisputed success of real existing Marxist-Leninist economies— zero unemployment and fair wages for everyone, along with
                the undisputed success of the anarcho-syndicalist societies: non-alienated labor and self-management.

                Sanders turned Paul’s proposal from a recurring audit that would never pass into a one-time audit that passed, and made a permanent audit of the Fed a major plank of his platform.

                Come on, you are talking about a tax scheme for 2017 and worrying about future reductions of income inequality that will take at least a decade. Incomes don’t just go down just like that, it’s not confiscation or a salary
                cap. You just have CEOs and top managers paying more taxes.
            </p>
            <p>
                If Sanders’ policies do lead incomes do become roughly equalized, that means the US had the most terrific growth you could ever imagine, because that’s the only way income equality ever happens under these sorts of reforms,
                it’s roughly what happened in the 40s, 50s, and 60s.

                In this case, there is experience with single payer in every other country on Earth, and it is certain that it does work out like that. The taxes Sanders is proposing are actually more progressive than the health taxes in
                other countries, which are often a regressive VAT. So workers in Sanders’ plan pay genuinely less, the payroll and income tax for them amounts to far less than even the reduced cost of single payer, let alone the higher
                costs of current private insurance, because a significant fraction is born by general income taxes on the wealthier folks. This is the best designed single-payer system I could have hoped for from a candidate.

                your taxes. That’s the only real tax increase in the platform.

                Sanders is not just a progressive, he is also a strong liberty candidate. This is why he is so strong in the general election, many libertarians also find a lot to support in his platform, and they know where he stands even
                on the parts they disagree with, because he is straightforwardly honest about it. That is what every politician should be like, but unfortunately, today, it’s just him.

                Friedman’s analysis is too conservative. He is using CBO numbers and conservative multipliers. The effect on unemployment alone should increase wages by a ton, not just through spending, but through actual competitive wage

                He doesn’t like using multipliers for economic predictions because Republicans misuse them for false predictions of economic growth from tax cuts for the wealthy. But the fact that quack economists misuse a tool doesn’t mean
                that you need to discount a person who is using the tool properly.

            <p>
                Keynesian stimulus doesn’t give a multiplier when the money goes to the wealthy. Everyone knows that already, and there’s no reason to continue along with an academic fraud just because some prominent quack economists are

                states like Dilas or Dubcek. It’s alternative ideas for discussion that I think achieve what I consider superior outcomes within a legal framework which is not fundamentally radically changed from the one that we find around

                Marx invented macroeconomics, and in doing so created the theoretical foundation for Keynesian economic theory, and he never gets academic credit for it. That doesn’t mean he was a Keynesian, he wasn’t. He was a
                revolutionary. It just means he understood the theory behind Keynesian economics, because he was responsible for nearly all of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way to transition from Marxism to Keynesianism is simply to say “Ok, Marx is right. There is a problem in capitalism due to unemployment driving down labor wages. What is the minimum policy you can adjust to fix this
                problem and fix nothing else?” If you ask this question, you are immediately led to minimum wage reform, maximum working hours, and stimulus spending to reduce unemployment including unemployment insurance. That’s it. That’s
                how Keynesianism was really born.
            </p>
            <p>
                Marx was much more far reaching in his vision of what to do, but the Keynesians were reacting to the realities of both the great depression and the USSR. By the 1930s, the depression made it clear that Marx’s analysis was
                spot on. It was possible to have overproduction and a general glut. It was possible for unemployment to go sky high while capacity was underused, it was possible for wages to drop to subsistence even when productivity
                intrinsically stayed the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                But it was also clear that a Marxist revolution along the lines of the USSR leads to political difficulty in allocating resources and power internally. In 1932, the USSR had a collectivization famine. The first five year
                plan worked, but it was entirely managed by bureaus, and there was terrible repression, show trials, and complete loss of civil liberties under Stalin.
            </p>
            <p>
                So Keynes ripped of Marx’s analysis, did not give him credit, hired Marxist associates to advise him, and put out policy prescriptions which essentially borrowed all the economic points Marx made, with nonsense
                justifications from Capitalist marginal analysis, justifications which were not coherent, because they ignored the class segregation and capital aggregation which are central to Marxist theory. But the prescriptions work
                anyway, more or less, despite Keynes justifications being full of holes, because Marx had the analysis right.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every serious Keynesian knows this, by the way, they are just not allowed to say it, because Marx is taboo in mainstream economics to this day. This despite the fact that all modern mainstream economics (at least in the
                dominant Keynesian tradition) is built on Marx’s analysis, in obfuscated form, with a lot of nonsense added too.
            </p>
            <p>
                I refuse to go along with this academic charade. Whatever Marx would have thought of Keynesian policies, he is the intellectual father of macroeconomics, and not Keynes, and he deserves the academic credit. As far as I know,
                I am the only one saying this. Politically, Marx followers don’t want credit for Keynes stuff, and Keynes followers don’t want to be associated with Marx.

                This is not utopian socialism! It is a legal framework for transition to worker owned industry which is PRACTICAL and LEGALLY ACHIEVABLE in every modern industrial economy, with the existing legal system. Each measure can be
                supported and passed by a legislative body individually, and collectively it produces no more barriers than the New Deal measures, or Medicare.
            </p>
            <p>
                The issue of discrimination between “utopian” and “scientific” socialism was of whether there was an economic analysis of the mechanism of consolidation of capital, and of the production of class structure, and the influence
                of the class structure on politics. The only “scientific” contribution of Marx was in the analysis of consolidation of capital, and in this respect, he created Keynesian economic theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                The remainder of Marxist theory is an extrapolation of future development to a state where all production is monopolized, and the empoverished workers overthrow the owners, and control the monopolized industry using
                revolutionary committees. Both the monopolized state of production AND the revolutionary state of communist party ownership of the monopolized production are NEARLY EQUALLY TERRIBLE, and must be avoided at all cost.<br />
                The only solution is to avoid the monopolization and concentration of capital in the first place. The same scientific principles that Marx identified that show you how it happens can also be used to engineer a system where
                it doesn’t happen, and where it happens in reverse, distributing capital more broadly rather than more narrowly.

                Jobs programs are expensive, but not that expensive, because they ultimately are stimulus programs— they are only required when the economy is depressed, and the number of workers looking for state jobs is relatively small
                when private business is hiring. They can be paid for by existing taxes or even by bank taxes (printing money), and if there is inflation, by shifting to corporate taxes or income taxes. Inflation is controllable today. Jobs
                programs have been done before, the US does it with it’s highway and military budget continuously since the 1950s, just never before with an explicit goal of zero unemployment. Zero unemployment gives a ton of negotiating
                power to employees, this is the key.

                The taxes to pay for health care are income and payroll in Sanders plan, and they are a little easier than in Europe, because the US is net wealthier. The tuition free universities is paid for by a transaction tax on trades,
                which makes sense because of microtrading and speculative trading. A little bit of friction is ok with many conservative economists. The net tax effect is easier, because there is no welfare component to the plan.

                “return on investment” is predicated on growth potential, not just on stealing from the workers. If the capital return is in a worker-owned business, it isn’t stealing from anyone, it is equitably shared, and the workers
                either reinvest it themselves, or hire someone to do so at a fair professional salary, and that person is not exploited either, nor do they make an obscene return by siphoning capital into their pockets.

                I am not advocating for the preservation of capitalism. If you read my edited comment (I edited while you were responding), I am trying to build the socialism through worker ownership within the legal structure of
                capitalism, and without a revolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is important to do, because it is possible. It is also difficult to do, because of resistance from the owners, and also because of resistance from leftists. But it is essential to advocate because of this, and this is
                why I do it.

                The idea that you will reclaim the stolen wealth by revolution is problematic, because the revolution simply confiscates the wealth, and then has the problem of distribution and future production, which reintroduces the
                problem of division of power, except now with only revolutionary political mechanisms for distributing power. The mechanisms for distributing power in govenrnment or revolutionary bodies do not exist, and if they did, they
                would amount to worker owned cooperatives distributing capital to themselves, and for expansion.

                This is not sellout stuff I am talking about, it is real Marxist thinking, except working within the legal framework of division of power by division of capital. The place it differs from Marx is in the degree to which
                centralization is desirable in intermediate stages. The correct answer is “none at all”.

                Raw materials are not that hard to find, it’s just an issue of relative cost. The quest for cheap labor hurts the developed economies and to a certain extent helps the targets of imperialism, as they acquire manufacturing
                expertise, which can be used to spin off local firms. It only helps individual firms outsourcing, not the West’s overall economy. The quest for “additional markets” is silly, that’s just people buying stuff, it’s no longer
                the mercantile era where the manufacturing is all done in Britain. The whole trade system is a mixed bag. The real problem is the concentrations of power in multinational firms. With a decentralized approach, globalization
                can just mean local development with independent local firms, and “raw materials” can just mean selling Lithium on an open market, without multinationals or governments going to war over it.

                If you actually read Marx, you see he had a very nuanced view of the role of Capitalism. For Marx, the role of Capitalism was to end at centralization, and then the role of socialists was to seize the centralized production
                and redirect it to the common good. It’s all very easy, because consolidation and centralization of power is the inevitable outcome of the mechanisms, and then seizing centralized things is just a matter of a large number of
                people replacing a small number of owners.
            </p>
            <p>
                The central problem that Marx identifies is the mechanism of consolidation. The cycle of capitalist production produces large amounts of capital in the hands of a few, and loss of capital for the many. This leads to
                centralization of capital in a few hands, and the oppression of many by the few. His fix is to seize the concentrated capital.
            </p>
            <p>
                This fix doesn’t work, because the concentration of power is already bad for production long before it is seized. Marx simply assumed it would be more efficient to have these enormous companies, but it just isn’t. These
                concentrations of power are themselves destructive to economies, with or without a revolution putting them in the hands of a communist party. The political structure doesn’t matter all that much. You need to break the power
                structure up, to have decentralized production, whatever the structure of the government.
            </p>
            <p>
                To reverse the consolidation in capitalism, you need explicit policy that makes incentives for capital to be distributed broadly, and policy to prevent it concentrating unduly. This means capital must be managed
                professionally, not by wealthy individuals owning it, and its profits widely distributed, by public stock or collective ownership, where appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no law of capitalism that says that this is impossible, it’s just never been done successfully, although some parts are attempted now and again. I am trying to explain how to do it more fully. It requires conscious
                effort toward the goal, and rejection of revolution in favor of the much harder problem of designing uniform fair policy which pushes in this direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                An apropos physics analogy is a phase transition. The laws of water molecules aren’t all that different at 0 degrees C as at 1 degree C, but the behavior of the water is different. Marx noticed that capitalism is at 0
                degrees, it is unstable to freezing, so you get blocks of ice, the large firms, inside the water of normal people with normal amounts of money doing free trade. The Marxist-Leninist method freezes the whole economy, and puts
                a small number of water molecules at the top to move the gigantic ice cube this way or that. It’s worse than the disease. The solution I am proposing is to increase the temperature, so that the ice never forms in the first
                place. This is more difficult, but it is the only permanent solution.
            </p>
            <p>It requires very little government force, because everyone wants the ownership of capital to be more equitably distributed, including a majority of capitalists.</p>

                The government is not a weaker power, it can tax and therefore it can destroy. I don’t support the idea of an extra-governmental vanguard agency, like the communist party, being given revolutionary power through Soviets to
                influence and direct the activities of government, because the vanguard and its Soviets are a greater concentration of power than the businesses it is regulating.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reversing the problems Marx identified is a matter of sensibly designing new conditions where the laws of consolidation and accumulation work in reverse, toward greater distributed ownership, and decentralized business. This
                is not impossible, it’s just much much harder than staging a revolution. The revolution can’t produce this effect, because a decentralizing policy reduces the power of the revolutionary vanguard as well, and is opposed by
                the vanguard.
            </p>
            <p>
                To see this, consider the extreme difficulty of passing even moderate decentralization measures that Tito and Kardelj faced, or Dubcek, or Gorbachev. Only Tito had moderate success, and only Tito had a relatively productive
                economy. But Tito also suppressed more radical voices for decentralization, like Dilas. Once you produce a revolutionary vanguard, the vanguard sits there opposing decentralization worse than the capitalists do.

                The top graduated tax rate can be lower than that in other countries, the “graduated” part is the important part, the fact that the top rate is growing as the number of non-owning emloyees grows, not the value of the top
                rate. Whatever the top rate is, it just needs to give the companies sufficient financial incentive to split, in whatever way that split makes sense economically.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also make the lowest rate negative, so that it becomes a uniform subsidy for small companies. The goal is to give companies financial incentive to either decentralize or maximize employee ownership, or both, it’s
                goal is not to raise revenue. The tax, if there is a negative component at smaller business side, might end up costing money in the end. I imagine it as revenue neutral.

                I also agree with Sanders that trade deals need to be negotiated with the view of raising employee wages in the trading partner to be comparable to those in the wealthier countries. This is something that requires a whole

                I believe that you can get political consensus for these measures both from Marxists and from Libertarians, as they are minimal fixes to the central problems Marx identifies. That means election after election, where you try
                to get each plank enacted, step by step. Obama’s election for me was halting the implementation of the opposite platform, the Koch bros. John Birch platform. Sanders will work to get point 1, reduced unemployment, with
                target zero unemployment. Perhaps he or his successor will work for point 2, graduated corporate income tax. Contract reform might have to be state by state, but if there is consensus among lawyers, it might happen. Contract
                law is very technocratic, and usually supervised by lawyers, not the public. The previous reform was the “Uniform Commercial Code” of the 1950s, which gave guidelines to states for contract law, and these guidelines are
                updated technocratically, and states usually pass them by rubber stamp, because nobody pays any attention to this. No insider equity is something I saw mainstream people advocating, as the failure of the equity incentives
                for managers have become obvious.
            </p>
            <p>
                The transition to worker ownership I see as happening company by company, through unionization drives where appropriate (importantly, unionization not with the goal of joining a national union, but with the goal of eventual
                acquisition of the place of work)— this is appropriate for bookstores, movie theaters, independent retail outlets. It is easier when there is a jobs program and effectively zero unemployment, because the threat of getting
                fired carries less of a bite. For larger organizations, you might need to use threats of consumer boycott where appropriate, local zoning decisions to prevent new stores until the management of old stores is independent, and
                so on. For enormous state level enterprises, some will have to be broken up, many will break up just for tax purposes with a graduated tax, and others will have to be converted to more reasonable managment by worker action.
                It is much easier to ask for more power when you can find a job somewhere else. Workers are very powerful at zero unemployment, this is why full employment policies are always resisted, even though everyone knows they are
                good for growth.

                Re “splitting the vote to get Sanders elected”, it’s not real. They won’t actually split the vote, they just say so for political advantage right now. If Sanders doesn’t get the nomination, I will vote for Clinton (and take

                I think you are too pessimistic. You can probably get instant runoff in Vermont right now. You can possibly make a deal with Democrats to introduce instant runoff in districts where the vote is sometimes close, and where
                they will benefit from the runoff Green vote, and you can also get instant runoff in places where Republicans believe they will benefit from the Libertarian vote runoff. There is an interest to the major parties in this too,
                as they believe they will still win with instant runoff, and won’t have to worry about vote-splits anymore. In the short term, they are right, in the long term, not. but politicians think short term.

                I already know all of that, with one exception regarding your statement about abstract art at the end. Their behavior is indeed that of “effective Marxists”, I just wanted to explain the actual thinking there (if you can
                call it thinking), to make sure it was clear.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is also really the behavior of “effective statist Marxists”, or “effective Marxist-Leninists”. It is not the thinking of “effective libertarian Marxists” or “effective anarchists”. Interestingly, this makes libertarian
                conservatives, in part, enemies of the bourgeoise elite, because their anti-elitist and anti-collectivist streak means that they oppose part of the bourgeoise structure, the social part which puts an enlightened minority in
                charge, while at the same time leaving alone the economic part which is in reality the fundamental reason this social structure is erected in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn’t know the irrationalist tendency was analyzed already, I just noticed it myself, I didn’t read enough Marxists (although it’s not so hard to reproduce Marxist thought if you know Marx). I agree it is obvious. I agree
                with everything you say about the bourgeoise mentality, but I disagree that it is hopeless to reach out to individuals. Conservative libertarians don’t usually believe in their own special magic, they already agree on the
                problem, at least in its social aspect. Once they see a practical economic solution that does not depend on statism or a vanguard, or tyranny of the vanguard, putting a new elitist class in charge of even more state power,
                they often switch and support the economic policies, at least in sufficient numbers to win elections.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is one exception to our agreement: abstract art. Abstract art is NOT “un-art” (at least if you are talking about Pollock and Schoenberg and not Rothko and Cage, although even Rothko and Cage have their merits as
                un-art), it is a Western co-option and extension of the socialist avante-garde which was begun in the USSR in the 1920s, with the explicit goal of producing something totally new, something you’ve never seen before. It
                succeeded in that. The earliest pieces in the MoMA are the Soviet “Suprematist” paintings, which introduced the modernist vocabulary and philosphy, and really form a radical revolutionary break with previous art.
            </p>
            <p>
                The USSR stupidly suppressed the avante-garde in the 1930s and 1940s by loss of funding, when the government made large bureaus to produce mass art, entertaining the public became the priority, and the decisions were made by
                non-artist party members, by the “artistic vanguard”, which was neither. It was a bunch of party hacks with a lot of political power and absolutely no taste. Then the “Socialist realism” took over, and it was largely awful.
                “Socialist realism” meant musicals, spectacles, realistic painting, and large productions. It destroyed the Soviet avante-garde. The German fascists had the same reaction to the new avante-guard, except they called it
                “Jewish-Negro art” (they meant “muggle art”), and were even worse in suppressing it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even the second-rate “Soviet realism” kitch and its descendants, the Soviet musicals of the 1940s and Soviet space operas of the 1950s and 1960s, were co-opted by Western commercial artists (like Norman Rockwell, who was the
                premier American Soviet Realist) and Hollywood (Star Wars should have been a Soviet production, nearly all of it was prefigured in Sputnik era space fiction. It was done instead by new little producers in California), while
                the Soviet avante-garde was co-opted by the bourgoise elite. This was done by purchasing the work of Western socialists reproducing and extending Soviet forms which were killed by the bumbling Soviet state, and kept alive by
                socialists outside the USSR. You don’t appreciate how terrible the USSR was for the socialist movement outside.
            </p>

                The class struggle is a struggle of classes, not of individuals. The individuals in the controlling class do not have to be conscious of their class role in the Marxist sense to do their work. In fact, it is very difficult
                for them to become Marxists and maintain their position. They are certainly NOT secret Marxists, they are something else, which is difficult to describe to a Marxist, because it is so childish and silly, you will laugh, you
                won’t believe me. I’ll call it “Harry Potter syndrome”.
            </p>
            <p>
                The basic idea of Harry Potter syndrome is that there are certain individuals, a small group, who are specially magically sensitive. They can predict political and social trends, they have fine-tuned special senses, and they
                can influence other people by simply the power of thought and wishful thinking. These special magic people are given this magical skill at birth, by random chance. It’s more or less genetic. They do not need to analyze to
                know, they just KNOW. This “power of intuition” is emphasized in Fascist and right-wing thought, in Nietsche, in Heidegger, and especially in Ayn Rand, where the magical power is attached to sexual power, and to domineering
                authority. This magic power is the fundamental conceit of the bourgeoisie.
            </p>
            <p>
                These people call themselves the “natural Aristocracy”, and many of them are born to a bunch of ordinary saps, who don’t have this magic power, who I will call “muggles” (in line with the Harry Potter theme— Harry Potter is
                actually a perfect introduction to the thinking of the Bourgoisie). The point of the American social structure is to let the magic minority rise to power by getting the government out of their way.
            </p>
            <p>
                The power structure filters out people who interpret class issues in this childish way, and places them in positions of power. The reason is that others simply don’t have the stomach to do the immoral things required to rise
                through the heirarchy, because they don’t have the delusion that they are special, and deserve to be on top. You need that delusion to step on 99 others to make it to the 1%.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not all of the people who believe they are magic succeed, of course, just a relative few. But ALL the people who rise are magical people, not muggles. They demonstrate this by various gestures and symbols of power, which are
                not particularly obvious, but you know what they are— it’s how you identify the bourgoise aspirant among the working class.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of these sell-outs do more than social gestures, they actually have various magic incantations and rituals, for instance, look at Oprah’s “The Secret”, the popularity of occult rituals (despite their ridiculous
                stupidity), and the prominent role of sex-magic gurus, like the Orgone fellow in the 1950s.
            </p>
            <p>The role of these incantations is to bring you the magic power, influencing wealth to come to you. Once you have wealth, success reinforces the belief.</p>

                Needless to say, the vast majority of people with this belief structure are never going to get any wealth, as magic doesn’t work. These people either come to believe they are “muggles”, their magic is defective, or else
                reject the belief entirely, and realize that there is no magic. The magic people are then by self-selection the majority among the bourgoisie, and in their mind, they are in the minority position of KNOWING that there
                actually IS magic, but having to hide it from the muggles, so the muggles won’t feel inadequate, pretending that people are equal in public, and they are only able to speak about this fundamental inequality of magic-people
                and muggles among each other.

                Of course, a Marxist is immune to any such superstition, and it is difficult to even explain that there are grown adults who think this way. Drugs like cocaine help in this delusion, also LSD, as they damage the analytical
                faculty at the same time as giving false insight and isolation. But the simplest way to acquire this philosophy is simply to be born wealthy, which gives you a sense of specialness and unique purpose.

                While I am not in a position of power, I was an academic scientist by training. So I went to a rather elite school, and I was surrounded by the elite bourgeoise . The mentality of elites regarding class is opposite to the
                Marxist view, where class is an emergent structure of the economic transactions, and has very little relation to the individual in question. For the elites, class is purely a product of individual magic power, and selects
                out the individuals with most magic to wealth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you understand this, the manfacturing of consent takes on a completely different tone. The need to manipulate the public is not a conspiracy to prevent them from revolt— nor is it even against the interests of the
                masses. It is noblesse oblige to keep the muggles from finding out about the magic world, and feeling bad about their own lack of magic. It also prevents Marxism, which is evil because it sets up barriers to power, which
                prevents the magic people from using their special magic to protect all the rest of the society.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is really how the bourgoisie thinks. They blame the collapse of the USSR on the lack of magic people in top positions, not on economic problems caused by centralization, or on extrenal factors. It’s just that the
                Marxists were foolish enough to think people are basically equal, and there isn’t a minority with special magic powers that can use their magic to help everyone else.
            </p>
            <p>
                It really helps to reread all the internal documents with this point of view if you are a Marxist, no matter how stupid it may seem to you, because it will reveal how non-evil people can do things like this without
                conspiracy. They just feel the need to both protect you, and help you, using their specialness. That’s how they think, get used to it. No amount of education can change it, it’s a self-reinforcing belief. The belief leads
                one to view the class structure as benevolent.

            <p>The early stage startup can do whatever it likes, distributed equity, whatever the employees agree on, it’s private. This stage is usually very equitable to all involved.</p>
            <p>
                Once a company has an IPO, once it is publically traded, it gets a huge infusion of capital, and the public interest needs protection. After IPO, equity packages don’t go to the employees, but to top executives, who are in a
                position of power now. These options package are simply used to transfer a small but significant fraction of corporate profits to the board of directors and top managers.
            </p>
            <p>
                This distortion doesn’t directly affect corporate profits all that much, but it produces an enormous pay gap between top managers and regular employees or midlevel managers, and is responsible for social inequality. It is
                not competitively earned income, and so it produces a race to the top which is not justified by a skill on a resume. This produces perverse incentives.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the board wants to pay itself, it can decide on a salary. The stock-option deals are both the main source of insider trading allegations, it is next to impossible to avoid insider trading when the top managers own stock
                and options, and it is also the main source of the pay imbalance. Salaries of top managers are usually not as exhorbitant as the options, which effectively steal from shareholders at amounts relatively too minute to complain
                about.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a full employment policy, and with salary payments, it is reasonable to imagine that the management of publically traded corporations becomes less political and more technocratic, as there is no longer the lavish pay
                and class separation that comes with the high position. It becomes a professional job like any other, perhaps a bit more demanding than most.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a technocratic management, the step to worker control is modest, because all the workers managers are more or less social equals, and there is no negative class mobility in moving to greater worker control. This is not
                imposed, I assume that workers will prefer to work under worker control, so you don’t need to mandate it, just create the conditions where it naturally emerges.

                (open published contracts, no special deals) 4. no insider equity (stock in public corporation can only be owned by non-employees) 5. transition to worker owned industry 6. deregulation of the worker owned industry.

                This is very different from traditional shifts to worker control, as it is entirely voluntary, and requires no revolutionary break at any point. It is compatible with the legal system of capitalism, although the intended
                endpoint is a sort of market socialism. The only mechanisms introduced to induce worker ownership are gentle pushes through the tax code.

                To have capitalism, the government enforce property rights through a system of contracts and deeds, and you trade the contracts and deeds to others for payments, with the goal of producing more value after the trade. The
                justification for free trade is efficiency and competition, which in theory produces a capitalist equilibrium where everyone’s needs are met, and people get compensated according to their productivity, more or less.
            </p>
            <p>
                When this trading produces monopolies and unemployment, you don’t get anywhere near the theoretical equilibrium, and the economy is depressed. The role of socialism, as far as I am concerned, is to produce uniform deed and
                contract policy which encourages decentralization. The process by which you do this, from my point of view, is by introducing a system of taxes which encourages decentralization, and only enforcing contracts which allow free
                fair competition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Marxists-Leninists believe that trade must be restricted altogether, or power allocated through government bureaus. Like nearly all socialists since 1956, I think this is a failure, as the concentrations of power in
                government are even worse than the concentrations of power in the most awful busineses.

                “There is no safe dose of radiation.” This is not at all clear. We are exposed to radiation all the time in nature, from bricks, cosmic rays, dust, coal, and so on. The model people used for radiation damage is the “Linear
                no-threshold model” (LNT), which is based on the observation that DNA damage is proportional to the number of ionizing particles travelling through your body (which is true), and that the response to DNA mutation is
                sometimes cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
                The projection in the model is that the cancer response is roughly linear in the damage. This is true for large-dose sporadic exposure, like an occasional burst of radon in mines, Hiroshima bomb, or big doses on lab animals,
                and there the LNT model works. For small chronic doses, comparable to natural radiation, the model is very controversial today, and seems to fail entirely.
            </p>
            <p>
                The (presumably) proper model is most probably the “hormetic model”, which says that radiation damage in doses less than or equal to natural radiation does not produce additional cancers, but paradoxically produces fewer
                cancers. The reason is not pretty, it’s because your body’s immune system just gets a little better at weeding out mutant cells, or mutant cells are urged to self-destruct. This radiation hormesis thing not completely clear
                scientifically, the data at low doses is not conclusive, and people are working on it now. The French model is the “threshold model”, which says that doses comparable to natural radiation are negligible for calculating
                cancer risk, and that’s probably a safe assumption. There are additional unknown effects of small doses of radiation, like RNA breaks in neurons, which are also inconclusive. But since a person living in a brick house or at
                high altitudes gets something like 3 times the radiation exposure that a person living in a wood house at sea level gets, I think you shouldn’t worry about small exposures at all.
            </p>
            <p>The effect of extremely low-dose radiation is very difficult to study, but I believe the emerging view that it is not at all harmful.</p>

                I don’t believe the new reactors are decades away. I think that you could roll out a generation of LFTRs in 5 years or less, with a fully funded research project. Technically, it is much simpler than existing designs. The
                point of LFTR is that it reuses the waste, it can be rolled out in conjunction with traditional plants, and the old plants can be phased out eventually. France has already transitioned to fully nuclear electricity, using the
                old designs.

                The sun is being used already. The Earth uses a non-negligible fraction of the photons that hit the Earth for plant bacteria and plankton growth. Conversion and storage are much more problematic, and nuclear is vastly
                cheaper and in LFTR, completely practically inexhaustible.

                What you are missing is that the critics are not willfully trying to protect their power (although this is what their actions amount to), they actually believe their own propaganda, and that propaganda is structurally
                dominant not because people are willfully ignoring the problem, it’s because they are sure that you don’t have a solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your experience regarding pushing change comes with pushing a flawed proposal. When you push a flawed proposal and meet resistance, it isn’t because the resistance is evil or irrational, it is because your proposal is
                incorrect. You have to fix the proposal first, and be sure that it works, before going around claiming that others are sabotaging it out of self-interest.

            <p>
                The amount of state power required is, I believe, a graduated corporate tax, a transparent competitive contract reform, guaranteed employment, and no-insider-equity. These, along with the existing systemic moderate
                inflation, inheritance taxes, and progressive personal taxes, remove the concentrations of wealth in individuals, and protect against capital accumulation in monopolistic business, by giving natural incentives to split.
            </p>
            <p>
                I cannot support any scheme for reversing private concentrations of power in capitalism which grants even more power to the ostensibly public entity doing the reversing. Then the solution is worse than the disease. This is
                the criticism of real existing Marxism that people give, the obnoxious superpowers of the public representatives, and it is a cogent criticism. If the concentration of power you introduce places a bureau in charge of all
                businesses, then I would rather have the businesses than the bureau.

                Capitalism, by the way, is only the second largest concentration of power in history. The biggest would have to be the Roman slaveholding aristocracy. That was transformed by persuasion, in that case, conversion to
                Christianity, and it took too long.

            <p>
                I know the flaws in real existing capitalism, I am engineering a solution. I believe the filters you find which prevent progressive change are not just due to intrinsic power structures and self-interest, although that is
                the obvious mechanism by which these filters always work. They are fundamentally due to current real lack of engineering solution to the problem of the design of a real, stable, actual socialism.
            </p>
            <p>
                The trends in capitalism are obvious. My claim is that they are structural, they are due to the “M-C-M'” cycle, as you and Marx put it, and the only sensible fix to this is to separate the C and M so that people who manage
                capital are making money, not making capital. This is systematically attempted in public corporations, in professional investment banking, and so on. It is difficult, because the structures are never very good, and a uniform
                legal system doesn’t stop concentrations of capital from forming anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am proposing to do it, and I believe you are dogmatic in your refusal to acknowledge that it can be done. Once you understand it theoretically, you can start doing politics to implement it step by step by usual means, and
                persuade critics that it actually does work.

                You don’t need to impose something by force that everyone already wants, you just need to gently nudge, and people can do the rest without top-down imposition. The less you impose from on-high, the more naturally the
                structure will emerge. You don’t want an official “worker coop bureau” in the government deciding what counts as a coop, because that will end with them certifying that WalMart is a worker coop because the workers can vote
                on the location of the water cooler, and all the “legal preference” will go to WalMart, and not to real coops. Look what happened with “organic” and “certified organic”.

                at the expense of plants. Wind is not perfect either, as it blights areas, and has environmental impact on birds. Nuclear is tiny, and as I explained, with good engineering, it is a complete solution.

                That depends crucially on the size of the company, and the voting structure of the board of directors. The goal is first to minimize the size of companies that don’t need to be big. There is no reason for retailers to be
                big, that’s just wasteful and pointless consolidation, and it can be reversed with high minimum wage, fair competition contract policy, Sherman act enforcement, and consumer boycotts. You can kill WalMart very quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The type of nonvoting profit-sharing stock is largely meaningless in terms of directing work at a day-to-day level, and I believe such stock and options on such stock must only be traded by the public, and NEVER be owned by
                employees, as it is a form of insider trading. The reason corporate compensation is so off the charts is that the board of directors is issuing stock options to itself to sponge off the corporate profits, at the expense of
                millions of independent stock holders. This is a form of fraud, and “no insider equity” is a simple way to prevent it.
            </p>
            <p>
                A company can still be worker managed even when all the profit-sharing stock is owned by others. The pressures for the workers to expand the business now comes from outside, as stock-owners agitate for best policies, but the
                employees can still manage day-to-day decisions.

                themselves or lying. I can’t design a better system, any more than I could write a new OS from scratch by myself.

                What I am telling you are a series of serious PRACTICAL steps which can produce a transition to socialism, without any sort of revolutionary transformation at any point. This smooth path of transition is required, because
                the division of power negotiations under revolutionary socialist planning reproduces precisely the struggles of contract law under capitalism, and from all revolutionary precedents, it produced an even more lopsided division
                of power, because there was no court system nominally independent of the communist party to decide the contractual obligations of parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is why capitalism, outside of fascist states, and as atrociously corporate and centralized as it is, ended up with a more decentralized business authority structure than Marxist Leninist regimes. This is why China spent
                the last 30 years writing and debating contract law. If you want to fix capitalism to turn it into socialism, look at contract law, and set taxes to encourage decentralization and small business.

                My claim is that there are many centers of authority in the society. There is the fellow who owns his own farm, there is the woman who acts as an independent contractor, with a secretary who works for her and two other
                businesses, and there is a corporation with 10,000 employees making minimum wage.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to remove authoritarian power structures, you can’t do this by imposition, because the same state power that attacks the corporate heirarchy also attacks the independent people in the society, who are the most
                important component, and who carry local authority due to their competence and the respect earned by their immdiate peers.

            <p>“No. This is a general(ly meaningless) statement. You “get rid of” structures of power by revolution”</p>
            <p>
                Ok, if you want to define it that way. But to get rid of a corporation, which is a power structure, you just have to drive it out of business. Woolworth is gone, that didn’t require a government revolution. You can get rid
                of WalMart without a government revolution, you just have to reduce its profits sufficiently that it is no longer has the upper hand over local business. It’s margins are large only because of low minimum wage, and
                preferential contracts.

            <p>“The “mechanism granting the power” cannot be completely separate from and external to the power structure itself, it is never “engineered” by some otherworldly and completely “independent” outside actor.”</p>
            <p>
                That is 100% true, and this is why I propose global fixes rather than local fixes. The only things I philosophically admitted to needed a top-down control are tax rates, monetary policy, uniform things that don’t require a

                The global control of tax rates is technocratic, and requires only macro data. The global control of unemployment by monetary policy and stimulus requires only macro data. Philosophically, adjusting macro policy to macro
                data doesn’t admit influence from power structure necessarily, because this is a small enough basket of numbers that the public can be aware of all of them and vote to fix them when they don’t work properly.

            <p>It is not at all easy, but there is no revolutionary solution that ends at this policy.</p>
            <p>“What the hell does this mean?” (regarding contract law and separation of power)</p>
            <p>
                If you look at capitalist contract law, there is a lot of effort expended to determine when you are an “independent contractor”, and when you are an “employee”. The key differentiator is the degree of independence of your
                day-to-day work decisions.
            </p>
            <p>There is a lot of effort expended in knowing when you are a “subsidiery”, a “division”, a “franchise”, or a “competitor”. Again, the key issue is control.</p>
            <p>The fine-grained distribution of control is the central issue that capitalist legal system obsesses over. It is nearly the entire body of law under capitalism.</p>
            <p>
                This haggling is important, because what it is determining is which power structures will be admitted as legitimate, and which are going to be destroyed by government force, or implicitly destroyed by simply the government
                refusing the respect your contractual decisions. For example, Uber was forced to declare it’s “independed contractors” employees, because it was telling them what to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                This legal system is full of precedents about power distribution, in detail, with numbers, with precedents, and it is something socialist theory usually ignores. This stuff is what China was forced to deal with in the late
                1990s, when they wrote their corporate law. It is why the USSR was struggling with fine-division of authority.
            </p>
            <p>
                The policies I suggested work within this framework to nudge the society toward a socialist endpoint. It is much more difficult to do this than to stage a revolution, but the division of power within a revolution reproduce
                the legal struggles in the contract-law courts which have been worked out over hundreds of years. You need to look at these precedents to understand the details of power-sharing under capitalism.
            </p>

                Of course “capitalism” exploited and degraded hip hop, IF by capitalism you mean “large corporations” and “monopolized power structures”. “Capitalism” in the sense of free trade and small corporations created hip-hop. You
                need to distinguish between the two, because free trade does not necessary lead to concentration of power, at least, if you succeed in engineering a system which reverses Marx’s law.

                There is no “center”, or at least, it isn’t at the point of the average opinion of Congress. You are presuming that individual Republicans resemble their representatives. It is no more true than that you are like the
                Democratic party. Republicans consider their representatives guilty of war crimes, like you think of the Democrats.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fundamental overriding principle of the modern Republicans is maximizing liberty of individuals, and minimizing state intrusion. Their “true philosophy” is closest to Ron Paul, and if you look at Ron Paul and Bernie
                Sanders, they agree on a lot of points, especially regarding constitutional protection and foreign policy, where they might as well be the same candidate. They also agree on Fed audits, except Paul calls for zero inflation,
                and Sanders calls for zero unemployment. This is why Sanders can win an election, he is not oblivious to the overriding concerns of another huge fraction of the electorate.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no fundamental conflict between the principles of liberty and socialism, because socialism seeks to maximize liberty also. But both are in conflict with entrenched systems of power. You have to look at all people as
                potential supporters to win an election, which is much more difficult than just picking one point of view and going as far as possible within this point of view.

                The Republican party itself is corrupt enough that it might be past the point of no return for a political party. It might disappear in the next few elections. If so, the Libertarians are going to form a new party, perhaps
                along with the Greens. If not, the Republicans will need to represent a different constituency than the two Koch brothers and the John Birch society.

                without a state any stronger than it is now. That means you can get a consensus for it, step by step, among all sectors of society except those of immense wealth, by elections.

                There are Republican businesspeople who support single-payer, because it removes health-care headaches from their business. There are Republican who support a higher minimum wage. There are Republicans who think the cost of
                college is outrageous, and there are Republican stock-traders who believe that a little bit of friction in stock-trades will stop them from getting ripped off by microtraders. There are Republicans who support anti-trust,
                and there are Republicans who support worker cooperatives.
            </p>

            <p>
                That means, with pressure, it is easy to find a Republican to support any one, or all of these measures, and otherwise be a Republican. Then you can vote this person in, by encouraging Sanders folks to register as
                Republicans and vote in the primary, or else vote for this Republican in the election over the Democrat that does not support Sanders’ platform.

                Exposure to what? Radon? You have the same problem in coal mining too. Uranium is not all that radioactive naturally. The “waste pits” are relatively small in volume, and are simply not dangerous to anyone at the moment, and
                won’t be once you have a good deployment of breeder plants (which are absolutely necessary). Nuclear fuel is very energy dense, and you can store all the waste for its entire lifetime if you do it right.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main problem is that you are using only the .007 naturally fissile component of Uranium, and not doing breeding. That leaves behind 200 times more waste than theoretically necessary, which is also much longer lived— it
                is radioactive for 10,000 years, rather than 300 years. The two solutions to this are Fermi’s fast-neutron plutonium breeders, which use U238-&gt; Pu, and LFTR, which uses Thorium-&gt;U233, but also can use U238 in addition,
                and process the waste to pure fission products. These are only radioactive for 300 years, which is entirely feasable to store safely in large concrete warehouses for the entire time it is radioactive.
            </p>
            <p>
                But we don’t have either reactor online today. Fast neutron breeders were never economical, they suffered from cost overruns. LFTR was just shelved for political reasons, because it was entirely different technology. Only
                one reactor was ever tested. It is now being reexamined, but unfortunately outside the US.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nukes, when done right, have no externalities compared with anything else. Even with the current accident rate (which is atrocious) they are better than the alternatives. With a LFTR, there is not much potential for
                accidents, as there is no pressurized vessel to rupture. A spill per century is better than warming, but I doubt the accident rate will stay high with LFTR, it’s just a better design. That’s not just my opinion, it was the
                opinion of the fellow who designed the light-water reactor people use in the US today, also many others.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no better carbon neutral fuel than nuclear. I am sorry to say it, but it is true. The reaction to nuclear power were a byproduct of the awful nuclear arms industry, which is now best put behind us along with the
                cold war.

                environment than you need to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nuclear is really the only good way, and I shouldn’t say good. It’s great. The problem is that the plants that fission the entire fuel are politically difficult, so people end up storing “waste” that’s 99.5% fuel, and
                waiting for the next generation of plants for 40 years.

                The only way to get rid of independent power structures is to create a totalitarian state. There is nothing wrong with independent power structures, as long as the mechanism granting the power is carefully designed to
                distribute power broadly. This is extremely difficult, which is why Capitalists put so much thought into structuring contracts and deciding when incorporated entities are independent. The struggle between centralization and
                decentralization was fought out on both sides of the iron curtain, it’s not a pure socialist theory, there was progress on the other side too. I put some thought into the prescriptions, and you can certainly argue that they
                aren’t enough. But they are a start. You might need gradual depreciation of property contracts in lieu of taxes to produce gradual ownership distribution, but taxes are probably sufficient.

                It’s not a pipe dream, although I admit there are no real historical precedents in traditional capitalist economies. The best historical precedent is actually the USSR, strange as it seems, because the internal wage system
                was an effective free market, and construction jobs were always available on an open-door policy. This meant that you could see what the wage structure a capitalist economy looks like at zero unemployment, something that
                people don’t talk about, because the communists don’t admit it was an effective market, and the capitalists don’t know anything about the USSR.
            </p>
            <p>
                The wage structure in the USSR was based on mobile labor making choices, and administrators setting wages so as to draw the right number of people to the jobs. It’s a form of supply and demand, except through planners acting
                as intermediates. The availability of jobs ensured always zero unemployment, and the wage incentives were just sufficient to draw the right number of people. At zero unemployment (meaning full on-demand construction job
                availability or other infrastructure job), you must reproduce the exact same wage structure under capitalism, because the USSR was really not all that different from capitalism in its internal structures, except for the
                parts that sucked (the new venture allocation and the state monopolies). The wage structure in the USSR paid factory labor a bit more than administration, and paid hard jobs much more than easy ones that required training.
                Your wage was roughly your productivity.

                a context where one of the major parties is so bought out, it is no longer sane. The conservative-liberal fight is now entirely internal to the Democratic party, as it was in 2008, and Hillary Clinton is the more

                Yes I did. You only need enough people capable of working construction to absorb the excess unemployed. Construction absorbed unemployment when it was done as a policy, in the US and in Germany, and to a lesser extent in

                Because elections are impossible to win openly and honestly, because every candidate, even your favorite, will take positions you strongly oppose, and the opposition candidate who is vaguer will push ads on those issues you
                disagree with. That’s why you need to take a strong stand on a few issues, and leave the rest to the imagination. That’s how electoral politics works, and there’s no solution. You just have to vote of the best candidate
                based on the stuff they are firmly committed to, which will always be a small fraction of all the stuff.

            <p>Sanders lies a lot less than others, because he tends to repeat himself on the stuff he is sure is ok to say instead of lying or going off book. That’s called “staying on message”.</p>

                The strategy is post-election, but a mass movement can’t be organized around ordinary Democratic party talking points. The organzing principle is Sanders’ platform, not the Democratic party’s. The movement doesn’t have to do
                much beyond contribute $40 a month toward ads and make phone calls during midterms, it’s what the NRA does. Nobody can touch a 4 million organization willing to do that, because midterms are so low turnout. It’s continual
                pressure. But it requires two elections, Sanders, and the first midterm.

                Regarding Obama, these are not excuses. It’s what you get with an in-party guy. He needs to work with his dirty colleagues. Obama is slightly further left than the rest of his cabinet, although still a mainstream Democrat.
                Sanders is not a mainstream Democrat, he has his own people.

                Obama shut them down, as he negotiated with Republicans from a position a mass movement couldn’t get behind. Sanders won’t do that. It’s as simple as that. Also, this is the third iteration, people know better how to
                organize online. Obama was similarly better than Dean, who was the first.

                It’s not arm-waving. As president, he will unilaterally break up the big banks, and redirect research funding to solutions for global warming. Personally, I am hoping for LFTR research and deployment, but he hasn’t said
                anything specific about it, and I don’t want him to, because pro or con, it will hurt him politically.

                Rojava and telling Turkey to back off the socialist Kurds. But I don’t know that, and neither do you, so I just ignore foreign policy, while knowing he’ll be better than Clinton and for sure better than any Republican with

                too, if they support the specific programs, they will get ads backing them, and no challengers.

                The Democratic party already did these things in the 40s, and the Republican party did them in the 50s, 60s, and 70s. We stopped doing these things in the 80s, because people forgot the laws of economics, as Marxist regimes

                That’s not how it works. You hire companies to do construction, they find employees, and this reduces pressure on unemployment, as fewer workers are in the job rotation pool. This is standard since the 1950s, it works to
                reduce unemployment, it is uncontroversial.

                He can do that when he has 4 million supporters willing to donate and mobilize in midterms. I am one of 1.3 million, and I expect 4 million before the election is over. That’s the same strength as the NRA, which nobody in
                Congress can safely oppose.

            <p>
                That’s nonsense. It has grown worse because the president can’t pass a minimum wage increase, or pass stimulus to workers in a jobs program. You need to increase the pay of working people to get improvements, and an
                infrastructure program is not something Republicans can support, because they stopped being Keynesian when their donors asked them to.

                In other words, foreign policy is almost always idiotic pandering which can cost you an election, and doesn’t indicate presidential policy at all, as the president can act unilaterally. Bush ran as an isolationist, Nixon ran
                on peace, and Kennedy ran on missile gap. There’s no point in looking at foreign policy platforms, beyond examining the past judgements, and checking if they are marginally better than that of others, a test which Sanders
                passes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Breaking up the big banks is something the president can do both under Dodd Frank, and more generally under the Sherman act, if he can find a reason to consider the consolidation anti-competitive. Presidents are granted a
                lot of leeway in anti-trust, and the last presidents have all been lax.

                He plans to raise minimum wage to $15, spend $1000bn on infrastructure to reduce unemployment directly, and tax trading to finance public college, which reduces unemployment indirectly. He wants to break up the largest banks
                in 100 days, and introduce public single-payer health care, which reduces the costs of both health care and of doing business as well as providing for those without. He intends to introduce true progressive taxes again.
                These push the economy toward equilibrium, meaning wages become more equal, and production increases. Read his platform, it’s specific.
            </p>
            <p>
                He wants to renegotiate trade pacts to tie imports to increased wages abroad, and he supports worker cooperative incentives very broadly and vaguely, which I would suppose means that infrastructure projects would give
                preferences to worker owned business, and there would be more protection of small farmers and small business.

                Sanders isn’t running on foreign policy, although it is probable, although not certain, that his foreign policy would be an advance, considering his positions in the past. His domestic policy isn’t vague, it’s a solid
                advance on meaningfully reducing unemployment, redirecting stimulus to workers, and providing health care and education.

                It’s not all that different from 2008, it’s just going several steps further, for the first time in the direction of actual leftist change. In 2008, we had worse to deal with, and a corporate Democrat was the best thing you
                could realistically elect. Now Sanders is the best you can elect. Next time, it will be more progressive, if Sanders wins.

                I didn’t give an emotional response, I gave a curt response, because your post was long and mostly vacuous. Before becoming disappointed in Sanders, you should vote him in. Become disappointed when he lets you down, not in
                advance. Then find a candidate that goes further on those issues where you were let down, and persuade others to continue the progress.

                Now that I read it, I like the one idea you have in the middle somewhere: a virtual election and a virtual platform online for a political movement. That’s nice, but such an election isn’t for leaders of anything, and it’s
                just in your head right now. It’s not like you are electing a labor representative. You would be forming a minor party online. That’s something to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to do something real with such a party, you can get two dozen volunteers, take some signs, and picket WalMart. Not employees, customers. Demand they pay more money. Tell people not to shop there. They can’t blame
                the employees for a customer picket line, because the employees didn’t do it.

                There is sense in the wariness. Traditionally, FDR redistributionary socialists instituted even more racially discriminatory allocation of resources than the free market. The GI bill discriminated against black GIs, highway
                funding and mortgage subsidies favored rural and suburban whites as opposed to urban blacks, and the suburban subsidies pumped capital and people out of cities. These things were explained in the recent appearance Sanders
                made, where Black and Native voters challenged him.
            </p>
            <p>
                The voters are simply testing to see whether Sanders is serious about targeting high unemployment urban areas. He is assuring them that he is, and he is, so I think he will win over a large percentage of Black vote, perhaps
                the majority. Perhaps not. Voters also need to believe he can win.

                It’s a completely compelling rationale. You can’t split the vote, it is immoral. The split between communists and socialists led Hitler to power. Ralph Nader was running to punish the Democrats for their corporate streak. He
                chose to run against the least corporate new Democrat, Gore. For his trouble, Bush II nearly drove the US to outright fascism. This wasn’t an accident, this is what Nader intended. He was “heightening the contradictions” at
                the expense of people’s lives and livelihoods.
            </p>
            <p>It was legal for him to do it, but that doesn’t make it right.That destroyed the Green party for me, and for a lot of other potential voters. Your party has no ethics.</p>

                This is not a parliamentary system, you don’t get to vote for second-choice, so the only way you can have a third party is if one of the parties is weak in a region. There are regions where this is so, where one party is
                basically non-existent.
            </p>
            <p>If you want a third party, institute instant run-off elections, but they go against the tradition in the US. Otherwise, you need to destroy a party to form a third. The best target is the Republicans, who are weak now.</p>

                Of course he has a foreign policy, and it’s probably a good lefty one. He’s not running on it because it’s not worth his time to make up campaign nonsense to pander. Common political wisdom says voters don’t vote based on
                foreign policy. They just vote if they feel terrorized, and then they vote Republican. So the less he says the better.

                I didn’t give a reference— the best Western reference is Thomas Gold “The Deep Hot Biosphere”, but the theory was originally Soviet, it was due to Kudryavtsev, and it was well established in Russia and Ukraine for 40 years
                already, due to pressure anvil tests, radioisotope tests, Helium contamination, and all the other stuff you will find in Gold’s book. If you look in English, and online, you will just see mockery of the idea by so-called

            <p>
                The idea that we’re about to run out of oil is the Western version of Lysenkoism, it’s nonsense pushed for political reasons. The oil won’t run out, we need to make the transition before we raise temperatures by 5-10
                degrees, we should have done it 20 years ago. LFTR is the best option, in my firm opinion, but you won’t find many leftists who agree, because of knee-jerk anti-nuclear. LFTR not only solves energy, it produces 100 times
                less waste at 300 years of radioactivity, which is completely reasonable to store for the entire lifetime at current storage capacities, or maybe double that.

                He doesn’t say, I am not sure. If you are open to nuclear options like LFTR, it can be done in a period of 10-20 years. If you aren’t, I’m afraid we’re all going to be cooking in our own emissions. But if you come out and
                say “I support nuclear plants”, you are causing political trouble, so I don’t know. I don’t even know if he supports old nuclear or LFTR, or any of it, and I’d rather not know, because it will hurt him either way.

            <p>
                Most of the impositions of power in our lives are through business decisions, not government decisions. You need to decentralize ownership of business, so people have a real choice where to shop, and to make business
                employee owned, so that workers have a say in their conditions, and share the profits.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s already a massive amount of democracy. If the workers then say “we trust Bill, he’s a good manager, we’ll let him make the decisions”, then that’s up to them. They don’t need to keep up with Bill’s decisions, unless
                Bill starts to cheat them of their wages and profits.
            </p>
            <p>That’s democratic enough. If you vote on every sneeze, nothing ever gets done, because everyone has to be taught the details of everything, and that’s impossible.</p>

            <p>
                Yes, of course, it’s still the left. It’s just that I don’t expect to take over individual industry, or regulate the economy very strongly, just restructure the nature of contracts, and modify the tax system to change the
                conditions away from monopolization.

            <p>“I don’t know what a “professional” investment system is”</p>
            <p>
                When you need to allocate capital to new business, this is sometimes done by a wealthy person who invests in a company (an angel investor), for the purpose of increasing their own personal wealth, and sometimes by a
                professional— a banker or VC (venture capitalist) who is paid a professional salary. The individual investor is usually not very good at this, and sometimes hires a professional to do the investing.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a real perfectly competitive capitalist equilibrium, nobody is wealthy enough to individually finanace very large ventures, so you need to rely on bankers and successful VC professionals, the ones with a proven track
                record, who have done a good job with investments in the past.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then if you want to start a business, you bring your proposal to the VC, and if you get one of them to invest in your company, you can build it up, with worker ownership along with your friends, until it is generating some
                millions in revenue. You hire workers, first at a wage, then they build up equity over time, like a mortgage. If you are successful, the VC recoups the investment for the firm, as usual, and you get to share the profits,
                with taxes being paid. The VC is paid a professional salary, and the profits have nothing to do with it, except that if the professional VC is doing a bad job with investment, they are likely to lose their job, and go do
                something else.
            </p>
            <p>
                As your firm gets larger, with more paid employees and fewer owners, the progressive taxes get bigger, so at some point, you will want to split, either horizontally or vertically into independent firms, with new owners and
                fewer employees. In this way, you keep the economy decentralized at all times.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the USSR or Hungary, new investment was done by a GOSPLAN bureau, and if you did something radical or new, and it outcompeted with existing industry, unlike a VC, you would be destroyed politically, and you would lose
                your job. Not always. But often enough that it killed all innovation. This is why VC needs to be decentralized, not politically controlled from the top down.
            </p>
            <p>“There were other issues beside the inefficiencies (which, btw, still can’t really compete with the inefficiencies of capitalism – just not hidden nearly as well)”</p>
            <p>
                This is entirely false, capitalist production was in every way vastly more efficient than Soviet production, despite its inherent inefficiencies. You simply need to look at the record of Soviet production to see that there
                was no comparison between Soviet firms and Western firms in the case where Western firms were small and competitive, and even in the case where they were big and competitive. The Soviet industry never changed anything, they
                were still using vacuum tubes in the 80s. You couldn’t change anything, because you couldn’t go to an independent VC, you needed to go talk to the local party boss, who would say “transistors? Why do we need transistors.
                Vacuum tubes worked for 20 years.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The same inertia happens in large firms. It doesn’t happen in small firms. The example of Yugoslavia (and Hungary) is illustrative. The Hungarian and Yugoslav economies were more competitive, because they left small business
                alone.
            </p>
            <p>“the very real competition with imperialist capitalism, which was always a violent threat, from its birth.”</p>
            <p>
                Blah blah blah. I am speaking about the USSR in 1980, not in 1930. By the end, you got to see what happens to large state industries. The West is not so dependent on “imperialism” as you put it, except for oil and raw
                materials. The USSR found plenty of oil, because they understood oil better than the West. The production in the West is outsourced now, but it wasn’t in the 60s and 70s. There was no real threat in 1980, except for the
                threat of nuclear war, and nuclear bombs are relatively cheap compared to the destruction they caused.
            </p>
            <p>
                I mean, the USSR could have led on nuclear power plant design, but they didn’t. They could have led a LFTR program, or a PACER project, but these were done by the West. The USSR was a world leader in research, and it had the
                best education in the world. It was the power structure of business which was screwed up. You couldn’t do anything independently. This is why socialism must be decentralized.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are blinding yourself to the failures of the USSR, which are repeated in other nationalized industries everywhere they are tried, and ALSO repeated in Western private monopolies, to a lesser extent. If you want efficient
                business, make sure it is a network of small competitive business, so that employees brains are used to their full potential.
            </p>
            <p>“I’m not sure that (beyond the formal freedoms) a poor inner city black person has a better chance to innovate and create something new than a worker had during Communism”</p>
            <p>
                Look at hip hop. The Black American experience has always been highly entrepreneurial, I have neighbors who sell meals, sell toys, sell everything, although their efforts are always hampered by lack of access to capital. In
                cases where Black entrepreneurs were locally successful, like in Rosewood, they were destroyed by lynch mobs.

                I didn’t bother with the points we agree on, which is most of them. The only point of disagreement is the central control. If you introduce central control, you destroy evolvability, because central control is incompatible
                with change.

                The same is also true of business. That’s why you need trustbusting and a graduated corporate income tax. Generally, any imposition of power on a far-away group of people should be taxed, including franchises and chains. If
                you want local decision making, the target should be big business.
            </p>
            <p>
                One problem with decentralizing government is that it often comes with centralization of business. As long as there is a strong incentive for decentralized business, government can do that same, because local issues are best
                determined by local populations.

                Not exactly comfortable, just able to be heard. It equalizes the power of propaganda, so that people can do propaganda with efficacy equal to corporations. But propaganda is not enough, you also need policy, and you need
                leaders. The internet organization tools of Dean and Obama turned internet organizing into votes for a presidential candidate. Sanders is taking it to the next level, in my opinion, by turning it into a popular movement that
                can influence Congress directly, by money and turn-out-the-vote. It’s gradual. The next iteration will be even more powerful.

                Oh yeah, I took my baby daughter there a few times. It was very nice as a protest, but it wasn’t anything like the well organized civil rights movement. They worked like dogs with a determined leadership, and they sent out
                folks like Rosa Parks and MLK to do specific actions to get visibility. They weren’t making a human megaphone and brainstorming in large crowds.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am suspicious of masses of people. I accept mass movements when the people choose leaders they trust and hold them accountable, not when they try to run things by direct democracy. Direct democracy is very erratic, and
                doesn’t produce good policy, or even coherent policy, and it is determined by the person who sets the poll.

                A heirarchy managed from below is not a problem. An example is professors appointing a Dean for their department. This is not tyranny. the Dean doesn’t control the professors, the professors bound the actions of the Dean.
                The issue of tyranny arises when the far away owner appoints managers over distant employees. It’s not a real heirarchy of power, it’s division of labor into management and other duties.

                The problem with secession is unified monetary policy. The Fed and Congress can pump money from NY to Mississippi, and without this, Mississippi and most red states would turn into Greece. Aside from monetary union, and

                When the workers own the business, they can choose to appoint managers, or not, they can vote on an equitable salary for management positions, and they can vote to let them go if they aren’t doing a good job. They share in
                the profits of their own labor, and they can choose to set aside capital for future expansion, in order to increase their production. They can also delegate the setting aside of capital to hired managers, who don’t get to
                keep more than a fair salary for their capital management function. It’s not the same as current capitalism.

                People aren’t “too stupid”, they have incoherent opinions in a mass! You can’t make a popular average of opinion polls and come up with a coherent policy. For example, if you ask “Should we get rid of Obamacare?” you’ll get
                majority “yes”. If you ask “Should we repeal the affordable care act?” you’ll get majority no. That’s why politics isn’t easy, people don’t come together to make an organized “mass opinion” in any simple way. Whenever
                someone is claiming that they are representing “the people”, what they mean is that they are representing a faction with a coherent ideology that aims to replace the individual decision making power of all the citizens.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s why decentralization is important. You need to make sure that different people can use their own judgement to better their own environment. It’s also why power is important. You have to make sure the people can change
                anything that affects their lives. It’s the Newton’s third law of politics— no effect without influence. “No taxation without representation” in the language of the country’s founders.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t want Oligarchy. I want Democracy. But that’s not the same thing as holding a popular vote on how much toilet paper I am allowed to use to wipe my butt this morning. Maybe I had a problem which is none of your
                business. Maybe not.
            </p>
            <p>
                Democracy involves decentralizing decision making so that small groups of individuals are in charge of their local environment, and larger groups are in charge of their larger environment, by selecting leaders, and debate,
                and discussion, and responsive leaders. That’s what socialism means— that workers can control their place of work, and share in the profits of their labor equitably.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you say “the people rule”, what you do is that you select leaders in a movement, the movement purges dissenting opinions, and the leaders decide for everyone. That’s not Democracy, it’s not socialism, it’s what happens
                under Leninism.

                They are unable to support an attack on the electoral system, designed to marginalize the left. The left was already destroyed using violent revolutionary movements once, in the early 1970s. By the end of the decade, you had
                a bunch of drugged out revolutionaries killing a Brinks armored car guard. The situation regarding revolution is only worse today, when revolutionary movements can’t communicate without being spied on. It’s simply a trick to

            <p>
                yes, you are right. But the existing degree of state power is sufficient to bust up the power in monopolies. It is sufficient for encouraging distributed ownership, and it is sufficient to make a real professional investment
                system independent of a parasitic class of capitalists.
            </p>
            <p>“Large companies are extremely efficient at concentrating power”</p>
            <p>
                Yes, they are efficient at concentrating power in a few hands. But they are extremely inefficient at the business of companies, which is producing products and services at the lowest possible labor. That’s why the USSR went
                bankrupt, because they immitated the power structure of capitalism, and ended up with horrible oligarchic concentrations of power and an inefficient economy.

                I understand the analysis perfectly well! It is correct— when you trade property deeds, they concentrate in a few hands, leading to unemployment and subsistence wages for wage labor. The result is a concentration of all
                business into gigantic state level monopolies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point is that it can be reversed with systematic policy, because those deeds granting property rights are constructed by government, and corporations only follow money. That means that if you encourage splits with
                financial incentives, you will get splits. If you encourage transparent contracts and competition, you reverse the bias to big business. If you make incentives for broad worker ownership, you get broad worker ownership. In
                net, you reverse Marx’s law, by creating those conditions where the law works in reverse.
            </p>
            <p>“Lies about Marxist-Leninist states make those claims, not the experience”</p>
            <p>
                It is not a lie to claim that the USSR couldn’t produce a decent home computer, or a decent refrigerator that didn’t weigh a thousand pounds. Or a decent camera that didn’t fall apart. Or glossy books and magazines, or new
                fasions that didn’t immitate the West, or new toys. Their music was derivative, their art was boring and censored. When they had innovation, like the Rubik’s cube, or Tetris, it was through small people who were suppressed
                by the bureaucracy, and prevented from bringing the product to the masses.
            </p>
            <p>
                None of this is lies. It is due to the concentration of power in government. This is why people oppose Marxism-Leninism. If it weren’t for this, the world-wide revolution was on its way to completion by 1930, except people
                looked at the USSR and said “NO THANKS”.
            </p>
            <p>“It is not a “solution” because between an existing concentration of power and a non-existing one, the one that actually exists will win in the end.”</p>
            <p>
                That’s simply false. There was no Linux in 1992, it didn’t exist. It fought against corporate machines as big as the biggest ones in any economy. It was able to build up from nothing to full power in two decades. The rest of
                the transformation should follow this lead.

                As the ownership gets distributed, the system becomes less capitalist, and more egalitarian. That’s what Americans know that Europeans don’t, since ownership of land was widely distributed in the 19th century. Europe had

                Venezuela was a wreck when Chavez was elected— they had 60% poverty and 25% deep poverty (people living in garbage dumps). Chavez cut deep poverty by more than half, and poverty by half, and doubled Venzuela’s GDP. That’s
                why people voted for him and his party. Now they are very corrupt, and people vote for the opposition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chavez had completely different policy from Sanders. He wasn’t a libertarian, he was authoritarian. Chavez was a classic anti-business Marxist and he destroyed small business. Sanders supports business strongly. Chavez’s
                main economically positive move was to nationalize the oil industry and spend on the poor, but that counts for a lot in Venezuela. It counts for nothing in the US, which is why the US will never elect someone like Chavez.

                Sanders is an FDR Democrat who is supportive of small business. Corporate power is not good for an economy, healthy small business is good for an economy. It has a further plus that small business is usually significantly
                worker owned. Americans remember when people owned their own business, and they want that for the future. This is a form of socialism, except we didn’t know enough to call it that.

                You don’t need to REQUIRE something that everyone already wants. You just need to encourage it and protect it, until it is the new norm. Socialism is NOT about government force, despite what you read, and despite
                Marxist-Leninist thinking. Socialism means “workers have a say in controlling their place of work”. You don’t need or want a “dictatorship of the proletariat” for that to happen, in fact, a dictatorship of the proletariat is
                pretty much the only way to guarantee that it will never happen. You need Democracy, good ownership laws, and a gradual transfer of ownership to many.

                Of course the trend is away from worker ownership! That’s why you need to reverse the trend. That’s the whole point of libertarian socialism, and what makes it the opposite of Marxism-Leninism. Those large corporations are
                inefficient monstrosities, and need to be split up.

                I am not an anti-Marxist pseudo left. I read Marx, and I read Lenin. I DISAGREE with the idea that large concentrations of power are inevitable, and the way to prevent them is to bust up the power structure with structural
                remedy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason it goes the other way is that power naturally concentrates. To break it up, you need a graduated corporate income tax, as a supplement to anti-trust law, and transparent contracting reform, to prevent false
                splits. You need distributed ownership encouraged, by gradually transferring equity to employees, and if it’s a publically traded corporation, you need to prevent employees from owning equity in the corporation.

                The problem with the right is that whenever they see power, they assume it has roots in government. They can’t understand non-governmental power. But that goes away with self-education, which happens naturally online. Then
                the Trump supporters become Sanders supporters.

                Sanders doesn’t believe THE GOVERNMENT should own the means of production, but he believes THE EMPLOYEES should own their own workplace, at least eventually. That’s real left, and more progressive than Marxist-Leninists ever
                were. This is also supported by many right wing libertarians, believe it or not.
            </p>

                Sanders supports worker-owned cooperatives, and wants to encourage these forming. That’s the only part of his platform which is actual socialism, although it is a modest first step. This step is also supported by the RIGHT,
                believe it or not, and has passed with a moderate conservative government in the UK already. Don’t kid yourself, workers owning small companies is real socialism, and it’s real libertarianism, and everyone can support it,
                except the Marxist-Leninists, who really should grow up.

            <p>You can’t win an election on truth. Can I say that 9/11 was an inside job and win? I can’t. Even though it is true, and even though most people know it is true. That’s politics.</p>

                The competitive wage structure at zero unemployment is basically the wage structure of the USSR, more or less. It’s not obvious, but the compensation system under the planners was indirectly implementing free market wages.

                I am not a moderate in that sense. To address inequality you need to make sure investment comes from banks, not individuals, and that individual income is progressively taxed. Then you need zero unemployment. The rest takes

                You have no idea what kind of measures can be implemented from the moderate left, when they get their act together and decide to eliminate unemployment and inequality. They can shift companies to employee ownership by
                various tricks, they can forbid insider ownership as insider trading, they can break up monopolies. They can reduce unemployment to zero by jobs programs, and raise wages for everybody. These are a road to a better society
                by other means than top-down imposition.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea that there is a magic road to employee control is probably an illusion. You need to do it by building cooperatives, and supporting them, and not buying things at places which are run top-down. There’s no easy path
                using pure state power, as the state is corrupt by nature.

                That’s incorrect. Carter halted the Kissinger, COINTELPRO nonsense and introduced some human rights considerations into foreign policy. Clinton introduced expanded EITC, and led anti-trust against Microsoft. Obama reversed
                torture policies and several authoritarian measures, although he kept too many.
            </p>
            <p>Sanders will reverse ALL the authoritarian measures with 100% certainty, including the warrantless wiretapping and Patriot/Freedom acts. That’s a guarantee.</p>
            <p>
                I am not an idealist. I support Sanders because I am a realist, and one can’t live with the Nixonian state of the Democratic party, and the insanity state of the Republican party. I believe Sanders can allow the Republican
                party to finally die, as he appropriated all their sensible libertarianism into his own platform.

                herself be destroyed. That makes her a martyr, not a direct agent of change. She might become an agent of change in the future, and a martyr is something to be also.

                You must never do politics from your own perspective alone, no matter how justified. You do politics from every perspective, including those which are on the right, because those people have little bits and pieces of truth

                Be conscious of the political reality. Sanders has challenged foreign policy to the utmost limit possible for a Senator, and even a little beyond, as the Iraq vote and leading the opposition set him up to be turned into
                Cynthia McKinney. She was only a little more opposed than Sanders, and she was completely destroyed (I’d like to see her reelected). Sanders did about as much as possible while staying in the system.

                Foreign policy is impossible to challenge unless you are already president. Nobody knows what foreign policy a President will enact, except going on general principles that the candidate espouses. So I would say you should
                be optimistic regarding Bernie Sanders foreign policy, even in cases where his voting record seems to disagree with you so far. Remember that Kennedy ran on “missile gap” and Nixon ran on “peace”. Foreign policy is usually a
                bunch of pandering lies, which might be why Sanders talks about it so little.

                Although I agree with most of this, at least the parts not bashing Sanders, Sanders politcal movement is not a phantom. It’s similar to the Bull Moose party that formed around Teddy Roosevelt, except it’s entirely within the
                Democratic party. The goal of the movement is internet fundraising and organization to unseat Congressional members who are standing in opposition to reform. It can be successful because voter turnout is low in midterm
                election, even on the Republican side, and even a modest mobilization and get-out-the-vote effort can unseat an incumbent. That’s why the NRA has such power, because they show that they can pour money into local elections
                when they are displeased. The Sanders movement has membership comparable to the NRA, or will by the time he is elected, they have better fundraising than the NRA, and will therefore have comparable power to modify the tone
                in Congress. This is not a joke. It is very difficult for people to stand up to the NRA, so they don’t bother. Why would they stand up to Sanders, when he has mobilized support?

                Boy is it not nonsense. You’ve never lived through hyperinflation. I have. You go to the store, and prices are higher every day. They are higher at the end of the day than at the beginning of the day. You have to spend your
                money in the morning when you get paid and buy all the stuff you need for the rest of the month. Quickly. Before everyone else buys everything out. People’s decisions cause this problem, and people’s decisions stop it. This
                problem is understood today, and can be controlled, the procedure to remove accelerating inflation was worked out in the 1980s.
            </p>
            <p>
                Economics makes predictions for numbers. Unemployment, price inflation, production, labor, consumption. These predictions are based on laws, and these laws are difficult to work out, more difficult than physics, because you
                can’t really do controlled experiments very easily. That means you need to extract the predictions from uncontrolled messy experiments.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a further problem that the field is politicized, so that the best insights are not admitted into academic discussions for political reasons. The most important insights are microeconomic equilibrium and response
                theory, this is due to Adam Smith and Ricardo and other early 19th century people, macroeconomic failures due to Marx in the mid 19th century, and macroeconomic fixes of these failures, due to Keynes, in the early 20th
                century. There are other minor contributions, but that’s pretty much the whole story of capitalist economics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The political problem is that Marx is completely taboo, so you aren’t allowed to mention him. Keynes wasn’t allowed to mention him either. So Marx is ignored by everyone, except those that ONLY read Marx, and ignore the
                other two pillars. That’s not a good situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a way out of the impasse regarding controlled experiments, but nobody does it. They are all afraid for political reasons of what they will find. But it is essential to know. What I said on this page is mainstream
                Keynesian thinking, except without disguising the Marx portion, as is traditional.

                The Kremlin is very hard right today, it does try to make “The West” look bad sometimes, but it has no serious ideological difference with the USA. All the good stuff on RT is just independent internet people who are
                rebroadcast because they are critical of something or other. Pravda had a consistent, although humorously antiquated, ideology.

                When I say “employ everybody”, I don’t mean pay an exhorbitantly high wage so that literally every person is employed. I mean offer construction jobs at a livable minimum wage near enough to every community so that there is
                no realistic possibility of destitution. There will still be a certain small number of people between jobs.
            </p>
            <p>This is all that a full employment policy requires— a good infrastructure program that absorbs any excess labor, so that nobody is out there driving down everyone else’s wages by not being able to find any job at all.</p>
            <p>
                The reason the unemployed don’t come together to start a cooperative is because it is impossible, as they lack capital. They will huddle together in a homeless camp, building structures out of cardboard, and begging for
                money. These activities pay far less than minimum wage, and involve more suffering and labor than construction.

            <p>Regarding the second part of your comment, about Keynesian spending and the competition between public and private jobs.</p>
            <p>The model you have is the classic “Phillips curve” idea that when you provide jobs, you need to increase the wage to draw more people.</p>
            <p>
                This is not really what is going on, as the unemployed in the society are people actively seeking a job to protect them from destitution. They will usually take a job at practically any wage. Those who won’t are not part of
                the unemployment problem, they are normal job seekers who are between jobs and have a good resume.
            </p>
            <p>
                The people who hold down wages for everyone are the people who can’t get jobs because there aren’t any jobs to get. The point of Keynesian road construction, public works, is to employ all those people, so that there aren’t
                any of them left.
            </p>
            <p>
                These public works projects are not exactly a loss-making corporation, they are just public projects, so that their value is determined by the labor sunk into them, since they are government paid. The point of “0%
                unemployment” is to have an open door policy on such projects, so that anyone who is broke and needs a job can always go to the construction office and get a reasonable job at a wage that becomes the effective minimum wage.
                It’s their choice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because it’s their choice, the wage, as long as it is below the inflationary minimum wage, will cause no inflation at all. You CAN get inflation if the wage for these jobs is very high, as in the case of Nixon paying high
                wages for military production, without employing construction workers. But this is the exception not the rule.
            </p>
            <p>The point of Eisenhower and Nixon was to get rid of unemployment. Eisenhower did it the same way Hitler did, with road construction and miltary spending. Nixon doubled down on military spending.</p>
            <p>
                The Clinton way to do something similar was the EITC, which increased tremendously in the 90s. Martin Luther King Jr. favored the plan I just said— an always available low-paid (but still living wage) public sector option
                for employment. This can replace minimum wage regulation, the wage for the job is always the effective minimum wage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because the wage is relatively low, it doesn’t take out anyone who can find a better paying job in the private sector. Instead, just like a minimum wage hike, it raises the minimum that an employer must offer to get an
                employee. This does not harm the economy, as I explained before.
            </p>
            <p>
                This policy makes unemployment moot, because you can always find a construction job. That’s the way to drive unemployment to 0%, it is historically effective, there is no unemployment in societies with open construction
                projects where people can willingly sign up.

            <p>Whoa, this discussion finally gets somewhere! Thanks for the original points.</p>
            <p>
                Regarding socialized medicine, remember that it is a baseline insurance. It covers catastrophic care, basic regular checkups, basic sickness, basic dental, and there is still space for a market on top, since this is a basic
                plan.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point of covering basic care is that the patient is held hostage to the hospital in many cases of basic care, and cannot negotiate from a position of strength or from any position at all. The doctor both prescribes the
                treatment and then doles it out, and then bills a third party as much as he/she wants. The third party is then in a bind, because if it doesn’t pay, the doctor can accuse the company of killing the patient, and lawsuits
                would put it out of business.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you have single-payer socialized medicine, the baseline care is taken care of by a government that refuses to pay more than a certain amount for the lifesaving care, and also makes difficult choices regarding which care
                is actually lifesaving, and which care is just an extraneous boondoggle. The government is the only entity that can make a call like that without getting sued.
            </p>
            <p>
                This puts the hospitals and providers in a situation where they are not able to use the coercive aspects of their business to charge outrageous rates, as the government is stingy, and reimburses them their costs plus a
                reasonable rate of depreciation on their capital, and no more. Private insurance then is free to negotiate above the baseline.
            </p>
            <p>
                This type of negotiation is vital for health care, because it is a situation where there are expensive options that are only marginally better for the patient— like a cancer drug that extends life by a month or two, without
                much benefit. The government plan does not have to reasonably provide this benefit.
            </p>
            <p>Now a private plan can still provide additional coverage for such things, and they will charge market rates. There will still be market insurance, it will just be supplemental, after the coercive parts are taken care of.</p>
            <p>
                The situation is analogous to a famine. In a famine, government regulates the food supply, so that people don’t gouge the consumer, and the distribution is equitable. Any surplus food is left up to the market to allocate.
                The same holds for essential basic care, vs. additional care. Health care is more coercive than other industries, and forms an exception. That’s why basic care is governmental in all modern societies except the US.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s all I have to say about government medical insurance. It increase economic freedom, because people are not tied to a job anymore, and employers don’t have the headache of insurance. All the countries which score
                highest on economic freedom provide state medical insurance to all their citizens, and that’s a plus for economic freedom, not a minus.

                Price inflation has no relation to money supply inflation. That’s a consequence of Keynesianism. There was not a three-fold increase in prices in 2008 and 2009, the rate of price increase was a few percent, as always. This
                is another catastrophically failed prediction of the Chicago school.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keynesian economics is the same as Marxist economics, except without the prescriptive part, where the government take over all the big business. The fault Marx identified in capital markets is that unemployment causes wages
                to plummet. To fix this problem, Keynes suggested zeroing out unemployment. That’s all there is to it.
            </p>
            <p>It’s obfuscated, because normal economics academics are not allowed to mention Marx for political reasons.</p>

                That’s what you’ve been taught, but it’s not true. Socialism simply depends on workers owning their own business, like small business, and libertarianism means the government doesn’t tell that business what to do through
                regulation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only major role for government in the economy is to break up concentrations of power that stop this natural state from existing. That’s it. It can be done with gentle nudges, like progressive corporate income tax, and
                incentives for gradual worker co-ownership, like profit sharing, and regulation on publically traded corporations, to prevent powerful executives from sucking profits into their own pockets..

                I know how governments are run. Single payer is not very bureaucratic, it’s a simple reimbursement scheme. Insurance is very bureaucratic, because there is negotiation for each procedure, and conflict on what is necessary
                and what is not, which usually happens after the procedure is already done.

            <p>
                The point of single payer is to hold down costs when there is a market failure. The way to know the costs is by providing reimbursements at diminishing rates, until the supply starts to fall and private insurers step in to
                fill the gap. That’s why you need a mixed public/private system.

                Keynesian economics was attacked politically during stagflation, because non-Keynesian people didn’t understand how inflation worked. Conservatives also used a voodoo version of Keynes based on the “Phillips curve” instead
                of reading Marx.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keynesian economics is not disproved by anything. It’s just a fact of life. Stagflation means you need more investment, that’s all, and a jobs program in the meanwhile, because your economy can’t employ everyone as it
                stands.

            <p>
                You think I don’t know that? You need to look at how the central planners were acting. They were acting as market intermediates in this case of wages in the USSR. This is not how investment or innovation was done there, that
                was pure planning. But the wages were essentially pure market, despite the planners. Nobody said that internal to the USSR, by the way, that they were using markets. They couldn’t on ideological grounds. I noticed that.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1965, they wanted to move to pure market planning for all industries, based on profit. This plan was shelved. It was reintroduced in Gorbachev’s time, in 1985. Thestate industries were supposed to operate at a profit now,
                as opposed to by quota.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because they were all enormous state monopolies, the easiest way to raise money was to choke the supply, to hold off on orders. This meant that as soon as market reforms were implemented, shortages began, and they just got
                worse as the USSR became more market oriented. Then it collapsed, and the industries were privatized, producing an oligarchy overnight.
            </p>
            <p>
                The failure was the centralization and monopolization. The “calculation problem” was not serious. This is something you don’t understand until you look at the USSR deeply, not just read Mises, who never studied the planned
                economy deeply.

            <p>
                Banks creating money out of nothing is just a way to produce investment capital for new industries that doesn’t rely on inequality and a bunch of rich people telling others what to do. There’s no need for angel investors if
                you’ve got a good VC and a good bank. The money doesn’t go to individuals, it goes to build up businesses, whose profits are distributed to employees through their labor, and to pay back the interest on the initial loan.

            <p>
                The planners acted like robots— if they had a shortage, they raised the wage, if they had a surplus, they lowered the wage. It’s no different from a market. They didn’t tell people where to work, they needed flexible labor.
                This system was set up in the mid 1930s for the first five-year plan, it was codified in the second Soviet constitution (the Stalin constitution). I looked into this, because I had no idea how the heck they could regulate an
                entire economy top down. It was mystifying.

            <p>Under Reagan, it came from a bunch of rich people. Under a free frictionless market, it comes from bank loans.</p>
            <hr />
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                The point is that the salary the planner set was equal to what it would be in an ideal frictionless market, because if there were too few people in a given job, they would raise the wage for it, until they got just enough
                qualified applicants. When there were too many they would lower the wage. That made wages differ by a factor of 4-10 throughout the USSR, it was not an equal-wage society by any means.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s not a market, but the mechanism is exactly the same. Actually, if you want to see what free-market wages would look like at zero unemployment, I think the USSR is your only example. There is no other economy that
                operated at zero unemployment with this type of wage system.
            </p>

            <p>
                Stagflation happens when there is not enough existing infrastructure to employ everybody, and you stimulate the economy to the point of hyperinflation. Then you get inflation at a rate of unemployment determined by the
                amount of industry you still need to build to employ everyone.
            </p>
            <p>To get rid of stagflation you need new investment. But when there is inflation, it inflates away the investment capital. So you need to pump money into banks, but that has the effect of making the inflation worse.</p>
            <p>
                So the plan is to first get rid of inflation, by austerity, which is what Carter did with Volker, then to reduce taxes on investment capital, to allow new industries to form. That’s more or less what Reagan did. Except he
                did it with an orgy of tax cuts and consolidations that didn’t help anyone at all. Carter and Volker were the wise minds here, not Reagan.

                Look, I know how the USSR worked. They had internal prices, which rose and fell according to supply and demand. They weren’t stupid. Their labor allocation was nearly an ideal free market. Everyone could switch jobs, and the
                planners set the salary to draw the appropriate number of people in, providing rather large incentives for tough jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The prediction Mises made was presuming that the planners would be too stupid to mimic a market. They weren’t in the USSR, but conservatives don’t know anything about the USSR. The price signals in the USSR functioned as a
                signal of scarcity just as it does in a market.
            </p>
            <p>
                The failure of the USSR was in bureaucratic inertia, and lack of innovation, and it happens in market systems as well in enormous firms. You are just blind to it when it’s MicroSoft releasing the same crappy version of
                Windows year after year, or if it’s an IPad still not working with flash. Those are enormous concentration of power making horrible decisions, and that’s what you had in the USSR, on steroids, because it was all government
                monopolies.

            <p>
                It’s like saying “statics is at odd with dynamics”.Microeconomic theory is based on an equilbrium state, so that you can predict responses to perturbation. The dynamics of actual industrialized markets drive it away from the
                equilibrium state, when ownership concentrates and unemployment appears. That’s just the facts of life, and it is quantitatively demonstrated by the response of unemployment to minimum wage which goes in the exact opposite
                direction you would predict.

                Sort of. It’s approximately true for new industries as they are developing, not for old ones, and it’s not even true for all new industries. That’s Mises schtick. It has nothing to do with the failure of Marxist-Leninist
                economies. The failure is one of centralization, not economic calculation.

                Oh I get it! You are saying because unemployment is the sum of individuals looking for work, there’s no possibility of a conflict between micro and macro, because a drop in unemployment is due to some individuals finding
                work in their micro environment.
            </p>
            <p>Well, that’s true in a vacuous sense.</p>
            <p>
                The correct way of saying “macro and micro conflict” is the statement that the macro response to a change is not equal to the sum of the obvious micro-responses, due to nonobvious feedbacks due to spending changes, which you
                can’t predict without knowing the features of general economic equilibrium, and how close or far you are from it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason that the micro changes can all seem to go one way, while the actual macro change goes the other way is that the market is not anywhere close to economic equilibrium. The response theory of microeconomics presumes
                that you are at equilibrium. The failure of the theory shows that you are not. It’s as simple as that. Conservatives deny that this is true, but economic equilibrium makes precise predictions that fail. One of them is that
                unemployment must go up in response to an increase in minimum wage.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main cause for not being close to equilibrium is that the wages in industrial economies are depressed due to unemployment from their equilibrium value. When you fix this depression, by a jobs program, by minimum wage, or
                by whatever means are required to remove the unemployed from the picture, wages rise to productivity, and equilibrium is restored.
            </p>
            <p>The lack of equilibrium is the most important feature of real markets, and you are blind to it.</p>

                I don’t know what a “macro measurement” means. Macro and micro are theories of responses, not theories of measurement. The UE is measured by unemployment benefits, I presume. I don’t care how it’s measured, so long as it’s
                accurate.

                Yes they are at odds. A rise in minimum wage should increase unemployment and reduce total consumption according to every micro reasoning, yet in real life, whenever it has been done, it does the opposite. That’s entirely
                due to macro reasoning. You raise minimum wage, and unemployment goes down. There’s no micro explanation for this, no matter how hard you try to spin it.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are unfortunately the economic illiterate. You only understand micro, which means you are missing out on the last 80 years of economic thought. I’m sorry, but you need to learn the basic laws of macroeconomics, and you
                can’t learn them unless you start by reading Marx. That’s not going to be possible for you, on ideological grounds, so, you’re just “fukked” as you put it.

                The Fed was not the impetus for the housing bubble, the banks were, when someone realized how to defraud buyers of bundled securities with a false rating. There was no failure of government, the failure was entirely in the
                private sector.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason interest rates are low is simply to encourage people to borrow money at low interest and hire people. It’s not happening, because there are no more consumers, and small business is squeezed out. The benefit to
                investors is a side effect. It what happens when you try to do stimulus but don’t have the political will to invest directly in a jobs program.

                This is complete nonsense. The housing bubble had nothing to do with homeowner support regulation, or any such thing. It had to do with the mortgage bundlers realizing they could make a fraudulent AAA rating for the bundled
                securities, by a false assumption that the defaults were statistically independent. This meant that they could make money from a credit default swap, which would be underpriced.
            </p>
            <p>
                The demand for more mortgages came from the bundlers, who were selling them off to banks like Goldman Sachs, would would pass them off after insuring them. The banks then went crazy giving home loans, because they were
                essentially being paid to produce subprime mortgages.
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole failure was entirely in the free-market part of the system. None of it had to do with government. I know this is impossible for you to believe, because of your philosophy, but it is true. This is why your

                NHS monopolized British health, and I believe it is too restrictive in comparison to other national plans. It is one of the earliest plans, it was designed at a time when the importance of competition wasn’t appreciated as
                well as it is today. We have more experience now, and public/private mixes are best.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want care that is not provided, it is essential that you can freely buy it, so that the doctors are able to sell their services beyond what the state is willing to pay. That’s what normal non-NHS health systems look
                like. In such a system, there can be no compaint of rationing, because you can supplement the state insurance with whatever private insurance you wish to buy, just as you do today.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no reasonable claim of rationing in a public/private mixed system as in France, whatever you can pay for, you can get. It’s just that the government provides a floor on essential care, and prevents prices from
                skyrocketing in those cases where the hospitals are in a position to extort the patient.
            </p>
            <hr />

        <div>
            <p>The thing that makes reasonable negotiation impossible is that the care is essential, and choice is out the window. It’s a very precise standard: can the patient say “no” and be ok?</p>

        <div>
            <p>
                If by “rationing” you mean paying $100 for an MRI rather than $800, paying $10 for a pill rather than $190, and disallowing frivolous overtesting when young children are in a hospital, you are right. If by rationing you mean
                that people won’t get essential care, you are wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you feel that you are being rationed out of care you want, just pay for it. The government doesn’t need to pay for everything you want, just the minimum consensus for what will keep you alive, at prices that allow the
                hospital to operate and recoup costs.

                It’s not what you call it that makes a difference. It’s whether the patient can reasonably negotiate regarding the location, price and type of care that is the issue. In both pregnancies and road accidents, the negotiating
                power of the patient is nil. So the hospitals can do whatever they want, and bill the insurance company after the fact, and the insurers can’t say no.

                That’s not true. Voters are extremely skeptical of government spending, especially in the US. They know that if it gets too big, it comes at the expense of private sector growth. The thing about health care is that you are
                improving small business, because they no longer have to worry about employees getting covered. That’s what some Republicans support national health, and even Donald Trump spoke out in favor. He knows his hotels and casinos

            <p>
                A national health system just means that the government negotiates the maximum possible lifesaving care within its medical budget, while the public buys the supplemental care if they aren’t happy with what they are getting.
                That’s the only way to keep the lifesaving care from driving up the costs of everything else.

                The level of bureaucracy needed for government payment is far smaller than that required for private insurance. The reason is that the government sets a uniform payment rate for the esential care, determined politically. The
                issues of maximizing copays and denying care is taken off the table, and private insurance can focus on optional drugs like viagra, or on hair-implants or something. Nonessential stuff.

                Artificially raising the cost of labor creates real value, because that cost is depressed by a non-market mechanism, by the creating of unemployment and the prevention of competitive wages. This is not controversial anymore,

            <p>
                That’s what makes lifesaving care so difficult to provide, you can’t hold down costs in the market. The supplemental insurance and optional care is different, and for these a market is good. That’s what they do in France,

                Right. But the single-payer takes out all the middlemen, and leaves only the doctor and a stingy government for essential care. This holds down the costs on essential care, and sets the baseline for nonessential and
                supplementary care provided by a market on top of the basic care. It saves a ton of money. The French system is at least 30% cheaper than the US system.

                He funded it correctly, and the reason it only hurts a little is that there is a large progressive tax component to it, although the bulk is from general taxes and payroll tax. It’s a mix, and it’s a sensibly designed mix.

                Mexico, if not for the corruption. Sanders has always been rather stingy on new immigration, he just doesn’t want a shadow economy with underpaid people, because that’s a de-facto guest-worker program, something he opposed,
                because it drives down wages.

                The things Bernie are making “free” have a value that is already created, by health-care providers and hospitals. The only question is whether the payer is getting their money’s worth. In both these cases, the answer is no,
                as in the case of health care the spending is through the roof due to limited information for the consumer, and in the case of college, the spending is through the roof, because college is a ticket to a high paying
                profession, so you can charge the difference in wage.
            </p>
            <p>Both of these cost overruns are anti-competitive, which is why it makes sense to subsidize college, and have a base of government care which takes care of lifesaving medicine. That’s why other nations do it.</p>

                And I repeat it. The government could have zero deficits tommorrow if it directed the Fed to print money and then taxed this money as it entered banks. That’s not a good thing to do, because it encourages irresponsible
                government spending and that can lead to hyperinflation. This is why the Fed is independent, and why government finances itself through taxes, not through printing money.

                work, because Bernie Sanders doesn’t believe in government control of industry. That means the Republicans will not be busy making a positive message, and that means they will lose, and they will be mystified when they lose.

                The nation didn’t prosper under Reagan. Unemployment was relatively high, there was a crash in 1987 you forgot about, and there was a deep recession in 1991. Only he wealthy prospered under Reagan, as the low-inflation
                climate allowed investments to grow. The low inflation was engineered by Volker in 1978-1982, and he was a Carter appointee. Unfortunately, the wealthy voices are the only ones you hear on TV, so wealthy people doing

                The nation did prosper under Clinton, and that was largely due to Gore managing a tech revolution. But even then taxes went up, and a tenfold rise in EITC was introduced to redistribute wealth. The internet boom was managed
                so that it would produce thousands of small companies, rather than Reagan style large monopolies. Bush ended all that, and started the consolidation wave that destroyed the internet economy. It is not clear to me that if the
                trust-busting Gore was elected that the internet economy would have ever crashed in 2001. It crashed as investors realized those small companies wouldn’t be protected from monopolization.

            <p>
                Like Reagan, Bush cut taxes, monopolized industry, and entered and left with a gigantic recession. Except Bush also shredded the constitution, engaged in covert activities both inside the US and abroad, and left a deeper

                starvation level, I-live-in-a-garbage-dump poverty. While Venezuelans today suffer from oil-price shocks, and toilet-paper is difficult to find, Chavez reduced deep poverty by more than 50%, and poverty by 50%, and the

                It’s worse than that. Because the wealth transfer is so successful, rich people have tripled their incomes in the last 40 years. So they also tripled the amount of tax they pay, while everyone else’s tax payments are
                stagnant. Wallace is saying “if the rich are so good at rigging the system, why do they pay three times more taxes today?” It’s because they have rigged it to get three times more income!

                China is not a communist country anymore, it hasn’t been since Deng Xiaoping. It is an authoritarian crony capitalism on the coast, with a heavy state control of many large industries in the center. Both Republicans and
                Clinton admire the way China can control its internet. While Denmark had market Socialists in power at one point, the current government is rather conservative. But even the most conservative politician in Denmark would fit
                within the more left parts of the Democratic party economically, because they are all Keynesians.

                His successor would likely be Elizabeth Warren. American “socialism” doesn’t involve state coercion or takeover of industry, it involves reducing the power of big business. The libertarian is strong in Sanders, and it is
                generally stronger on the American left than on the right. Witness the Patriot act, the Freedom Act, and who voted for it.

            <p>Sanders has a 25 year Congressional career, he’s already as corrupted as he’s ever going to get, which is not very much. Compromise and picking your fights is not the same as corruption, and he’s done plenty of both.</p>
            <p>
                He’s already got an ego, don’t kid yourself. He’s not a weak guy, he’s the only independent Senator on the real left in Congress. He doesn’t have to formulate policy, he can hire good staff, which he obviously does better
                than anyone else, just look at his policy papers and commercials. The only thing he has to do is keep his moral compass under pressure. That’s not so hard if you are used to it, FDR could do that, and he was a pampered child

                It’s only in comparison to other candidates that Sanders looks like an incorruptible saint. In objective terms, in world-politics terms, or in historical terms, he looks like a reasonable center-left politician with a lot of
                talent for politics, and a bit of a libertarian streak. I don’t expect him to be perfect or incorruptible, just incorruptible enough, which he is.

                Companies don’t get enormous by gradually making more money, you deluded pisspot. The way companies get enormous is through IPO shoving billions down their throat, or by being founded by a billionaire, and then using that
                capital for acquisition of all potential competitors. That can’t happen with Disqus, because Facebook and Quora already took the monopolist capitalization for that niche.
            </p>
            <p>
                When companies grow gradually, in an environment which is friendly to competition, they never become too powerful or too big, because new competitors constantly emerge. To deal with the situation of already monopolized
                business, I support a graduated corporate income tax, to punish big corporations for their size, and encourage them to split.

                Exactly! There are competing effects with a minimum wage hike, like you said, and ALL the obvious ones go against the prediction I said. So it is extremely difficult to know what the net effect is on the economy from
                marginal microeconomic considerations like you are making. As you noted, every microeconomic analysis you do suggests that the effect of minimum wage hikes is to net DECREASE net spending and INCREASE unemployment and REDUCE
                spending in net. That’s why Friedman and other Chicago people say “Minimum wage is bad”, and it’s why it was opposed throughout the 19th century by economists.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s what makes the Keynesian prediction regarding minimum wage and unemployment INTERESTING and IMPORTANT. It’s completely counterintuitive from a point of view which doesn’t understand macro. That makes it a unique
                prediction, a unique quantitative prediction, and these are essential for testing a scientific claim of any kind, as they are strict tests. It’s like the General Relativity prediction for the precession of Mercury’s orbit.
                It’s something you can’t predict without understanding the full theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point of Marx is that there are certain macro-effects regarding the lowest wages which you can understand just from knowing the theory of the wage structure of economic equilibrium, and knowing about the existence of a
                class structure and unemployment. The wages are MUCH lower than they would be in economic equilibrium, and consequently the profits are MUCH higher (they are zero in equilibrium). The way to determine whether the net effect
                of a policy is increased or decreased production is then simply the question of “does it move you closer to equilibrium” or “does it move you further away”.
            </p>
            <p>
                From ANY micro-perspective, minimum wage is moving you away. It is only from a macro-perspective that you see it is moving you closer— it’s the global unemployment and class structure that it is attacking, by partially
                fixing the wage distortion that it produces. So ONLY Keynes/Marx would tell you that raising minimum wage slowly has the effect of decreasing unemployment.
            </p>
            <p>That’s an effect that is verified with regularity with every minimum wage hike. It is why Keynesian economics was accepted without question and without controversy from 1940 to 1980.</p>
            <p>
                When there is institutionalized inflation, you don’t need a rich person to put away money in a bank to get investment anymore. You just need to raise capital in banks by creating new money. That’s another aspect of Keynesian
                economics, removing the dependence on wealthy individual investment by having a global monetary policy.
            </p>
            <p>Both of these things were recognized and institutionalized around the world decades ago, including in the US.</p>
            <p>
                The reason it was rejected in the US is because of stagflation— the existence of nonzero unemployment at stimulus sufficient to produce accelerating inflation. The claim was that “this disproves Keynes”, because, as the
                conservative people saw it, in Keynes, you can’t have inflation until you reach zero unemployment.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s only true in Keynes if you have the infrastructure to employ everybody. When you get stagflation, that means you need more investment capital and an immediate government jobs program, because even at full capacity,
                not everyone is employed. That’s what Carter and Reagan were all about— reducing inflation with austerity, and increasing investment capital.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem with Reagan’s policies is that the increase in investment capital came by increasing inequality, and allowing wealth to concentrate among the already wealthy, so that they could finance new ventures. That’s the
                recipe for monopolized gigantic business, not new small business. A more decentralized view is to increase bank capital, and encourage small business, and break up the big business. That’s pretty much what Obama and Sanders
                are all about.

                It’s not about quantity of money exactly, it’s about size. Disqus is a competitive little counterweight to big corporations— it’s a small nimble company taking on “Quora” and “Facebook” and other billionaire ventures. They
                can’t make too much more than 10 million a year, because it is relatively easy to compete with them, e.g livefyre etc. You really don’t get it. I like competition, I like independent small business, I like employee owned
                business. I don’t like monopolized big business run from the top down.

                “appreciate” == “understand” in my comment. Sorry, I didn’t appreciate your point properly. When you said you aren’t voting for Sanders or Clinton, I thought you meant you would vote Republican. You’re voting Green, ok,
                that’s great. But I think you are too pure, but, hey, it’s your vote, and I’d vote Green too if this were a parliamentary system.

                When you have a certain fraction of the white vote totally racist, and a bare majority of the white vote totally oblivious to issues of racism, it’s a hard issue to fix from the top-down. The NAACP and Civil RIghts Movement
                worked from mass marches, and civil disobedience, not from the top. Sanders is running to head a mainstream party, and I think he is taking his advocacy for disenfranchisement as far as possible for a winning election
                campaign, and I think his candidacy a near-miracle, so I don’t challenge him. I think he would be the best ally in the white house, of all those that could realistically win. I don’t want to argue with someone on the same
                side, I just hope you don’t live in a swing state.
            </p>
            <p>
                Look, if you take Sanders at his word, as I think you can, it is clear he wants constant activism busting his ass, and everyone else’s, from everyone with a grievance. The best time to do it is right after he wins. That’s
                the only way anything happens anyway. But the Green party is not going to help any more when one of the major parties is crazy. I think it is important to knock the crazy party out before setting up a challenge, because
                that’s the only way to get a transformation in the party system the way it is set up today.

                would ever face the situation of looking for work indefinitely. This was his main economic platform before he was assassinated. The war on poverty had some meager successes, some social failure, but a war on unemployment is
                what MLK proposed, and I follow MLK not LBJ. Because MLK was a Democratic Socialist, while LBJ was a war stimulus president.

                Sanders wasn’t representing Texas, he wasn’t running for Texas Senator. He didn’t choose the depository location, and like every politician, he has to consider not just whether he abstractly agrees with a concern, but
                whether the fight is going to be fruitful for his constituents at the time. Now that he’s running for president, I expect him to take on this fight, to make sure that abuse of minority communities like this never happens. I
                just don’t expect it of him as a Senator, because it’s not his state. These were not his constituents.

                The details are largely the same, although the policy intended is opposite. Ron Paul wants a zero inflation policy, Sanders wants a zero unemployment policy, but both agree that having a “whatever big business wants” policy
                is atrocious, so the support slides back and forth rather easily.

                I’m 42, and I assure you that you have NEVER been there before. Sanders is not a “very liberal” candidate, although that is how he appears to a Democrat. He can be thought of as a true libertarian leftist, and a Republican
                or Independent can smell the libertarian streak from a mile away, whether in his stance on guns, or on abortion, or on descheduling marijuana, or on NSA surveillance, or the Patriot act. This is an unprecedented election,
                and an unprecedented opportunity to win over conservative libertarians to the Democratic party in droves. Please don’t blow it.

                I can tell you with 100% certainty that independent of the poll numbers or Repubican nominee, Sanders is universally more well liked among independents than Hillary clinton. He sweeps independents in his state partly because
                until recently, he identified as one, and he understands their concern with the corruption in the party system. He is honest, and he cares about the best policy to improve people’s lives, that’s his only overriding concern
                (after winning, which he must care about a whole lot, or else he wouldn’t win).
            </p>
            <p>
                They can overlook a ton of disagreements for this trait. It should be universal in public service, and it used to be more common, but now it is pretty much just Sanders. Heck, he should capture some Republican vote,
                especially small business owners who want to be rid of health care worries, and Ron Paul supporters who want the Fed audited, NSA spying to end, and the Patriot act in the dustbin of history.

                It’s worse than that. She doesn’t actually believe it, she just pretends to believe it, always with ambiguous wording, just so as to get the JFK-conspiracy vote, or the UFO vote. Nobody else usually pays attention to such
                statements, and ambiguously supportive statements can flip a percent or two your way in a close election, and you can always deny them afterwards. Romney did the same thing regarding cold-fusion when he visited Utah 2 days
                before the 2012 election. Romney doesn’t care about this, he probably thinks the cold fusion people are nuts, he’s not a physicist.

                That’s regardless of the actual merit of the wacky idea, as JFK was actually assassinated in a conspiracy, Pons and Fleischmann did see anomalous results reproduced by several other groups, although what these results were
                due to is unknown, and while no, aliens didn’t come down to visit farmers, there seems to have been some active disinformation planted in the media about UFOs to make gullible people believe that they did.

            <p>Ok, ok, I didn’t know anything about it! It’s news to me. I just read your link. Sorry for being dismissive.</p>
            <p>
                Let me explain myself: I don’t defend the choice of repository site. I agree it’s rather scummy the way nuclear waste is passed around from district to district until it ends up in regions with people who are granted less
                political power on racial grounds. I think it’s a goddamn shame on the US.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t agree with this structural racism, of course, but I am also sure that Sanders doesn’t like any structural racism either. But he’s not a saint, he’s a politician, and he chooses his battles, and he decided not to take
                this one on, for his reasons. I suspect that the reason is that nuclear waste, unlike a light-water nuclear reactor, is simply an issue of public fear, it’s not at all dangerous to the residents, no matter where it is. I
                wouldn’t care at all if there were 200 tons of nuclear waste in a concrete bunker directly under my house, so long as the trucks carting it in weren’t too noisy.
            </p>
            <p>
                There’s no way it can change my vote for him, because it simply wasn’t an issue of corruption, nor an issue of lack of action to protect minorities. It was an issue of Sanders making up his mind NOT to fight on an issue
                which I frankly think is not a top priority.
            </p>
            <p>But honestly, I didn’t know anything about this until I read the article in the link you provided, thanks.</p>
            <p>
                I will repeat that nuclear waste is simply not very dangerous, it’s not actively fissioning, it’s not a reactor, it can’t melt down, it’s not a power plant, it just sits there, being hot and radioactive for 10,000 years, and
                as long as it’s in a big concrete room, nobody needs to worry about it, other than making sure the place isn’t leaking water, and moving it around when the political winds change, until it can be used as fuel for the next
                generation of reactors (see below). It’s not like Bernie Sanders chose the site, or designed the repository. He just voted whatever people in his state wanted him to vote regarding the issue, because he decided that transfer
                was not worth his political capital in opposing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I personally agree with his decision, although, of course, as president, I would like to see him move aggressively on assuring the public that ACTUALLY hazardous material is never going to be dumped in minority communities,
                and I also hope he ensures that residents of Hispanic communities have strong negotiating power in government. It’s just that, honestly, I don’t see how this stuff is realistically going to be hazardous to anyone, no matter
                where you put it, despite what the public thinks about it. Although, of course, I wouldn’t presume to make that call for other people.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a policy issue, to deal with the fear, perhaps the nuclear regulatory commission can compensate homeowners who live within a certain radius of a nuclear waste storage facility for the lowered property values due to the
                perception of danger, and agree to monitor the water and air for radioactivity continuously with automatic systems to assure the residents, even if there is no danger, just to allay the perceptions of danger.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the bigger issue, one which Sanders has said nothing about, because it’s not an issue in this campaign so far, the main question is “what do you do with nuclear waste?” This is a central issue with nuclear power, and it
                makes the current designs of nuclear power plants unsustainable.
            </p>
            <p>
                The correct answer is to move aggressively on research and deployment of brand new LFTR plants, which are a completely different design using Thorium as the main fuel, and a low-temperature unpressurized flouride fluid for
                the fission part. This design was produced and tested in the 1960s in the US, but now all the research is going on in China, with a little peripheral research in India on related matters. The US needs to take this issue on
                again, because the nuclear waste of a light-water plant is the fuel for a LFTR, and the LFTR converts all the uranium to plutonium, and fissions it, leaving behind only fully disintegrated fission products, which unlike
                standard nuclear waste, is much more radioactive and so decays much faster. It is only radioactive at appreciable levels for 300 years. The amount of waste per unit power is cut by a factor of about 100, because you are
                using up all the nuclear fuel in a LFTR.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was always the plan, to use the waste as fuel, but that plan got shelved when the fast breeder reactors got scuttled for various reasons in the 1970s and 1980s. These were difficult to design, and at the time, it was
                cheaper just to store the waste indefinitely, because it’s not such a huge volume. But of course you can’t do that forever, at some point the storage costs are going to be significant, especially when people are annoyed
                about the stuff. That’s why LFTR is much more promising, because the tested design was obvious and easy, and has none of the safety issues of current nuclear plants, as it doesn’t use a pressurized dome, and it is not
                particularly good as a nuclear weapons program, it is just the easiest scheme to generate fission power in a breeder.
            </p>
            <p>
                LFTR is cheap and easy, and I personally think it should be a no-brainer. I have no idea what Sanders’ position on LFTR is, if he wants to solve the global warming problem, I hope he studies the issue, and decides to support
                the project. With a LFTR, the current storage facilities, or maybe twice as much, would permanently contain all the nuclear waste you would ever make for it’s entire 300 year radioactive lifetime (nuclear waste is very small
                volume).

                McGovern was an easily smeared candidate who was the archetypal nanny-state liberal. He converted the food-nutrition programs to eliminate hunger in the US into the “food pyramid” nonsense when they were about to run out of
                funding, due to their success. He was running as a negative income-tax welfare candidate at an extremely racist time with an electorate who was considering segregationists. He was running against the last Republican
                Keynesian. He was a better choice than Nixon, bu that’s not saying much. There were better candidates than McGovern in 1972, they were just taken down by the Nixon machine. McGovern was partly taken down by more conservative
                Democrats, who planted the “acid, amnesty, abortion” meme. He was an infinitely weaker candidate than Sanders.

                I am not repeating Republican talking points exactly— the insight about the Oklahoma City bombing and patcon is not Republican specifically, and I figured it outthe Oklahoma city thing for myself, without reading anything,
                thank you very much. The Republicans hardly ever bring any of this stuff up! They have 9/11 to worry about. Right wing media only brings it up in conspiracy websites which run this side by side with UFO stories and quack
                medicine.

                The Republicans take TRUE unethical Clinton behavior, and try to convert it into allegations of illegal activity. Clinton isn’t stupid. She insulated herself from illegality by plausible deniability, you won’t ever find
                something illegal. But you will find tons of things that are unethical to an extent that should disqualify her from the presidency, were not the Republicans so much worse. She genuinely believes that dirty politics and dirty
                tricks are required to win, becuase she was running at a time when the public was against her policies. Sanders is showing her that it is not so— the level of dirty tricks you need is extremely small, and you don’t need to
                sell your soul anymore. Not now that voters can verify statements online, and a majority are actually on your side.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clinton is a candidate in the mold of Nixon, she is not afraid of dirty politics, or taking dirty money. If she is the nominee, I will have to vote for her, and then take a stiff drink. But there is no excuse for nominating
                her— not when you have a good candidate.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason she is weak in the general is the corruption. It’s not made up. Political blindness and political attack isn’t confined to one of two sides, although the Republicans are worse. You are blinded by your partisanship
                from seeing the corruption of your own candidate. Not everyone on your side is similarly blind.

                her, and then drink a stiff drink.

                I already know these things, and they are nonsense. I am glad Sanders is sane on guns, I want gun rights protected. I changed my mind on this issue right after the Sandy Hook shooting. I was a gun-control supporter before
                that. But after Sandy Hook, I will not vote for a politician that supports stronger gun-control than Sanders does, because I don’t approve of internal psy-ops, even those pushing policy I like, like Sandy-Hook. Sandy-hook
                made me ashamed to be a Democrat, and made me regret my vote for Obama (although the opposition was far far worse, as always).

                Pretty much everything the RNC says about Clinton is true, with the exception of her being secretly more left than she is. The Republicans are even covering up the worst Clinton stuff, because they copied it to do even more

                I have never been a Republican, I was a Marx-reading youth, the only propaganda I had to shake off came from the Communist East (I eventually shook it off). I voted for Gore, enthusiastically, I still hope he is Sanders
                choice for VP if Warren is not. Had I been able to, I would have voted for Bill Clinton over the worse opposition. I haven’t watched a TV since 1994.

                I will urge you to review the Oklahoma City bombing, in light of 9/11. There was an ATF drill at the same time as the attack, and thousands of ear-witnesses reported two separate explosions. The structural damage is not
                consistent with a truck bomb, as internal columns were severed. The materials for the alleged bomb came from sources suspiciously close to internal covert agencies, and the event was part of a “Patcon” political operation
                which is now declassified and exposed.
            </p>
            <p>The Republicans are NOT all over this, because they copied it in 9/11. The Oklahoma City bombing was the pilot for 9/11, and nobody says it, not on the left and not on the right.</p>
            <p>
                I am sorry, but this is not propaganda. It is not even mentioned among 9/11 truthers, at least not often. The Oklahoma City bombing is the mother of all subsequent false terrorist attacks,including London 7/7, Oslo, Madrid,
                and all the remaining smaller nonsense. It is also the soft underbelly of all this stuff, it is easiest to bring the perpetrators to justice.
            </p>
            <p>I can’t in good conscience support this kind of thing, and trust me, no Republican will touch this with a ten foot pole, as they are guilty of a thousand times worse..</p>

                The “Keynesian multiplier” is what you read about in economics books, because they refuse to discuss Marx. The proper way to say it is “getting closer to equilbrium” or “getting further from equilibrium”. Raising minimum
                wage gets you closer to equilibrium, because in equilibrium, people are making their productivity, not 25% of their productivity. That’s the end of the discussion.
            </p>
            <p>
                The minimum wage rise comes out of profits the owner takes home. Those profits would be zero in equilibrium, beyond the amount required to replenish capital and pay themselves a median salary. To start a new business, you
                would need to go to a bank.

                Marxism was full of propaganda in 1973. I just read Marx, I wasn’t a Marxist, so I didn’t get so much propaganda. It’s not exactly an alternative view, the predictions of Marx for the wage structure in unregulated markets
                are just true, and are accepted by all the mainstream economists who aren’t stupid.

                It doesn’t have preferential contracts with one business or another, it pays all businesses the same amount. There are very few practices that don’t accept medicare, but some don’t accept medicaid only because of class
                consciousness— they don’t want poor people sitting next to their clientelle. The 50 cents on the dollar reimbursement needs to be universal, and I guarantee you that small practitioners thrive in public health systems, as I

                You don’t understand national health care. It doesn’t contract with business, it pays the bills directly. That’s 95% of his “grow the government” proposal. His miltary budget would probably redirect money from the
                traditional big contractors like Haliburton and Lockheed Martin, toward universities and research centers. He is not a big fan of these enormous corporations, that’s the whole point of his campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
                The contracts for road building, and bridges, are contracts with relatively small business, unless a big bidder forces their way in by corruption, and they are done by bid. I can assume that Sanders would show preference to
                worker cooperatives, because he proposes to create more of those. Construction is not at all a big-player game.
            </p>

                To help small players in medicine, national health means that they don’t have to worry about which insurance company will provide reimbursements, or haggling with a thousand different negotiators from each company. National
                plans have standardized fees, so they would only haggle on the supplementals. Also, hospitals are much better at gouging medicare and private insurance, as they don’t have a personal connection, and love to over-test and
                over-treat. National health care eats at hospitals more than private practice. I assure you that national care is good to private practice, because the phenomenon you see of private practices disappearing is unique to the
                US.

                His policies and goals are libertarian and socialist, and he would have been shot in the USSR, as all the libertarians were executed early. You don’t know anything about the USSR, or about the type of Democratic socialist
                that helps small business. Small business in Europe is protected from predatory behavior, unlike the US. That’s part of what government is for.

                The shill is strong with you. He didn’t lie about anything related to the data breach, you are a lying liar. He told the complete truth about a non-issue. The endorsement thing is an issue of using quotes out of context, and
                using logos to indicate “I support X” rather than “X supports me”, where there is potential for confusion. It’s not good behavior, but it’s nothing serious. The “ringers” were supporters wearing union pins to indicate their
                support of the union, alongside Sanders badges, and then a Hillary shill in the union disingenuously says “you’re impersonating union members!” Hillary has people in these unions since 2008. Sanders specifically went to the
                union to explain the dirty trick, and they sorted it out in minutes. It’s all a crock of crap, and it’s unbelievable that anyone woudl fall for it, especially considering that all of it, even if true, is nothing compared
                even to “travelgate”, and that’s the mildest provable Clinton malfeasance.

                3. Do you think it is reasonable to blame her for the Oklahoma city bombing, or was she just complicit without being responsible?<br />
                4. Do you think that those complicit in acts of terrorism deserve the death penalty, or just a long prison sentence?<br />
                5. What do you think of the gun-control push Clinton led in light of Patcon?<br />
                6. Do you think that a person who thinks space aliens visited farmers should be disqualified for the office of President?<br />
                7. Given that Hillary has recently suggested that space aliens visited farmers in Iowa, do you consider Hillary Clinton disqualified?
            </p>

                Your simplistic formula is only true when government and business collude, as in the military industrial complex. It totally misses that he isn’t “growing the government” in any way that involves contracts with large
                business, or coordination with business interests.

                He is taking over health care, which gets rid of several big players, and makes small players more competitive (due to health care being portable), and he is providing family leave by taxes. He is also breaking up big banks,
                and enforcing anti-trust law, and instituting progressive taxation. These policies don’t involve subsidies to large corporations, and they don’t involve corruption or collusion. They are simply nudging the economy toward
                economic equilibrium.
            </p>
            <p>
                His policies are libertarian, in the leftist European sense. They can be supported by a person who wishes to see the reduction of concentrations of power. This is why he is my ideal candidate— he understands concentrations
                of power, and he knows how to usethe existing degree of government power to get rid of private concentrations of power most effectively.

            <p>
                He is not just a libertarian on social issues. He is a libertarian on economic issues as well. It’s just that the American idea of libertarianism has been corrupted to mean “let big business consolidate arbitrarily, and
                collude with government without limit”, which is not at all what it’s supposed to mean, or what it meant originally.

                It’s a rare generation whose “specialness” consists of undoing fifty years of progress in economic theory. There was also (outside Italy, the USSR and California) some regress in physics, a ton of regress in philosophy,
                regress in mathematics. It’s amazing how much damage a bit of snorting and smoking can do, although honestly, most of the damage was due to monopoly in TV/radio/newspaper media, the drugs only harmed individuals. On the
                other hand, there was progress in string theory, and some progress in anarchist thought, and after the internet came along, it’s easy to explain the old stuff to new folks. That’s what I’m doing here.

                You think I don’t know whose absurd definition you were quoting? Milton Friedman is an idiot. All his quantitative predictions have failed, and he is a laughingstock in quantitative economics as far as I am concerned. The
                fact that he has a Nobel prize is an indictment of the economics “Nobel” (which is not really a Nobel). By his definition, we had 300% inflation in 2009, even though prices rose only a few percent. Aristotle style
                quantitative failures like that is why people don’t take your side seriously anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
                The “law of supply and demand” fails spectacularly in the case of minimum wage and unemployment. That’s one of the greatest COUNTERINTUITIVE quantitative prediction of Keynesian economics, which no Chicago-school person can
                make, and which is routinely verified whenever minimum wage goes up.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason it works, the reason you can increase the price of labor and yet get higher demand for labor, is because the economy is operating at nowhere near economic equilibrium. When you raise minimum wage (slowly), you
                increase consumption by more than you increase the price of labor, until you reach the point of maximum employment, at which point you just produce inflation.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is counterintuitive, I admit it, but it was predicted by Keynesians, and the counterintuitive prediction was verified in every single one of the many dozens of minimum wage hikes in diverse economies around the world.
                This is the reason minimum wage was instituted, and the reason Australia has both a higher minimum wage ($15/hour) and a higher median income, and lower real unemployment than the US, despite the lower productivity per
                worker in Australia.
            </p>
            <p>This is the great triumph of Keynesianism, making correct counterintuitive quantitative predictions. That’s how we know the theory is sound.</p>
            <p>This fact is ignored by Milton Friedman, which is why I ignore Milton Friedman, and so should you.</p>

                The point is uniform policy to reduce the power of both government and big business at the same time, until both are superfluous, because the structures in place are self-sustaining with broad-based ownership of capital and
                diffuse political power. I wrote a blueprint for how to move forward on this, which you can find by googling my name + nonbureaucratic socialism.

                Carter’s recession was necessary to remove inflation. In Israel, it was “Peres austerity”, and it removed hyperinflation in the early 80s. This is the advance in monetary policy of the 80s, and it came from the left. Reagan
                did nothing of value.

                Hayek and Friedman are not serious, they are buffoons. They make wrong predictions, regarding the change in employment when you raise minimum wage, regarding the amount of inflation when you do stimulus by monetary
                expansion, everything. They are just propped up by right wing money.
            </p>
            <p>
                The “philips curve” is a bastardization of Keynesian economics. The proper term for Keynesian economics is “Marxist economics without Marxist statist prescriptions”, but that’s a mouthful, so I just say “Keynesian” for
                short. Economics is a bought field, and you aren’t allowed to say the name “Marx”, so the most important analysis is buried and hidden, and everything is obfuscated, but the result of using Marx’s economics but just removing
                the “state takes over everything” part is Keynesian theory.
            </p>
            <p>The Philips curve is not a prediction of Keynesianism, it’s something philips made up to describe a true effect by a bogus quantitative claim.</p>
            <p>
                The true effect is that when you have the infrastructure to employ everyone, and you introduce a policy perturbation that moves you closer to equilibrium, you employ more people! When everyone is employed, and you try to go
                further, you produce inflation.
            </p>
            <p>
                To illustrate the effect, imagine you are increasing minimum wage. As minimum wage goes up, purchasing goes up, and people get employed to satisfy demand. When you can’t employ any more people to satisfy demand, you have to
                increase prices instead. At this point all your infrastructure is exhausted— you are employing as many people as you can. If your infrastructure is enough to employ everyone, unemployment is zero now.
            </p>
            <p>The point is that stimulus reduces unemployment until the point it produces inflation. The “philips curve” is a silly attempt to make the intuition quantitative. It is true in a sense.</p>
            <p>
                The point of stagflation is that there just wasn’t enough infrastructure to employ everyone, even at maximum stimulation in the mid 70s. To produce new infrastructure, you need investment, but the stimulation was producing
                inflation, which was reducing investment capital by inflating it away.
            </p>
            <p>
                That means that you need to increase bank capital, and start a government jobs program to absorb the remaining unemployed people. But that was politically impossible. So the thing that was done was to reduce inflation, and
                allow inequality to increase, so as to allow infrastructure investment to go up, until the unemployment could be absorbed. That’s what Reagan’s “revolution” was about— you needed more investment, and Reagan could only see
                investment coming from wealthy capitalists at the top of large corporations, or from new corporations that would get financed by wall st. investment.<br />
                You see that stagflation didn’t prove “Keynsianism was wrong”, it simply proved that philips didn’t understand Marx. Most Keynsians are hobbled by the inability to speak about the Marxist foundation of their field, I am not
                hobbled. The events of the 1970s were simple— there was no more investment capital due to inflation, and stimulus couldn’t fix unemployment because there was not enough infrastructure to employ everybody, and not enough
                investment capital to make the infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>I didn’t read a book to explain this, it is obvious to anyone who read Marx and worked out Keynes for himself.</p>
            <p>
                Also, it justifies Reagan to a large extent, because you really did need more investment back then. But right now, you need to move back to equilibrium. It is also not clear that the investment model is the right one. With
                appropriate banking stimulus, you should be able to increase infrastructure to the point where a regular stimulus will bring you to 100% employment before inflation sets in.

            <p>There are two different definitions of capitalism, I will distinguish them and use different terms for both:</p>
            <p>
                1. Existing capitalism— this is the legal system that allows individuals and organizations to freely trade ownership of various abstract deeds for land and physical property, which grants the owner power over the use of that
                land and property, with the goal of using this property to create more property by employing wage labor.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Theoretical capitalism or “competitive frictionless market equilibrium” — this is the situation described by Adam Smith, Ricardo, and other economists in the 19th century, which is an entirely theoretical mathematically
                precise model. This model makes the claim that every service has infinitely many suppliers in tight competition, every purchasing decision is rational, and all prices are then rigidly fixed at the intersection of supply and
                demand.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I talk about capitalism, I am talking about 2, theoretical market equilibrium. This is something one can understand, as it makes a bunch of extremely precise predictions about the structure of payments and prices, the
                structure of ownership, and the response to marginal changes in prices when an entity like a government makes changes. The result of a market operating according to “capitalism 2” is perfect Pareto efficiency, completely
                distributed capital ownership is stocks, and nearly equal salaries, which differ only in relation to individual worker productivity. This is why Adam Smith advocated capitalism— he was thinking about the point of perfect
                equilibrium.
            </p>
            <p>
                When YOU talk about capitalism, you are talking about 1— a system of free exchange of deeds of property. The result of this system is not the equilbrium of 2, but the concentration of property deeds in a few hands, through
                buyouts and consolidation.
            </p>
            <p>Since existing capitalism (1) is different from theoretical capitalism (2), that means there are some predictions of market equilibrium theory which are not obeyed. What part of the theory fails most obviously?</p>
            <p>
                The answer is that when the deeds concentrate, the owner can raise prices and siphon off profit, due to power. Once that happens, the economy is not operating at pareto efficiency, because the worker is slightly underpaying
                the employees. Then the employees can’t quite buy the full production, which means some employees become unemployed (again, this never happens in 2). The unemployed workers compete with the employed, and drive down wages to
                the lowest possible value consistent with staying alive. Then the economy really crashes, and even the owner isn’t making a profit anymore, because nobody can buy anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the situation described in Marx. It is a failure of existing markets (1) to reach the equilibrium point (2).<br />
                Of course I read Marx, although not all of it. I read The Manifesto, Capital I, and various online and collected essays. I didn’t need to read most of it, as I worked out the mathematical models myself, after taking a course
                in microeconomics in high school, and working out the math in a few hours (it’s easy compared to real math or physics or anything).
            </p>
            <p>
                The main point of Marx is that the existence of abstract ownership of capital separates people into two classes— those who compete for jobs, and those who own capital and do not work. Those who own capital do not pay the
                wages equal to the productivity, because of the fact that there is unemployment. This means that they accumulate profit beyond the amount required to replace their capital and pay interest and dividends, and this profit is
                lost by the workers. This means the workers are making less money than they would in capitalist equilibrium.
            </p>
            <p>The problem with your point of view is that you take existing markets described by (1) and treat them theoretically as if they were theoretical markets described by (2). This means you make completely wrong predictions.</p>
            <p>
                For example, you claim that a person flipping burgers doesn’t produce enough to justify a $15/hour wage. How would you know? Do you know what the price of a burger should be in competitive equilibrium? How would you know
                what that price would be? You only know the real price in real markets, where there is a corporation or owner taking profits on the burger store.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you imagine a situation of zero unemployment, where the worker has the option of doing other things, like working in construction, or whatever, but with no chance of becoming destitute, this worker can demand a
                competitive wage, rather than being forced to take a minimum wage. Under these conditions, hamburger flipping is rather boring, rather tedious, and nobody wants to do it. So in a competitive equilibrium it would probably
                require a salary relatively high compared to say, being CEO of GM, which is a high prestige position which involves using your brain. Heck, I know a lot of qualified people who would PAY to be CEO of GM for a year or two,
                rather than take pay.
            </p>
            <p>
                The equilibrium wage of a worker is the wage at zero unemployment, and at this point 2, competitive equilibrium, indeed, the wage they draw is equal to their productivity. But when you look at real markets, point 1, you are
                not at zero unemployment, and the distortion impacts workers who compete with unemployed most directly hardest. This means that their pay has no relation to their productivity. Their productivity could rise by a factor of 2,
                and their wages would stay exactly the same, only corporate profits would double, and the concentration of deeds in the hands of a few people would get worse, as they now have even more capital to buy deeds with.
            </p>
            <p>
                The economy of the US today is operating at point 1, and the ideal is to operate at point 2. The way to make markets like 1 look like the equilibrium in 2 is to get rid of unemployment. Then workers can demand as high a wage
                as is equal to their productivity, and profits plummet to nothing, and people become equal through market mechanisms of competition. That’s what Adam Smith was arguing for, and it’s also what Karl Marx was arguing for.
            </p>
            <p>Marx made no mistakes in his analysis. His remedy however, was not to remove unemployment, but to take over industry by the state. This remedy is disasterous, and must not be used.</p>
            <p>
                Despite the disaster, the Soviet Union operated at 0% unemployment from approximately 1934, when the last unemployment office closed during the first five year plan, to 1991, when it collapsed. The labor policy in the Soviet
                union was actually close to point 2, it was just that the bureaucratic nightmare of regulating an economy from the top down led to the worst possible inefficencies you can imagine.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not a Soviet style socialist, I believe in distributed ownership. There are ways to encourage the economy described by 1 to turn into the equilibrium described by 2 using gentle nudges, employee ownership, and public
                stock, and progressive taxation and minimum wage laws. Without these nudges, you will fall away from equilibrium permanently.
            </p>
            <p>All Keynsian policy is based on this analysis, which you really can only find in Marx.</p>

                YOU DON’T CUT ANYTHING! You have no understanding of economics. If you reduce all government, large corporations will create their own de-facto government, like your cable company creates its own monopoly and charges
                whatever it wants for your internet, with whatever laws it can legislate to you through the fine print in its contracts. It’s the government’s job to guarantee a competitive economy where business is nimble and individuals
                can innovate.
            </p>
            <p>
                An economy cannot tolerate unemployment. If there is unemployment, you need to absorb it into jobs. Always, without fail. If you can’t raise taxes, you need to print the money! There is no excuse for unemployment, you need
                to make sure that every person who needs a job has a job, period. Whether it’s a government job or a private sector job.
            </p>
            <p>
                There can be no unemployment in an economy, it destroys wages for everyone, it is the reason that economies can be depressed. There is also no moral excuse to leave a person’s labor unused while they are looking for a better
                job. There is always something useful a person can do, build a bridge, write code, whatever. If the private sector doesn’t have use for people, the government must find a use for them, otherwise the wages of everyone will
                fall due to competition with the unemployed.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no unemployment in economic equilibrium, it doesn’t exist in the model you use to justify capitalism. When you see it, you must get rid of it. Subsidizing college is a full employment prescription, both because
                students are out of the labor pool, and because they come out with better qualifications to fill openings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without full employment, there is nothing else that works. The welfare policies of Europe are actually a gimmick to avoid having the government find jobs for people— it’s just easier to write a check, and it’s substantially
                the same in macro impact. But it kills a person to not be productive, it destroys motivation and makes people useless, and drives them to drugs and suicide. Sanders is proposing the proper policy— jobs for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s not a handout, it’s absolutely required. The rest of his policies require taxing non-competitive income, and instituting single-payer healthcare so that businesses don’t have to deal with it anymore, and costs are
                finally contained for real, as they are everywhere else in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is impossible to argue with a conservative, you don’t understand the fundamental problem of capitalist economies. The fundamental problem is unemployment, as Marx identified, which prevents economic equilibrium from ever
                being attained. Any full employment policy fixes this, although it is always easier for governments to give handouts than to advocate for jobs, because governments find it easier to hand out money than contract for useful
                work.

                this is why the entire world makes a floor of care which is government provided. I don’t agree with the British system, where the floor is also the ceiling, because there is no reason to prevent markets on top of the basic
                care provided by the government. Markets fix whatever rationing issue you have with the basic care. But it doesn’t matter, even the British system is better than the US by a mile.

            <p>I would prefer to have a progressive corporate tax, which is much higher for larger corporations. That produces an incentive for firms to split themselves up, without onerous regulation.</p>
            <p>Regarding subsidies for green firms, you can do that outside the tax code, with direct purchases.</p>
            <p>
                I also would like to see no corporate tax on worker cooperatives, perhaps a negative tax for those. This way, a person who starts a company and distributes equity to employees gets a better tax rate, to reflect the better
                working environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point of the tax code is to penalize anti-competitive behavior. With the corrupt government we have, it is the exact opposite, and you get tax breaks and tax shelters for the largest corporations, and punitive taxes on
                the smallest. It’s a miracle you have any small business left in the US really.

            <p>What YOU call “inflation” is purely monetary, and meaningless. What EVERYONE ELSE calls inflation is the change in the price of a basket of goods which set the CPI. That’s what I mean when I say inflation.</p>
            <p>
                The minimum wage which minimizes unemployment is not zero, and this ridiculous prediction you just made is shown to be false every time minimum wage goes up and unemployment simultaneously goes down. It’s a counterintuitive
                effect, due to the stimulus effect of extra spending.
            </p>
            <p>
                The limit at which rising minimum wage produces CPI changes (inflation) is when production is stressed. That happens when everything is working at peak capacity, and that’s when everyone is working and unemployment is zero.
                It is zero, that is, if there is enough infrastructure to employ everyone. If not, you need more investment in new industry, and until that time, you need a jobs program to get unemployment to zero.

                When you do Keynsianism right, it increases personal liberty too, as you do not put money into enormous corporations making bombers and carriers, but into small businesses doing construction or programming, or into workers

                Marx wasn’t proposing slavery, that was Lenin. Marx pointed out that a capitalist economy has a problem with wages dropping and demand not sufficient to purchase all the products. His solution was to let business concentrate
                into monopolies, as they naturally do, then take the monopolies over by the state. That’s not a good idea, but the problem he identified is real.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lenin wasn’t exactly proposing slavery either, he just proposed to run an entire country as if it were a single corporation. The idea was to build the monopolies from scratch, instead of taking it over. That is exactly what
                the USSR did.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s a tremendous mistake, as enormous corporations are not efficient compared to small business, but it is effectively what the US chooses to do in most industries also. The USSR was competitive with the US precisely in
                those industries where the US is dominated by large firms. It was hopelessly behind in those industries where the US was dominated by small business.

                I guess the million anti-nuke protesters in NYC were delusional, and the millions of European protesters trying to get intermediate range ICBMs out of Western Europe. And the folks who made “Threads”, “The Sacrifice”,
                “Special Bulletin”, “The Day After”, “Testament”, “War Games”, and “Miracle Mile” were all delusional, since nobody cared about the topic of those films.

            <p>Google “films about nuclear war” and you’ll find that they cluster around two periods: 1964 (near the Cuban Missile Crisis) and in 1984 (near the Reagan is so stupid crisis).</p>
            <p>
                I can guarantee you ONE person was definitely delusional. That’s Yuri Andropov. He was completely positive the US was going to launch a nuclear first strike in 1983, and his network of spies had to calm him down that there
                was no preparation for this sort of thing. But there was still a provocative simulation of a launch in 1983, and a Soviet satellite glitch that looked like a launch. The cold war was extremely serious in 1983, because the
                intermediate range missiles made the required response time shorter than 10 minutes, so you had hair-trigger launch sequences.

                No, the Pershing II missile system, with 7 minutes to Moscow was to blame. Reagan mouthing off about “evil empires” was to blame. George Bush mouthing off about surviving limited nuclear war was to blame. The Korean Air
                shootdown, whatever that was, was to blame. The Soviets believed there would be a nuclear first strike in 1983, and they had glitches that could have led to war. Every 10 year old child was panicking about nuclear war,
                especially accidental war, but curiously enough, none of the adults (around me at least). The adults were wrong. The kids were right. I stopped listening to old people in 1985.

            <p>If you want extra health care, pay for supplemental insurance. In France, people get supplemental insurance, they pay 30% less in total, and they get more health care.</p>
            <p>
                Health care is expensive in the US because there is no government to hold down costs for MRIs, prescription drugs, x-rays, and so on, and hospitals and medical professionals make a higher pay than is justified by market rate
                given the number of doctors, through guild practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the government holds down basic care costs, that sets the pay scale for the private system on top. If you feel you aren’t getting enough care, buy supplemental insurance. Your rates won’t be driven up by homeless people
                and uninsured going to emergency rooms, and by ridiculous unnecessary tests for children and ignorant people who can’t evaluate their care independently.

                It’s a question of structural bias, I’ll let readers review the Politifact analysis. Bernie Sanders is so clean that he gets “false” for things like “ran an ad that quoted a newspaper correctly, but didn’t mention that the
                newspaper didn’t endorse him”. He gets “mostly false” for saying “black youth unemployment is at 51%”, because the statistics are including those giving up, underemployment, and are a few years old. These things are such
                slight errors that it is impossible not to laugh. I don’t dispute Politifact’s analysis, it is usually correct on details. I dispute it’s objectivity. I actually wish Sanders would lie more, so he could win more easily. But
                no dice, he is more ethical than I am.

                shooting, Ruby Ridge, IRS audits of right wing groups?”, “Do you believe that space aliens visited the US at any time?“(!!) “Are you going to release JFK files?” on every issue, it’s the same pander pander lie as the

            <p>Minimum wage is Keynesian. You don’t understand Keynesianism, it’s not “what Keynes said”, it’s “how to fix what Marx said in a Capitalist economy”. You can’t understand Keynesian policies without reading Marx.</p>
            <p>
                One of the problems in an economy is that competition with the unemployed pushes wages to subsistence. A mimimum wage offsets that and produces wages as if there were no unemployment. It is better to reduce unemployment to
                zero, but in the absence of that, a minimum wage is as good as any policy that gets you closer to equilibrium. Minimum wage was passed under FDR, at the beginning of the Keynesian era.
            </p>
            <p>
                As minimum wage is raised, you increase consumption and decrease unemployment, until you get as close to zero as you can without investment. Then inflation begins. To actually get to zero unemployment, you need a jobs
                program to absorb excess labor too.

                Government run health care is 30-50% cheaper than what you have in the US, and produces better outcomes. Sanders isn’t proposing a VAT because he does it with a properly progressive mix of payroll and income taxes. It’s not
                magic, his plan is dead on accurate on the numbers (despite what you read), which is a first for campaigns.

                Food consumption does not usually involve coercion or emergency, in cases of famine, when it does, the government gets involved. “Government food” existed in the US in the 1940s and 1950s. Food is not a problem usually,
                because the consumer knows how to buy it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main problem with health care is that the consumer usually doesn’t know enough to make an informed choice, the doctor both opaquely diagnoses the care required and gets paid for the amount of care dispensed, and the
                insurance company foots the bill. This allows hospitals to make profits by over-treating and over-prescribing. Government systems set a ceiling and strong policies for care, and then private add-ons complete the care in a
                market system, so that there is no rationing.

                out the contents for myself through later writings. That’s largely a collection of 19th century wage-labor statistics in England showing that without zero unemployment, industrial wages collapse to subsistence, together with
                implications of this observation. This is the basis for Marx predicting the collapse of capitalism (essentially the great depression) and Keynes proposing a fix by zeroing unemployment.

                Carter was one of the two or so reasonable postwar presidents, Eisenhower being the other one. Reagan took credit for Carter accomplishments in reducing inflation, deregulating airlines, and breaking up AT&amp;T. Reagan
                added nothing but nonsense economics, but enjoyed the inflation free economy he inherited, and created a boom-bust cycle which led to a market crash and recession in 1987 and to a deep recession in 1991.

            <p>
                Carter’s malaise is the austerity Volker imposed to end inflation.There is nothing you can do about it. The reason you associate Carter with misery is that Democrats are only elected when Republicans screw things up so badly
                that the ruling class can’t bear the economic conditions anymore. We are now witnessing the end of that cycle, as the ruling class loses its grip on elections, with Sanders.

                I know Republican tactics, I saw the Dukakis ad when it was running. Those tactics only work on TV, and the fraction of Americans reliant on TV is shrinking. Sanders is creating a “false narrow avenue of attack” with
                Socialism— he is presenting the Republicans with what looks to them as a gift, a direct passage to the heart of the city. But because he is not an advocate of state control of the economy, it’s an attack that makes no sense,
                that path is the easiest to guard, and it is narrow enough that each of the attacks can be deflected in turn. That’s how Sanders could win all his previous elections in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>Clinton’s attack machine is as dirty as the Republicans’, but she fails against Sanders for a reason. Such attack machines are only useful in monopolized media of sound-bites, and can be circumnavigated online.</p>
            <p>
                Sanders is also very good at TV, and can counter the attacks extremely simply. “I have never advocated state control of industry” suffices to refute the socialism attack. At best, it turns into a referendum on American
                foreign policy in Nicaragua in the 80s, a foreign policy Americans would recognize today as odious.

                There needs to be a government monopoly because the consumer in this case doesn’t have the information required for an informed choice, and the consumer is out to save his or her life, and is going to pay whatever the doctor
                says, in whichever hospital is closest. It’s an extortionist situation. In cases where the consumers can make an informed choice, like optional surgery or plastic surgery, these are the cases covered by supplemental
                insurance, everything works well under markets, and no change is necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                In health, the patient can be easily scammed and overcharged, and the government is the only entity strong enough to rein in costs of lifesaving care. The role of supplemental insurance is to pay for those things the
                consumer wants but the government decided it won’t pay for.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason the US system is so expensive is that hospitals and doctors systematically overcharge the insurance companies, who are too weak to be able to control costs. That’s just what happens. With supplemental insurance,
                they can’t be said to be killing their customers, so they can negotiate appropriately. The government needs to be the negotiator for lifesaving care.

        <div>
            <p>
                The difference is the negotiating power of the buyer in regard to health care and food. The person getting health care is not usually in a position to know what kind of care they should be receiving, and they can be
                manipulated into spending whatever the doctor wants them to spend, by just inventing tests and diseases. The consumers simply don’t have enough information. When they do, as in the case of optional surgery, the market works
                fine.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s what makes health care different, and it is why the parts of care that are most frightening and most difficult to control, the parts that involve lifesaving measures, are paid for by all modern developed states. The
                remaining health care is done by supplemental insurance and markets, and that system works fine.

                company, it has become a corporate dead weight preventing competition.

                Bernie Sanders’ proposals are successful everywhere they are used, and his economic policy is pro small-business and pro competition. You need to learn how innovation happens, and how economies work. They don’t work when
                there is no competition, and a small number of people at the top of a small number of corporations stuff money into their pockets. That’s not American, it’s Soviet, and this is the cause of failure of every economy that went
                down that road.

                A good campaign finance system can allow citizens to finance campaigns directly without paying the bill on the first $100, or paying a small and smoothly growing percentage. This requires Congress to vote, but I doubt it
                would be hard to pass something that increases their funding from constituents. The point is that it isn’t centralized, the citizens decide which candidates to support, not the government.

                The goal with media is decentralization and loss of monopoly, which means separating infrastructure from service. The example is airline deregulation and AT&amp;T breakup and telecom deregulation. The infrastructure of
                television is separate from the service of programming, and nowadays, when the cable lines are digital, the whole thing is restructuring, except the large media oligarchy is standing in the way.

                You need good pro-competitive measures, and good anti-trust enforcement, and that requires good judgement in both the executive and Congress. Sanders hasn’t proposed anything beyond the $100 tax rebate for donations, but it
                gives an indication of the decentralized and citizen oriented approach he takes, not a big-government top-down approach.

                McGovern was the guy who turned the US nutrition program into the food-pyramid, he was the poster-child for nanny-liberalism. He was running against Nixon, a strong Keynsian, and his supporters advocated ingesting

                Sanders is a rock-ribbed supporter of liberty, and his programs support small business, jobs, and economic growth. He is to the libertarian side of Clinton on surveillance, guns, police state, habeus corpus, and all the
                other issues that I can’t imagine could possibly be controversial, but they are. He is the only real Keynesian in the election, and he is the only honest person running in decades. He is a shoo in, not a long shot.

                The president of the US appoints the prosecutor, and there could have been a trial immediately regarding the torture policy, which blatently and unambiguously violates 7 decades of clear American law and precedent, including
                specific judgements against waterboarding, and where all parties admitted their actions. That comes with a prison sentence, so it starts to produce political pressure. A torture trial produces political will to look into
                9/11 malfeasance, and depending on the results of an investigation, it can lead to a trial for treason. Once you have the trial for treason, you get more testimony, as people feel free to speak, and then you can start the
                trial for murder. We are a country of laws, and those laws were broken.

            <p>
                The country is not at all polarized on raising minimum wage, that’s at 90%, and it is majority with Republicans and Democrats. It is not polarized on subsidized college, nor is it polarized on infrastructure spending, or on
                tax increases for the wealthy. It is not polarized on breaking up banks, or on support for small business. There are no states where these proposals don’t have majority support. That means, red or blue, you can always find a
                majority to vote out a candidate on a specific issue either in the primary or in the general.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further, voter turnout among Republicans is only at 50%, and among Democrats, say 40% in Congressional races. A 25% increase in turnout in opposition beats any Republican, and for that you just need organizing and money.
                This is why congress is terrified of organized opposition, and it’s the reason money is so important in Congressional races, and it’s the reason Congress is so easy to buy out by donors.
            </p>
            <p>
                The same factors that allow Congress to get manipulated by special interests is the factor that allows Bernie Sanders to influence Congress. A powerful organization can get results in Congress much more easily than you
                think. It only takes a march, and a defeat or two, and then it’s a sea change. That’s how Republicans pushed through their policies when they were against the best judgement of most Democrats and Democrats controlled
                Congress.

                Bernie Sanders has an economic policy which is designed to reduce unemployment, until it is zero. His main policies are an infrastructure jobs program, which gets Federal money directly into formerly unemployed workers’
                pockets, education subsidies, which reduce the pool of workers and helps retrain workers for openings, a higher minimum wage which reduces unemployment by increasing demand, and public health care, which allows small
                businesses to compete, and increases worker mobility, as workers no longer have to worry about health benefits.
            </p>
            <p>These policies, if done right, can reduce unemployment to zero, and produce tremendous economic growth, as in the late 90s. But you need to understand economics, not listen to Republican propaganda.</p>

                Hitler had the best capitalist economy in the 1930s, which is why Germany was able to destroy so much of the world in the war. Nobody disputes that, it’s not praise of Hitler. It’s praise of Keynesianism. I am obviously not
                a Hitler supporter, but he was just a Keynesian, and Hitler’s economic policies, road construction and military spending, were adopted more or less as is, by Eisenhower.

                They are “more productive”, only in the sense that they are paid so little that the corporation can suck out more profit. Mon and pop stores are more efficient in every real measure except centralized profits, because they
                don’t need WalMart’s bureaucratic overhead, and they are more responsive.
            </p>
            <p>
                To get rid of WalMart’s advantage, you need fair pricing laws, so that WalMart can’t get special deals. You need to enforce anti-dumping laws, so that they can’t operate at a loss to drive competitors out of business. You
                need zoning reform at the local level to prevent them getting subsidized land deals, and you need a high minimum wage, to cut into their margin. With these reforms, they would quickly go out of business, as they are terribly
                inefficient compared to small stores.

                Congress to pass it. If they resist such a popular measure, the leaders of the opposition need to be voted out.

                Living wage = “the maximum minimum wage you can set before inflation starts”. That’s also the minimum wage level which minimizes unemployment. It would probably be around $25 an hour considering the productivity gap between
                workers today and 1979.

                WW2 is Keynesianism on steroids, and Keynesianism in the US never was implemented properly until WW2, when the top tax rate jumped to 94%, and government spending eliminated unemployment altogether. In England, and even in

            <p>The main point of Keynesianism (you can’t read Keynes, you need to read Marx) is to elminate unemployment. The US programs were never sufficient to eliminate unemployment until the war, when they did so and then some.</p>

                Those are right wing talking points. No real economist takes this seriously. What you call “malaise” is Carter’s austerity program, which was designed to end inflation, and it did. Inflation and unemployment can coexist when
                there is no capital to invest in new business, because it has inflated away. This is why you stop stimulating when inflation starts, as Carter responsibly did. That’s what you call “misery index”. The association with
                depression is unfortunate, as the only real depression is due to Bush’s Reaganomics.

                Keynes doesn’t have anything original to say, he is cribbing Marx, and getting details wrong. His proposals are watered down nonsense, and there is no point in reading Keynes, all a Marx reader has to do is say “Ok, lets say
                we wanted to fix Marx’s problem under Capitalism. What do we do?” The answer is to equalize incomes by paying people to drive unemployment to zero. Everyone can see that.

            <p>
                Keynes couldn’t mention Marx, or else he would have been an academic pariah. So he made up a bunch of stupid nonsense to get the basic idea across without mentioning the income segregation and competition with the
                unemployed. His proposals are basically more or less sound, to the extent that they agree with what a random person would say would reduce unemployment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deficit spending to grow the economy is a process of redistribution, as the inflation takes money away from people who get paid too much, and the jobs program distributes it to unemployed, who got paid nothing before. There
                is no point to reading Keynes, he had nothing original to say beyond getting what Marx said discussed in non-Marxist economic journals, in obfuscatory language.

                He doesn’t just need to turn out voters for him, they will turn out in ok numbers in the election. More importantly, he needs an organized opposition for intrasigent Republicans and a fundraising organization with a goal.
                The goal is aiming that operation on vote-turnout during midterms to target specific individual congressmen, when it is easy, because turnout is already low. He already has that commitment from me and from a million other

            <p>I would prefer a president who would force them to pay a living wage, and supported small business until they broke that monstrosity up into smithereens. That’s Sanders.</p>

                The argument against the type of inequality seen in the US is very simple— in economic equilibrium, the kind you read about in economic textbooks, there is no significant inequality, beyond a small factor related to
                productivity, because if someone is doing something and making more money, a competitor goes and does that, until the incomes equalize. That’s Adam Smith’s argument for the stabilization of incomes at around the mean, and
                the economic model used until the mid 19th century to justify capitalism on egalitarian grounds, as counterintuitive as that sounds today, with hundreds of years of experience with the inequality produced by Capitalism.
            </p>
            <p>
                That prediction is correct in market equilibrium, it predicts a strict correlation between income and productivity, with very little inequality, entirely tied to producitivity differences, and no worker being paid that much
                more than another, since there is a physical limit on the number of hours a person can work. While it is largely false in the real world, it is actually roughly true in the professions, and in small business.
            </p>
            <p>
                It fails in the real world due to ownership of capital, and the existence of social classes with unequal access to capital. This produces skewed income, income not tied to productivity, unemployment, and
                recession/depression, as the workers competing with the unemployed can’t demand the wage justified by productivity. That is the point of redistributive taxation.
            </p>

                . The basic point is that economies which have inequality simply collapse in the same way the US is collapsing now, into an underproducing empoverished underclass making a majority, and small capital-owning parasitic class
                that is useless. The US avoided this in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s by strong tax policies. But Reagan stopped doing that, and here we are.

                The health care industry is about 20% of the economy, and even with the best savings of national health care, it will still be greater than 10%. so you can’t have national health care without a larger percentage of
                government expenditures as a percentage of GDP. Health care is by far the single issue differentiating the tax/spend structure of the US government from that of other countries, and it is what makes this statistic
                meaningless. The cost of health-care is born by the public, whether it is a government program providing basic care, or private insurance companies.

                He probably will allow independent groups affiliated with the Democrats to run ads helping his campaign, but have no superpac directly affiliated with his capaign. That’s a terrible compromise, but that’s my best guess. I
                expect he will do something sensible when nominated, and his ideas have uniformly been better than my guesses at what they would be, so I just trust his judgement.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point is more of a matter of declaring principles. He really can’t stop me from making a pro-Bernie superpac and collecting money, and running ads, but he won’t approve the process, or even indirectly coordinate with me,
                or even wink at me while I do it. It would be a truly independent effort.

                I didn’t know about Humphrey, thanks, I’ll read about it. I think that one plank about worker cooperatives, however meager and isolated it appears, completely justifies Sanders’ self-adopted title. It is not an imposition,
                or a top-down program, but a genuine call for greater distribution of ownership by the public, and an assurance that the government won’t get in the way, and won’t help big business get in the way. This is strongest possible
                support of small business possible.

                Having internet access is not the same as getting all your information from your computer, and none from your TV. That describes every voter under age 35 or so, and many voters under age 45, and I think 100% of the
                enthusiastic Sanders supporters. Certainly it’s true for me. I found out that Sanders was running from an online comment, and started donating after a few months, when I read his platform and saw the level of online support.
                Online, he is crushing the other candidates by enormous margins. If you only watch TV, or read print newspapers, his rise would be an inexplicable mystery, like Obama’s in 2008. The only reason he isn’t a dead favorite now
                is that not all voters are getting their information from the internet exclusively.

                I agree about Sanders, he is a Keynesian, and therefore a Democrat. He calls himself a “Democratic Socialist” because of his support for social programs. But there is one article of genuine socialism in his platform,
                although it is a very modest proposal. He advocates some modest incentives for worker-owned business. That’s a kind of version of real socialism, although a very moderate, voluntary kind, and it is supported across parties
                by many people, who like worker-owner business, and private one-person business, or family owned business, which is much the same thing.

                Elections were won on soundbites when the dominant medium was television. They are not won on soundbites online, and the number of wired voters is at about 50%. The internet also back-influences TV, and sets the tone for
                what is acceptable in old media, much as TV set the tone for radio once upon a time.

                He will raise their taxes only if he gets a national health bill, it’s a contingent tax. He will do nothing to their taxes without a comprehensive health care reform, except for a pittance for family leave (which comes with
                family leave, and is also contingent). Soundbites don’t count for much, contingent tax-raises are not the same as tax hikes, and all his tax proposals are properly progressive.

                When the government can get the Fed to print $18 trillion, issue it, and then tax it, at the cost of some inflation, the national debt should not be the overriding concern. This is why nations set their own monetary policy.
                The overriding concern is making sure that people are fairly paid, and that small business can emerge and compete in a horrific climate.

                Yeah ok, continue to think that. But Walmart decimated small business by “free people” contracting to supply them at reduced costs, because they were so big, they could leverage their size to bully them into non-competitive
                pricing. That didn’t come from the government. Chain stores do the same, and are decimating small business. None of that comes from government. The mean wage they pay is a starvation wage that no small-business owner can
                impose on himself or herself. That’s “free people”.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem is not the government, it is concentrations of power that allow large corporations to pay their employees too little and drive small competitors out of business. To get rid of these practices you need
                pro-competition policy, including breaking up monopolies, instituting pro-competition regulation (or “deregulation”, however you like to call it), like in the AT&amp;T breakup and telecom deregulation/regulation or the
                airline deregulation, both done by Carter/Clinton.

                The disputes within the left are the disputes about the society of the far future, and they have been more or less sorted out now. The Marxist Leninists lost in 1956, at least in the US and in Britain. You can read Doris
                Lessing’s account of that period in “The Golden Notebook”, which describes (among other things) the mass disillusionment of the left with communism after the Hungarian revolution was put down (and also the nascent Feminist
                movement, and personal spiritual things, it’s a great great book).

                George McGovern was the archetype of the nanny-state liberal. When they succeeded and faced loss of funding, he converted the anti-starvation nutrition programs into the “food groups” and “food pyramid” nonsense that
                contributed so much to the poor nutrition situation in the US. His supporters included zealous promoters of LSD use, and he supported amnesty for Vietnam era draft dodgers (something Carter did on one of his first days, and
                something I agree with, but it was catastrophically unpopular). Nixon ran against him as a strong Keynesian, so he had no distinct economic policy to run on, and the racist electorate was split on civil rights, which made
                his running on negative income taxes a poor sell.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sanders does not support nanny-state measures, he doesn’t support a negative income tax beyond the EITC, he supports jobs. He is a strong Keynesian running against a party that has rejected Keynesianism on ideological
                grounds for 40 years. He doesn’t support the use of any brain-damaging chemicals (although he supports decriminalization of marijuana on the grounds that people should not be saddled with criminal records for such a thing),
                and he is a committed trust buster and an honest politician.
            </p>
            <p>
                He is not so far left as you think, as many of his positions, on guns, on abortion, on government surveillance and privacy, on the division of business into managable chunks, these are all libertarian positions. Many
                Republicans can find a lot of common ground with him, which is why his support is sky-high in Vermont, and his polling is so good in New Hampshire, which is a swing state.

                What Sanders is proposing is VASTLY superior to what Clinton is proposing, if only for the simple reason that it will get enacted when Sanders is elected. Simply breaking up the big banks is supported not only by 170
                economists, but implicitly by Wall St. traders who value the banks higher when split. There is no comparison between Sanders’ meaty proposals and Clinton’s lightweight second-in-line wannabe ripoff quarter-way measures.

                Clinton is riskier on that front, because she is so disliked. And unfortunately the dislike is actually justified. I mean, “travelgate” alone would be a disqualifier if the Republicans weren’t crazy, or the Iraq vote, or the
                Benghazi video nonsense, or the 90s PATCON, or the ridiculous covert intervention in Ukraine, or Honduras, or the mess in Libya, or any of the other Republican talking points. There are also other things, like the dubious
                Oklahoma City bombing, which looks like a less horrible Democrat led prototype 9/11. The only reason voters put up with Clinton is because the Republicans were worse, and the Clintons could navigate the dirty waters to a
                half-way sensible policy in the 90s, But the world is different now, and being clean counts for much more, because the internet is a tool that exposes corruption so easily.

                The point of anarchism is to reduce concentrations of power. This can be done by progressive policies, until it is structural, and doesn’t need government to enforce it anymore. You don’t need a government preventing you
                from buying human flesh, nobody wants it, and you shouldn’t really need a government to prevent economic exploitation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The American version of anarchism is a strange perversion, where corporate concentration of power somehow becomes just fine. This is not anarchism, it is a way of corporatists to sell their ideology to masses with a warped
                half understanding of leftist ideas. It only worked in the US before the public could educate itself, but now you can use google to understand anarchism with very little effort.

                Your dislike bordering on hate is shared by nearly all Republicans and a vast majority of independents. This is a large part of why Sanders is the more pragmatic choice. He will win more votes, and that’s what counts most of

                National Health Care isn’t just Europe. It’s the entire world, including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Canada, India, China, Cuba, literally the whole world. There are as many systems as there are countries, and even the
                worst ones work much better than the US.

            <p>I meant businesses which have nothing to do with health care, and which are required to provide health-care for their employees in a messy way. It’s a huge headache for businessowners right now.</p>
            <p>
                The government negotiates on basic care— the things that keep you alive. This sets a standard for payment. Then supplemental insurance provides optional care and add-ons, and ensures that there is no rationing, but you have
                to pay for it. That’s the French model.
            </p>
            <p>
                The private citizens pay the insurance companies for optional care and bells and whistles, while the government sets the base with tough negotiations on the required care, which they can do, being the largest provider. It’s
                a good way to keep costs low, and to allow a market. This is why the French system is better than the British. It doesn’t deny markets, it just gets rid of a system that doesn’t work.

                I’m not talking about the US alone. In England, home spending was their “new deal”, and it was implemented by Chamberlain. In Germany, it was Autobahn and military spending (this was copied by the US in the 1950s), and that
                was mostly under Hitler. Whichever politician was first with Keynsianism in their respective country won tremendous power, for good or for ill. Every country has Keynsian spending, it is required for an economy to function.
                If you have too little taxes, the inequality can balloon to catastrophic proportions, and you end up like Argentina.

                Government spending can solve the problem of an economy not working at 100% capacity, or with significant unemployment. This is the fundamental Keynesian principle which has been denied by the Republican party for 40 years,
                to their own demise. It’s true, and it has been recognized as a fact since the 1930s, when every industrialized economy on Earth implemented Keynesian spending and never stopped.

                It’s not profit, but redundant administrative costs, which are largely invested in trying to negotiate with hospitals after they over-prescribe and over-treat, and charge outrageous fees, while trying to invisibly increase
                deductibles and copays on sick people. All this administrative effort is removed in single-payer.

            <p>
                The private insurance market for supplemental insurance would function just fine, as it does in France. But you need basic services decoupled from this, so that businesses are free to concentrate on business, and not on
                health care. it’s a pro-competition policy, it’s one of the reasons American business is less competitive. This is why many Republicans support single payer also.

                How much of that is federal taxes? The point of progressive taxation is to boost economic growth by promoting widespread wealth and maximum economic efficiency, by reducing inequality. If the economy doubles uniformly, your
                income doubles, and even if your taxes go up 2% for health care, you are much better off. You can’t have sustained inequality and sustained growth, people have known this since the Keynesian revolution of the 1930s.

                Hillary Clinton knew she was running in 2016 already in 2008. It is her responsbility to avoid impropriety. She will be in politics until she loses the 2016 primary, and after that she can talk to whoever she wants and take
                whatever fees she wants. But I guarantee you that once there is no chance of her being president, there will be no fees and no speeches.

                The point is that Polyakov has unique insight, he is not repeating platitudes or an amalgam of expert opinion. Yet his annual fees are significantly lower than Clinton’s hourly fees. That means the money is coming not

                effective as possible. Since this is not true of other candidates, who are not financed by small internet contributions, I’ll let you draw your own conclusions about their internet support.

                The problem with Hillary Clinton is that the independents and Republicans are not making up the bad behavior in her past, or the corruption. It is there, it is real, and it is bad. Does that mean I won’t vote for her in the
                general? No. I’ll have to vote for her to avoid something worse. But Republicans and independents won’t do it, and they will do so for Sanders in greater numbers.

                They can support the candidate directly within limits, and place truly indepedent speech anywhere, online or on TV, or contribute to truly independent organizations. I think the real issue is the monopolized mass-media, it
                monopolized in the era of radio and TV, and it is more consolidated than ever, except for the internet. There is no reason why each TV station’s hour or radio hour is not independently owned and rented by a different
                organization. When the mass media is broken up into teeny tiny smithereens, the cost of ads will be low enough to allow private citizens to advertize their views in radio media, much as they can do so online. A serious issue
                is monopoly power leading to only wealthy voices getting heard.

            <p>
                But you asked for a solution today and right now. I will follow Sanders, and propose that a good public financing model is to refund the first $100 in political contributions by each citizen as a tax rebate. This is a form
                of decentralized public financing which involves very little government regulation, and the amount of money will easily swamp special interest donation, as it amounts to $20 billion annually. It can be passed by Congress
                today, as it will increase political contribution to all sides.

                Because there are still Democrats who are not bought, Sanders and Warren being the prominent two. The Democratic corruption doesn’t infect their ideology in a fundamental way as it does Republicans. It is also a fact that a
                party whose leaders presided over the murder of 3000 Americans, engaged in systematic corruption in favor of corporate cronies and wealthy donors, led atrocious foreign wars on trumped up excuses, and systematically
                destroyed the constitution to the point that Habeus Corpus and the Fourth Amendment became optional in their minds, must simply never win a national election ever again. That is, as soon as voters understand what was going
                on, and that’s already either approaching or past 50% of voters.
            </p>
            <p>The problem with the Democrats is mostly localized to Clinton and close associates. There are many relatively clean Democrats, and with pressure, there will be more.</p>
            <p>A nominee is also party leader, and has more leeway as party leader than as president. Clean candidates is a priority for Sanders, and having a clean party will finally win over independents.</p>

                Sanders is not a tame choice for leader of the Democratic party. He will clean the party up, and that’s a good thing. The Republicans suffer from unfixable corruption, but the Democrats can still be saved. It is not
                appreciated by the author the degree to which the public has lost faith in the honesty of their government, and a traditional choice for the Democratic leadership will not do better than Obama, and Clinton will do
                significantly worse.

                Health care is expensive, and nearly all the taxes Sanders has proposed go to funding this. The resulting tax structure is similar to the Reagan era taxes between 1980 and 1985, before the second round of Reagan tax cuts.
                The progressive structure has been largely lost, and is responsible for the income inequality and loss of worker purchasing power seen today.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no benefit to lowering taxes on high incomes, the benefits only come from lowering costs and taxes on lower incomes. The Sanders health plan is progressive enough that most middle-class and even moderately wealthy
                families will save money on health care, and the tax will reduce income only at the very top.
            </p>

                You are the one who should go back to school. The military funding in the US is extremely malleable, and is used for research regularly. A huge amount can be moved around to civilian spin-offs with no problem by a competent
                president, and military grants are a significant proportion of many academic projects, and industrial development.

                against the war. His votes and activities are as courageous as possible, consistent with being a sitting senator. It’s the best you can expect, and even a little more, as he was risking his career. Other courageous folks who

                in its interests.

                But the “foreign policy” expected of candidates is repeating the “wisdom” of the establishment generals who feed the same lines of tripe to all the candidates, so you can select the candidate with the best taste in tripe.
                Clinton’s absurd nonsense about a “no fly zone” is the stupidest policy proposal in recent memory, and alone should disqualify her for president. It’s a policy against Russia, not against ISIS. It helps Turkey, and it helps
                ISIS indirectly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result of this pandering is that the worst possible foreign policy is bandied out at election time, and bears no relation to the real foreign policy enacted by the candidates. Cruz is not going to “carpet bomb” Syria, he
                just says that. Trump is not going make Mexico pay to build a wall, he just says that. And Clinton is not going to “get tough with Putin”, because she needs Russian help with ISIS.
            </p>
            <p>
                All this nonsense is a dangerous game of proving who you know and what sentences you can drop to fool the gullible public. Sanders has never pandered, he tells the truth regarding good relations with Iran, and good
                cooperation to remove ISIS funding from Saudi Arabia. He is right about the Muslim nature of the fight, and he is middle of the road on foreign policy, necessarily so, as any strong position he would take would get

                It is impossible to judge foreign policy well from a campaign. Nixon campaigned on “Peace”, and brought you escalation and the bombing of Cambodia. Reagan campaigned on “tough on Russia” and nearly brought you accidental
                nuclear war. This stuff is dangerous pandering, and there is no use in it. You need to know the candidate’s general principles, and what judgement they bring to the issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                What Sanders said on foreign policy is more than enough to show sound judgement, and I trust him more than anyone else to protect the country from its real threats, and not invent or produce new ones where they don’t
                currently exist.

                Independents already know where Bernie Sanders stands with regard to their interests. He has never advocated state takeover of the economy, and has not supported the Marxist-Leninist Soviet state at any time. It’s an absurd
                accusation that cannot stick, because he has a long record.

                I don’t justify it, I think it was terrible. But the regime was being changed the other way, from outside, at the same time. That was equally terrible, and if not for the first intervention, the second intervention would
                probably have never come. This zero-sum tit-for-tat spy-vs-spy nonsense has to end, it’s completely destructive of the international cooperation necessary for the problems we face today, most prominently, global warming.

                Every strong stance costs you support as a candidate, there is a firm limit to how much specific policy you can dish out and still get elected, just on statistical grounds. He has used up all of his political capital on his

                Bernie Sanders is nothing like McGovern. McGovern was the father of nanny-liberalism. He supported converting nutrition programs to help starving people into nonsense like the “food pyramid” and “food groups”, instead of
                just ending the programs. His supporters encouraged the use of brain-damaging chemicals like LSD, and the politics of the time was a culture war driven by racist opposition to civil rights. Nixon took all the bite out of the
                Democrats by supporting Keynesian economics more strongly than Democrats (he even screwed it up with price controls and over-stimulation). So McGovern had no economic platform to run on, and Watergate hadn’t broken yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                The world is different, we have an internet, and the internet is a tool for exposing corruption. Nixon would have a terrible time online, with pages exposing watergate. Anti-corruption candidates have a huge leg up in this
                media climate, corrupt candidates suffer due to the intense spotlight of new media, and so Sanders is ideal and Clinton is the opposite of ideal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sanders does not share any of McGovern’s weaknesses. He doesn’t support the type of ridiculous government meddling McGovern was into, he doesn’t advocate the use of any drugs (although he wants to decriminalize marijuana to
                avoid people having police records), he is squeaky clean, and he is running as a stimulus Keynesian at a time when the Republicans have abandoned Keynesianism for decades. That makes him a shoo in, not a long shot.

                Voting in the best interests of your constituents is the opposite of corruption. Sanders votes in their best interest, even when it is difficult, because he is a good representative. That’s why he gets good marks from his
                state.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, voting in the interest of donors, against the best interest of your constituents, that’s the definition of corruption. For example, Republicans who refuse Medicaid money because their Pharma and insurance
                lobby donors want to kill Obamacare. They’ll say it’s on principle, but its the principles themselves that are dictated by the donor class.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only viable way to vote against money for your state, for a politician, is if there is an even more powerful special interest than your state’s residents telling you it’s going to be ok, so that the political gain from
                their donations and advertising will offset the political loss from the loss of funding for the state.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clinton’s (second) vote on the bankruptcy bill is an example of this type of corruption (not the first vote, or the third no-show). Sanders’ vote on the deregulation of derivatives is an example of an honest vote that you
                may disagree with. I can accept disagreements, as difference of opinion are real. I can’t accept big money donors regulating the laws that are passed, or even implicitly setting the boundaries of the debate.
            </p>
            <p>The only time the boundaries of the debate have moved in modern memory is when a candidate who wasn’t financed by big-money was running. That person is Sanders, and the time to support him is today.</p>

                Money in politics is more insidious than a bribe. It has the effect of moving your positions subtly, because you think about the opinion of the money donors more often than you think about the opinion of those who do not
                donate. This is why candidates need to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. Clinton not only doesn’t avoid the appearance, she doesn’t avoid the impropriety.
            </p>
            <p>
                The influence of money in politics is especially obvious in the case of Sanders, who responds to mass public concerns vigorously, especially to his million or so volunteer and donor base, because they are his only source of
                funding.

                I am a proud BernieSis, and I will join with all my BernieSisters of getting rid of the Clinton poison in our party. Once the corruption is gone, the barrier to attracting independents, and even some (gasp) former
                Republicans is very low. I have had personal conversations with many Republicans who grudgingly admire Sanders, although they believe he is completely insane on economics. He isn’t. But they don’t know that yet. They will
                know once he is president. He has Vermont approval in the 80s for a reason.

                I swear to you that if you nominate an honest person, like Sanders, you have an opportunity to eliminate the Republican party forever. They have a doddering membership consisting of brainwashed and gullible folks, who will
                jump ship when the media climate is different. Donald Trump shows you that, there’s no substance there, but he can win a plurality of the party. There is no party as disgusting as the Republicans in any other comparable

                I am a proud BernieSis, and you should be a BernieSis too. It’s unfortunately not misinformation that the Republican spread. Clinton is as corrupt as the Republicans say, although nowhere as liberal as they claim. She’s only
                slightly better on corruption than the Republicans themselves, as her corruption is either for personal political gain, or to push policy that she genuinely believes in (that’s no excuse). In the 90s, there was no other
                option, so I went along with it, to avoid the Republican option of both corruption and terrible politics. Now it is time for a house cleaning. There’s a huge mess of repulsive Bush adminstration lies, precursors to them
                under Clinton, and some successors under Obama.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every Bush adminstration abomination has a (much less terrible) precursor under clinton. 9/11? Oklahoma City. Homeland security? Proposed by Clinton, for domestic rather than foreign terrorism. Citizen intimidation using
                government power? Also Clinton, in travelgate, and IRS audits, and PATCON. The Republicans took it to a whole new level, but the corruption started in the 90s, as much as I hate to admit it. Actually, the 80s were no picnic,
                with Iran Contra and Oliver North, and various covert activities in South America.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am sick and tired of corruption, and I can’t vote for a Republican if my life depended on it. So the only option is to win in the primary. There is no alternative, the US needs honest government, and it needed it 20 years

                When he’s president, he can redirect that money into an equivalent infrastructure program, or research. As a Senator, it’s a question of Keynesian stimulus to his state. There is nothing he can do about it at that level,
                except for urging other Senators to redirect this massive spending away from the military and toward civilian uses. In context, it is unfortunately is a sensible vote, although a difficult one, because the F35 is really a
                bad machine. He made the right call for his state, and the only call he can make in this corrupt political climate. If you want it to change, vote him president.

            </p>
            <p>
                Sanders position on foreign policy is not pandering, and if he is elected, he will usher in an era of peace and prosperity the likes of which you can’t imagine. American allies uniformly recognize him as a man who doesn’t
                bow to business pressure, and who does not support the covert coups and interventions that lead to such instability in the modern world.

                For example, in both Republican and Democratic debates, the moderators still talk about the “red line” Obama drew regarding Assad and chemical weapons, and why he didn’t go to war when the red-line was supposedly crossed,
                without mentioning that it was known within a week of the attack that the actual source of the chemical weapons was the rebels, not Assad. The rebels released chemical weapons with the intention of blaming it on Assad, so
                the US would get involved in the war.

            <p>
                There are only a handful of issues where the public is aware of what is going on, and the Iraq war is one of them. I don’t fault Sanders for being vague on foreign policy, he is an honest candidate, and nearly all foreign
                policy campaigning is pure pandering, saying what the public wants to hear in order to feel safe.

                she’ll vote by poll. There is no conviction, and no principles, not even to the constitution, or to the basic principles of public trust.

                The Sanders’ campaign tactics are just fine. The Clinton campaign is busy producing attacks out of sheer nonsense. All these “improper activities” are nothing compared to stranding millions of credit card holders without
                bankruptcy protection, regardless of the bells and whistles regarding child support and other irrelevant distractions. The intent of the bill was poisonous— it was a prop to hold up the most monopolized industry in the US—
                the credit industry. Their rates are usurious, their fees to stores are outrageous, the competition is nonexistent since the mid-90s, and ramming through a bankruptcy “reform” bill is absolutely unconscionable. That Clinton
                supported it, after first opposing, is the most damning criticism of her campaign. There is no sincerity there, it is all poll-tested opinion, and listening to the donors whenever the public lets you get away with it.

                Nobody considers him a hypocrit. He is a responsible politician. He didn’t support a coup in Honduras, he doesn’t do covert activities for political gain like PATCON, he never created trumped up ridiculous charges to fire
                people like “travelgate”. He doesn’t appoint cronies to high positions, he never pardoned friends and contributors, he doesn’t make corrupt deals for securing credit card profits (as this article demonstrates Clinton did),
                he doesn’t accept money from Wall St. The line of attack fails on Sanders, because he has always acted his conscience.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no comparison between the candidates. Clinton is a dirty candidate, while Sanders is clean. And it’s not a 60/40 thing, preponderance of influence, or any of that. Clinton is a 100% dirty machine politician, while
                Sanders is a 100% honest Senator. Perhaps in an earlier era, one had to settle for a corrupt Democrat. Not today.

                It’s naive for old media. It becomes possible with an internet. If you are old, you might be missing the transformation in communication technology that turns this from “naivete” to “vision”. The lack of awareness of the
                power of internet communications is the main cause of the age-gap in Sanders supporters. It doesn’t take long to learn about the methods of online organizing pioneered by Dean, honed by Obama, and expanded by Sanders, if you
                join the campaign with a small contribution, you will see the real 50-state breadth depth of this movement. New media is at the core of the Sanders political revolution, but Sanders himself was strong enough to win without
                an internet, at a time when the internet didn’t exist, and television was bought out by corporations. That’s unimaginable to me, but he did it.

                American conservatism is HALF of it, the “reduce the power of government” half. American liberalism is the other half, the “reduce the power of big business” half. It is hard to do both, because the counterweight to big
                business is usually big government, while the counterweight to big government is usually big business.

            <p>
                What you need is structural policies that allow smaller business to thrive, and decentralized ownership that protects the employees from exploitation. These policies are half and half, they are “liberatarian” and
                “socialist”. That’s anarchism, and it’s not the same as US conservatism or US liberalism, it’s originally a European philosophy.

                I followed the bills when they were going through Congress, because I was outraged (although at the time, I didn’t notice or care about Hillary Clinton’s position). There were a whole bunch of attempts to pass this
                legislation, and the difference between them is superficial nonsense, protecting this tiny constituency, or that tiny constituency.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main point of the bill was the problem not the little bells and whistles CNN talks about— the goal was to make it easier for credit card companies to go after your assets despite your bankruptcy, because they were
                unhappy that they had a nonzero rate of default, despite their sky-high monopolistic rates.

                I agree with you on this. But there is exactly one way in which Sanders can actually claim to be a “Democratic Socialist” rather than just a “Social Democrat”. He advocates some modest incentives for worker-cooperatives, and
                distributed ownership of corporations. That’s an actual, real, honest-to-goodness socialist proposal, but in a form that can be understood and supported by both Republicans and Democrats, and involves no real state coercion,
                or state takeover, so it isn’t something Republicans even usually recognize as coming from the socialist philosophy.
            </p>
            <p>
                But this is a minor point in his platform. Most of it is just “social democracy”, and nobody sane disputes most of those points. the arguments in the public space are not coherent because of the propaganda coming from the
                right.
            </p>

                These protections are nonsense— the main effects of the bill were substantially the same, and Clinton’s vote on the second version is completely inexcusable. There was nothing wrong with American bankruptcy law in 2000, or
                in 1990, or in 1980, the problem is that you have monopolized credit card companies that charge outrageous usurious rates from customers, outrageous fees from stores, and expect borrowers to never default, to protect their
                insane profits. They need to be broken up into smithereens, not out there bribing president Clinton.
            </p>
            <p>Sanders took major policy positions regarding credit card rates and usurious banking fees. You would be wise to review them, instead of defending Clinton’s indefensible corrupt behavior.</p>
            <hr />
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                That’s total nonsense. The problem was that a bank took a bunch of risky loans, pretended that the chance that one person is going to default is entirely independent from the chance that another person is going to default
                (this is usually true), and then got a rating agency to certify this assumption with a tip-top AAA rating for the bundled loans.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the bank knew very well that defaults aren’t random. When property values go down, ALL the people default, because it makes no sense to pay back a mortgage that is worth more than the property itself. You won’t pay a
                $500,000 mortgage on a $300,000 house, you will just default, and repurchase at the lower price.
            </p>
            <p>
                So that means that the assumption was false, and the ratings agency should have known better. They were likely paid off by the bank that put together the loans, and now this created the analog of a “short sell” for the
                loans— you could get credit-default insurance from AIG. AIG went by the bogus estimates of risk from the ratings agency.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result is that there was an opportunity for profit. But to make money, you needed bundles of risky mortgages. So banks went on a wild spree of selling these mortgages, because suddenly they are in demand. Yes, they’re in
                demand because someone figured out how to use them for fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
                General oversight of derivatives is not really all that useful, not that I know what that oversight would be. The government is not all that great at judging these risks either, and the government could easily make similar
                mistakes in ratings.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is very difficult to regulate this nonsense from the top, you need to make sure that the ratings agency itself is checked by other independent private agencies which evaluate the same risk from the buyer’s point of view,
                not just the seller. That means you need independent reform of the rating agencies as Sanders has proposed, not a specific government oversight board (although, if done right, that can help too).
            </p>
            <p>
                None of this has to do with individual homeowners. Their responsibility is ZERO. They had nothing to do with the collapse. It’s all a function of ratings agency fraud, and banks internally buying and selling the bundles. The
                default rates of the homeowners didn’t even go up all that much during the collapse. They just went up by enough to make the credit default deals pay off, and then AIG was going to collapse, etc, etc.

                You post this comment a million times, on every post involving Sanders, and it’s not really correct. There are lots of different kinds of socialism, and the main difference between them is not democracy, but the power
                structure. I get that you support Sanders, I do too, but it’s not good to repeat disinformation. The type of stuff Sanders is talking about, and that you are trying to fold into “socialism” in general, is just “social
                democracy”, and it should not be controversial at all. It’s what people do all over the world to make a rational public system which provides infrastructure and basic services, so businesses don’t have to deal with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you are talking about real socialism, the kind where businesses are publically owned, the “people” can’t tell the government how to spend money, because “people” don’t have a coherent opinion. You need to poll, and ask,
                and only some people care to vote, and sometimes “people” don’t know anything at all about something. Ask “people” whether the NSF should fund research into “topological superconductors”. This means you need specialized
                bureaucracies, and they are often monopolized, and when that happens, if you have a good idea that the bureaucracy doesn’t recognize as legitimate, you are just screwed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main difference is whether the power is coming from above, or from below, and that means whether the state owns businesses, or whether people own businesses. This is the main distinction in socialist economics, and the
                same exact distinction exists in the US economy, between a large corporation, which is owned in a far away headquarters, and a local small business, which is owned by a person you know. Reducing corporate power is similar to
                reducing government power, since a large corporation has the power to effectively legislate policies and conditions to you, the consumer. This situation is intolerable— there’s a Newton’s third law of ideal politics.
                Whenever something affects you, you should be able to affect it back. When a business is a large monopoly, you are just as helpless as when the state tells you what to do.
            </p>

                Rahm was there from the beginning, he seemed like an honest guy from what I saw of him, which is extremely little. He was kicked out to Chicago when the party took over. Some of the apparatchiks I followed are Biden, who
                pushed the drone assassination program as a substitute for war so that you get more illegal horrific crimes under Democrats too. At least they were not as awful as the horrors under Bush. There was Kerry, who did all sorts
                of covert nonsense. To this day, you can’t say publically that the Syrian chemical attack came from the rebels, explicitly to draw the US into the war. Thanks John Kerry! He might not have been responsible for the attack

                stimulus, which wasn’t put in the hands of workers, the lack of jobs program, and the general destitution that was allowed to develop. The delay in the expiration of the Bush tax cuts was also inexcusable, even the inability
                to raise taxes to reasonable pre-1980 levels is not acceptable. The lack of anti-trust enforcement, the lack of regulation in the FDA (see Sanders attacking an Obama appointee for ridiculous claims about importing Canadian
                medications), etc, etc. It’s all a huge letdown, although Obama as a candidate was only slightly less progressive than Sanders.

                Regulation is best done as restructuring, so that you don’t need constant oversight, and in this case, only Sanders has real policy for restructuring that adresses the real problem, including reforming the ratings system and

                I accuse Republicans of worse offenses, 9/11, torture and rendition, creation of homeland security, massive NSA spying, criminal invasion and wars of aggression, journalist suppression, extrajudicial murder etc. But as much
                as I hate to admit it, all the Republican malfeasance were only extending Clinton ideas, just taken to the next even more monstrous level. The whole of this corruption has to end, and like, 10 years ago, not today, when it’s
                already too late. Even retroactive prosecutions of all involved officials would be a drain on the country, and perhaps a “truth and reconciliation commission” is the best one can hope for, to get the historical record
                straight, and prevent future crime.

                Priorities in a campaign are different than priorities in government, and one can be sure that the campaign he chose reflects his best considered analysis of those most urgent appeals which can motivate voters to produce a

                Racial issues are often divisive, not because they aren’t important, but because of splits in awareness in the electorate about the impact of racism. There is no question that justice requires pressure from below, like
                everything else, and I am grateful that BLM had the fortitude and organizational strength to apply that pressure. Of all the candidates, only Bernie Sanders listens and responds to pressure from below, and this is why he
                changed his platform so quickly. Other politicians listen to pressure from big money donors, and only give platitudes and superficial glib words, not meaningful policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t judge Sanders’ campaign by the standards of the saints and apostles, I judge him by the standards of politicians. He is responsive and compassionate, and moves on the issues quickly when he is lacking, just as he
                should. The response of Clinton to BLM was essentially empty— no hires, no policies, just words. The response of the other politicians has been worse than empty, it was negative, dismissing the concern.
            </p>
            <p>
                One must appreciate that Sanders is not a perfect candidate, no candidate is. He is a candidate who is striving to create transformative change, which is never easy, while listening to a diverse set of grievances from below.
                Appreciate the straightjacket he finds himself in, and the wiggle-room that he manages to find within this straightjacket, while still keeping the eyes on the prize.
            </p>
            <p>I am not saying that you should let up the pressure, but apply that pressure evenly, so that the greatest problems come to the least responsive, not the most.</p>

                He worked out his racial justice platform over the weeks preceding the second interruption, it took a long time to get this platform right, and I think it is a good summary of the public consensus on what measures can
                relieve the unbearable levels of police brutality in the black community. No politician can go far past public consensus, they can only influence it by persuasion, and choose sides, and he is doing his best to choose the
                right side, and push the boundary of what is acceptable in the right direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Racial justice is more controversial than anything else in his platform, although still not really controversial, and with the possible exception of universal single-payer health care, which is at 51% support in public
                opinion polls. I am 100% certain that he is on the right side of this issue, due to his history and his declared policies. This is in contrast to all other candidates. Remember that even Jimmy Carter ran with a worrisome
                implicitly segregationist platform when he was a southern politician, until he became president, and then he was a strong supporter of civil rights and appointed African Americans to high positions.

                What you mean is “I heard from some hearsay on the press that some people on the ground in Libya mentioned the video during the attack”. You heard wrong. The attack had nothing to do with the video, it was retribution for
                the US capturing some fighters, as leaked by Petraeus’s girlfriend. Clinton claimed the video to distract the public, and to push for internet censorship.

                Clinton, worse by a mile. I don’t want the least worst option, I’d rather vote for clean government, that’s why I voted for Obama. Except Obama has been as secretive as his predecessor, just with somewhat different

                The line for “serious inflation” is sharp, especially with minimum wage hikes— when you raise minimum wage from $50 to $60, and the economy is at full capacity, you will get 20% inflation right away. When you raise minimum
                wage from $8 to $15, nothing happens with inflation, because you aren’t at full capacity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The issue with systematic inflation is when you get indexed funds and indexed payouts, because this can lead to hyperinflation very easily even with a modest stimulus. The point of Carter’s austerity was to get rid of all
                the indexed pricing in the economy, to prevent spiralling inflation. The same sort of things needed to be done in a more draconian way in Israel under Shimon Peres in the 80s, when inflation was about 100% a month, due to
                overspending and borrowing for the 1973 war. This was similar to the US Vietnam spending.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your tax thinking is ridiculous— but it is roughly what is done today anyway, as capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than income. The reason to tax high incomes is because any high income is not an equilibrium
                phenomenon, it’s a phenomenon of class separation. Those people investing huge sums of money are not at all good at real innovation. I come from a science background, and the real innovation is stuff that no entrepreneur
                would ever invest in, as it is so uncertain and future-oriented, that it comes with no guarantee of profit. The investments that make money, even large amounts of money, are boring pedestrian second-in-line developments that
                are important, but don’t require any particular genius. A good professional investor can make those investments, as can a trained amateur with some money to place.
            </p>
            <p>
                These activities are best done by investment organizations, by people who make a professional salary making those investments. That salary doesn’t need to have any direct relation to the amount of money that they invest, any
                more than a banker making a $100,000,000 loan needs to get a $10,000,000 commission. The quality of your investments is rewarded by competitive bonuses and keeping your job, not by keeping the money. You have to separate in
                your mind “how much money I made for the company” from “how much money I should be taking home to my family”. These two quantities have no relation to each other in order of magnitude when you are in a competitive
                equilibrium, aside from the fact that if you are doing a good job, you get to take home more pay (but not commensurate with the millions you are investing).
            </p>
            <p>
                This difference is the difference between a “competitive price” and a “monopolists price”. A monopolist’s price is “the maximum you are willing to pay”. A competitive price is “What the next competitor in line charges”. To
                explain the difference, I’ll tell a story. There’s a screw that holds the arm of my glasses to the frame. It fell out, and I needed a replacement. How much was I willing to pay? Considering that the glasses cost $200, I was
                willing to pay $40. So I went to the store and found the screw. Did it cost $40? NO! It cost less than a penny, those screws were sold by the pound. Why the huge difference? Because I went in expecting a monopolist’s price,
                and I got a competitive price.
            </p>
            <p>
                In equilibrium, every price is a competitive price, and no price is a monopolist’s price. When you pay an investor for investment advice, and you are paying a competitive price, you pay the investor a professional salary.
                When the investor has a monopoly, they can ask you for a significant fraction of your profit from the investment itself. The difference between the two can be many orders of magnitude, as it was in the case of that screw.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whenever you are negotiating from a position of power, where you can get a significant fraction of a corporation’s income, on the order of a corporate profit of hundreds of millions of dollars, you are taking a monopolist’s
                price. All such individual pay is anti-competitive by nature, it is impossible to acquire such payment when there is a competitor undercutting you, and therefore, in an ideal world, such payments should be taxed murderously,
                at 90% like they were until the 60s.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s the central flaw in the thinking of people who say that they support “markets”. They don’t support theoretical markets in equilibrium, where investors make money indirectly in the way I described above. They support a
                class system where an individual can magnify his own property by the largely pointless activity of individual investment.

                “out of those 10 employees, 5 would still have significantly above minimum wage wages, and can be treated just like the owners of the small business” Are you NUTS? The mean wage at Walmart is $8 an hour. The number of “above
                minimum wage employees” at a chain store is 1 in 20 at best, and their wages rise so slowly (until you get to top managers) that it makes no difference to the mean. That’s half their margin.
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole point of such chain stores is that they take the local owners out of the picture. That’s the difference between “Dominoes PIzza” and a local pizza shop. That’s basically all that they do, destroy entrepreneurs and
                small business for reductions in quality and efficiency. They only survive because of a low minimum wage, bad zoning, and ridiculous corporate advertizing propaganda pushing consumers to shop against their best interests.
            </p>
            <p>
                This dynamic has nothing to do with government transaction taxes, or patents. Walmart doesn’t have a patent on anything, and Amazon’s patents are on nonsense. I also agree that patent reform and zoning reform are necessary,
                to fight this consolidation, but zoning is for local government, and patent reform is not easy because of big-money in politics from corporate patent-holders.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anti-trust needs to be based simply on size, as this doesn’t require specific regulation on each individual business. I agree Apple and Microsoft should be penalized equally (and as far as I am concerned, closed APIs, even
                closed software, should be illegal), but you don’t need to legislate it specifically after the fact, after the consolidation happens. You can institute anti-consolidation measures by having a progressive corporate income
                tax, and that will prevent the problems of consolidation in the first place, rather than requiring regulation.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are no real benefits of consolidation in most of the sectors that it happens. In those few cases where consolidation to nation-state level makes sense, the service basically should be a public utility, not a private
                company.
            </p>
            <p>
                I agree with you regarding airlines and government regulation, I strongly support the Carter administration’s deregulation measure. It was pro-competition, and it was mirrored in the 1996 telecom deregulation act, the part
                that led to small phone companies, not the part that allowed media consolidation (which was disasterous). But airlines reconsolidated later, and while the industry is still relatively competitive, it would also benefit from
                more competition.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point of socialism is to decentralize power. Government power is no good, and large business power is no good. The large business power simply doesn’t come from government. It comes when you allow a company to pay absurd
                wages to people, and use its size for political advantage in negotiating contracts. This is where the modern socialists try to craft policy to create competition and distributed ownership, so that the concentrations of power
                are prevented from forming in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t see the point of repeating this again and again, but the idea that big business forms with government help is a terrible delusion, there is not an iota of truth to it. Business consolidates when regulations allow it,
                and it can make a profit. It usually can, as it drives down mean wages and reduces materials costs through larger negotiating power. This needs to be offset by a size tax, and then you can have a nimble small-business
                economy, rather than a Soviet large-firm economy.

                People complain about Clinton not because she has right-wing policy, even though she has some of that, but mostly because she is such a secrecy nut! She loves everything top secret, secret-secret, so that only the top top
                brass and her can get to know the real policy. Her open positions are chosen by poll, her secret positions are known to her alone, and I for one want a transparent government with public officials who say what they mean,
                even when it is not so popular.
            </p>

                Hillary Clinton loves secretive shadow-government, she supported the coup in Honduras. Her signature is “we killed Bin Laden”, whatever that operation was. She pushes for disingenuous gun control lawsuits, instead of
                transparent legislation. She simply can’t work with honest government, everything has to be secret-secret back-channel.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her method of getting elected is pandering. In 2008, she said she would “open up those last JFK assassination files”, not because she is serious, but to pander to the JFK assassination crowd (Romney similarly pandered on
                “cold fusion” in Utah). This time around, she says positive things about UFOs and opening up area 51. This is not serious policy, this is lying to voters who are sick of being lied to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clinton blamed the Benghazi attack on an anti-Mohammad video on YouTube, and then disingenuously called for internet censorship to prevent such videos. That’s not responsible, it’s a level of dishonesty that you never want
                to see in a public official, even if it was legal. Her email scandal is due to her Nixonian paranoia— she won’t let others control her archives. This paranoia is shared by other denizens of secret government, like Cheney.
            </p>
            <p>
                There will be no improvement in government transparency with Clinton, it will get worse. The US has a serious problem with internal propaganda, with internal deception, and Clinton, like all the Republicans, is part of the

                weak to run on the real left. The last real progressive president won WWII. Your impression that the left must lose comes from the television days of 1972-2004, when there was no space for substance, only sound bites and
                photo-ops. The internet fixes that, and as the percentage of internet connected voters grows, the politics of the left gets stronger.

                Sanders won elections even without an internet, in Vermont. He had to do this by personal outreach, as national and local media were just as biased against him then as they are now. His organizational strength is superb, and
                he can make use of modern technology now to bring that organization to the national level.

                When Keynsianism leads to serious inflation, as it did in the 70s, then it is reducing the amount of investment capital systematically, and it comes at a cost of investment in the future. This is true. This is why in the
                70s, people supported austerity to get rid of inflation, on both sides. But Nixon was the one who overstimulated, and Carter lost his job due to austerity. So it’s only one side which is serious about economics.

                The money is “created out of the blue”. It is created ex-nihilo by a central bank, and the government gets it to workers directly through highway spending, mortgage subsidies, college subsidies, and various giveaways,
                including tax rebates and EITC. The result is deficit spending, but the tax base increases, and often offsets it, or if not, inflation gets rid of it eventually, as it got rid of WWII debt, or else you just raise taxes on
                the rich (in equilibrium, nobody is very rich).The tax and spending policies are sensible when they are pushing you toward equilibrium.
            </p>
            <p>For Keynsianism to avoid inflation, you simply have to have production not be maximum. It’s not even close to maximum right now, or at any reasonable period in the consumer sector.</p>
            <p>
                The modestly rich got rich by simply owning capital. Their investments are not particular smart, they don’t need to be entrepreneurs, or productive people, and the capital for investments doesn’t usually come from them, it
                comes from banks. There is no justification for anti-Keynesian thinking, it’s just a load of malarkey.

                I am not ignoring the facts. When you average labor costs for small business, to do a comparison with big business, you don’t just include the employees, you need to include the OWNERS TOO, not just the hired labor. A large
                chain replaces 5 owners and 5 employees, as in a coffee shop I go to, with 10 employees. The average wage in the chain is minimum wage. The average wage in the private coffee shop is the profit plus the minimum wage divided
                by two, which is higher. Hence a margin for the chain. A higher minimum wage cuts into the chain’s margin more than the private business.

                Your claim that market forces push toward equilibrium is false. Market forces push toward equilibrium when there is competition and distributed ownership. Under today’s market conditions, as in 19th century England or in the
                US before 1930, the market attempts to avoid market conditions by minimizing competition and paying a wage far below productivity. When you have big firms hiring, this is very easy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The government doesn’t do anything to cause this concentration of power, it happens spontaneously. THe evidence for this is overwhelming— the large firms took over England and the US in the early 20th century, when there was
                no regulation to speak of. They take over in the most deregulated industries the easies. To keep competition nowadays, the government has to arrange the market to be fair, as it did with airline deregulation, or telecom
                deregulation. Although these were called “deregulation”, what they really were is “pro-competitive regulation”, as the laws separated infrastructure from service, and allowed competitors to rent infrastructure at an equal
                rate, to prevent reconsolidation of infrastructure and service providers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The government is often wise enough and well-intentioned enough to restore competition and push the market toward equilibrium, because WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT EQUILIBRIUM LOOKS LIKE. The time when it isn’t wise enough and well
                intentioned enough is when you elect public officials who claim they want to “reduce government” and “free the public sector”. What that means is that they dismantle pro-competition regulation, and allow the concentrations
                of monopoly and oligarchy power that wreck the ability of market mechanisms to function.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am sorry that regulation is a difficult business, it is difficult, I don’t pretend it’s easy. What you have to stop pretending is that the makret magically fixes this stuff when the government gets out of the way. It
                hasn’t happened historically, it’s just wishful thinking, reinforced by propaganda from the business press.

                I don’t need to read it carefully. Inflation has nothing to do with “taking a loan from the future”. It’s just decreasing the value of money. It’s largely harmless at most normal rates except to investment capital, which is
                depreciated.
            </p>
            <p>
                The increased spending from raising minimum wage and hiring unemployed most definitely does exist, both in theory, and in reality. People spend more money because they have more money. I have nothing further to say, because

                The term “equilibrium” has a standard economic definition. Economic equilibrium is the situation where every product, wage, and service has a price which is competitive. That means an infinite number of competing suppliers
                are providing the service, the labor, or the product, and the infinite number of consumers choose their maximum utility, based on competitive cost.
            </p>
            <p>This is a theoretical model. There is a question of how accurate this model is. Is it true in the real world?</p>
            <p>You can tell, by checking the predictions of the theoretical model. There are a whole bunch:</p>
            <p>
                1. In equilibrium, any supplier raising prices by a small amount will lead to a collapse of demand. Any supplier lowering prices by a small amount will be operating at a loss. That means that every product has a fixed price,
                at which the price exactly compensates for the cost of raw materials and labor, for capital depreciation, and for return on investment, and has zero profit left over.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. In equilbrium, every wage is rigid— if you demand a higher wage, you get replaced by the next person in line. If you demand a slightly smaller wage, you immediately can find employment at any place which employs people
                such as yourself. This means all wages are roughly equal, up to small corrections for risk, sporadic work (e.g. actors), unusually short careers (e.g. sports figures), and quality of work (which accounts for a small factor
                of productivity). That means in equilibrium, nobody is making that much more than anyone else, and unemployment is zero percent, with everyone making an amount just equal to their productivity, and all the wages collectively
                just sufficient to purchase the entire production.
            </p>
            <p>That’s standard equilibrium. This is what you read about in economics textbooks.</p>
            <p>
                These predictions are ok for certain occupations. For example, computer programmers have a wage which is roughly commensurate with the prediction of point 2, they used to get a high wage when they were scarce, but once the
                wage became competitive, regardless of the fact that it’s hard work, the wages collapse to the mean.
            </p>
            <p>Likewise, the predictions of 1 are ok for small business of any sort. The profits of these businesses, as a rule, provide no more than the equivalent of a comfortable professional salary for the owner.</p>
            <p>
                The issue is that when you have concentrations of capital in large business, the predictions of equilibrium are completely wrong. The top managers siphon off corporate profits. People who have negotiating power and monopoly
                power, like the class of CEOs, or the class of media-monopoly celebrities, can demand exhorbitant salaries without competition. The predictions are dead wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most significantly, the wages for wage labor in these large industries bear no relation to the productivity of the workers. They collapse to subsistence, because when there is unemployment, the wage laborers have no
                negotiating power. They must take the least salary they can.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the BIGGEST failure of equilbrium theory— the existence of unemployment, and the failure of Say’s law (the wages being sufficient to purchase products). This failure is what Marx was writing about in Capital 1, and
                it is a FACT OF NATURE. In every economy with industrial firms and nonzero unemployment, the wages are far below productivity, the profits go through the roof, and the wages NEVER go to equilibrium.
            </p>
            <p>The fix Marx proposed is for the state to take over all the large firms. But if you aren’t going to do that, and it seems that this is not a good idea, then you need to redress the too-low wages by a mechanism.</p>
            <p>
                The proper mechanism is to raise minimum wage, and hire the unemployed to do whatever jobs they can, so that wage labor gets a higher wage. There’s nothing you can do, this is what the failure is in markets, and this is
                where you need to fix it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your writing shows that you don’t understand this concept of economic equilibrium. It’s not something I made up, it’s something that is the fundamental justification for capitalism— the equilbrium of capitalism is, in
                theory, extremely fair and egalitarian. It just isn’t so in real life.

                I verified the earth was round when I was a kid, working out that the distance out you can see goes as the square root of how high you are, and then checking that the formula works on various platforms (it does). On the
                other hand, I haven’t seen an interview with the principal and English teacher in that school, or the math and social studies teacher. I haven’t seen interviews with three different janitors and the cafeteria ladies. Nor

                A more traditionally American class of worker owned business is the private contractor, small privately owned farm or business, and small family restaurant, in which the majority of workers are usually owners, and the

                The larger businesses can be formed from smaller businesses by encouraging splits, using a progressive corporate income tax. Sanders does not support this, but he does support modest incentives for encouraging coops and
                worker owned businesses, and he does support a broad platform which is protective of small business and private contractors. Just health-care alone will help small business more than all other concievable reforms put
                together, while the higher minimum wage undercuts the ability of larger firms to take over local economies.

                It’s not only extremely liberal seminaries. The notion of “God” is clearly distinguished from the notion of “magic” or “supernatural events” by the Pope. It’s confusing because it’s a complicated notion with a mass
                following, so you get a lot of propaganda and misinformation. But if you want to know what “string theory” is, you ask a string theorist! You don’t go by the average understanding of a layperson who read a popular book about
                it. It’s the same with God.

                The notion of religion in the modern world, and the notion of God, is dealing with the problem of transferable universal ethics. The analysis of this problem leads you to a notion of a sort of “universal mind”, that tells
                you what the right thing to do is. The religions of the world personify this mind as a character in a pseudo-history, so as to make the concept clear and accessible. Sometimes fundamentalists then take the history too

                That article conflates all sorts of damages, slavery, Jim Crow, housing discrimination and redlining, educational discrimination, job discrimination, access to capital discrimination, promotion discrimination, all that— some
                with recent victims, some with victims long dead. It puts redress for all of these different issues under the blanket title of “reparations”. That’s an emotional appeal to recognize the reality of racism, not a blueprint for
                any policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Damages from discrimination are certainly real, and one can get redress from the courts by making a case and winning it. But I can’t imagine a sensible proposal for a piece of legislation or executive order which can do any
                sort of reparations in any sensible way. The specific damages depend on the circumstances of each individual and class, and depending on the instance, it’s a different amount of damages. That’s what courts are for, not
                congress, or the president.

                How can you criticize a candidate using this? This kind of criticism would make sense only if Sanders was blind to race issues. But he’s the exact opposite. His response to BLM was exemplary, and he’s the only candidate to
                reach out to the protesters with comprehensive policy, and a serious hire. It’s his opponent who is ignoring race issues. So it’s really just a hit piece, with no merit.

                This is why his support of Black Lives Matter was so important. He hired the other Sanders, the Black Lives Matter leader, to join his campaign. He listened to the grievances fairly and equitably, and came out with a strong
                racial-justice platform that he has made a center of his campaign. That’s a very strong response, and it blows Clinton out of the water.

                They aren’t thin, they are focused. You can’t campaign on every issue, because each strong stance loses you support. HIs “biggie” stances are already very damaging in the mainstream media, so he has used up his political
                capital on the most important issues, and he doesn’t have much left. You need to consider whether his focus is on the most important issues or whether he missed the mark. You also need to consider whether his judgement and
                history on other issues means that he is going to do the right thing regarding those issues at that time when they come up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Considering Sanders and the alternative, I think the answer is yes. He hits the nail right on the head. I support Sanders because he is fighting at exactly those points where it can do most good to fight right now, and he
                promises to show sound judgement in future fights as well. This is not true of his opponent.

                Racial injustice is usually better addressed by the courts, as they can make assessment of damages while listening to the concerns of a minority with a grievance, while the president and congress are beholden to majorities
                who usually don’t know anything about specific instances of discrimination.

                The other “radical” proposals all have at least 51% support among Americans, and are usually at 80%. That’s what makes them different. But Sanders is strong on racial issues as well, just not on reparations, which are not
                even a good idea, as a payoff doesn’t fix racism or access to capital.

                Economic analysis of politics is always useful, but it is systematically ignored by the mainstream press, so one does have to push harder to get this analysis in the media. Sure, it isn’t everything in life, there is racism
                that goes beyond economics, there is sexism that isn’t manifested in lower wages, and there are international conflicts that are not driven entirely by the distribution of money and resources. It’s just that these are very
                few, and so one should focus on the main issue first. It’s a question of getting your priorities straight.

                God in the modern religious tradition is not supernatural. It’s more like an abstract mind teleologically formed at the endpoint of evolution. This is something a Catholic advocated, with the “Omega point” business, but it’s
                really at the heart of religion since around 0AD, that’s what differentiates modern religion from superstition. The superstitions of the ancient world died when modern religion took over, as the modern religions all
                renounced soothsaying, spells, and all that other nonsense, not so much because they are the work of the devil, as some would have it, but because, paraphrasing Maimonides, that nonsense just doesn’t work.

                Those smaller margins are succeptible to organizational strength— a 55/45 majority can be overcome with a 25% increase in Democratic turnout. Even in safe Republican districts, an organized opposition can primary a
                challenger and switch sides and register as Republicans to vote out an opponent. Sanders positions are often popular with Republicans too, just less so. Organized opposition is the bugaboo of any politician, they don’t want
                a national organization that opposes them. Unlike Sanders, they are cowards, that’s how they were bought out in the first place.

                You obviously never tried to write a rap, it’s the string theory of poetry. Typical song lyrics and typical poetry are about equally difficult: e.g. “You say Hello, I say Goodbye”. The words come on the beat, and they come

                Rap is fiendish at the next level, because the delivery is polyrhythmic, it comes on off-beats, so you can’t just make it up, unless you want to sound like a wannabe. You need to sit down and compose, for hours and days, and
                the meter is tied to the melody, like a song, except the syllables come three times as fast as in a standard song. It’s like bebop in words.

                That level of poetry goes into the first MINUTE of this song, it’s delivered in 70 seconds. That amount of material would supply lyrics for six ordinary Beatles or Beach Boys songs, and the imagery and word-flow makes for a
                top-notch stand-alone poem, ignoring the delivery. This is the typical high-level artistry of the craft. You can see Keny Arkana do it in French, there are folks doing it in Arabic, whatever. It’s the hardest

                Sanders is a bigger constitutionalist than Cruz, as he opposed the Patriot act, opposes the warrantless evesdropping, opposes the detention of US citizens without habeus corpus protection, opposes the militarization of
                police, and opposes the creation of secret prisons where people are locked away and tortured. Cruz believes in the erosion of liberty in the name of a faceless manipulated war on terror.

                Sanders supports the entire bill of rights, including, courageously, the second amendment. Nobody on the Republican side has endorsed the bill of rights since G.W. Bush has been president. So Beck, I would recommend that you
                vote for Sanders, even if Cruz were the nominee, as you are right that honesty and constitutional principles are important. Cruz is not very honest at all, just a typical politician, which is only slightly more honest than
                Trump.

                Nobody is forcing the small business owner to give his business to his employees. The small business which is worker owned will just have to compete against the small business which is top-down, and we’ll see which business
                is more efficient. You don’t impose change from the top by force, you let people decide what kind of society they want to have from the bottom.

                The point of progressive corporate income tax is to reduce the centralization of power, to ensure that there is an incentive for a split, not just for a merger. The market likes mergers for anti-competitive reasons. When you
                have a monopoly like Amazon or Facebook, you can make outrageous profits which are impossible when there is competition.

                The fall of prices with Standard Oil is due to technology advances which are accomplished by R&amp;D in house, and when that R&amp;D is shared with a large number of companies contractually, a distributed model can do better
                than a centralized model.
            </p>
            <p>
                The failure of the Soviet Union was a failure of centralization, and the US is centralizing in the same way. You need to restore distributed ownership and American small business, before it disappears and your entire economy
                is large firms ruled by oligarchs. If you want to see how that turns out, look at post-Soviet Russia. The state just handed off its monopolies to well-connected individuals, producing oligarchy from communism overnight. The
                US is just producing that oligarchy more slowly, without passing through communism.

                In most small businesses, the farmer owns the farm, the shop-keeper owns the store, the family owns the restaurant. They may hire 2 employees, but the majority of people working in the business are owners. This is still true
                in many small businesses and private farms. Even when the workers are not owners, they know the owner personally, and have a large say in their conditions, and the results are a responsive workplace, nearly the same as if
                they were owners. This dynamic is why Americans hold the concept of inalienable property rights so dear. It’s not to protect oligarchs. It’s to protect their farm and business.
            </p>
            <p>
                As business gets larger and consolidates the ratio of owners to employees gets smaller and smaller, until in modern corporations, it is effectively zero. When that happens, the employees have no say in their workplace, and
                they become effective slaves to a distant corporate headquarters.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s why we have the publicly traded corporation and encourage public stock, and allow workers to unionize and demand better wages and conditions, so that the same relations that hold in small business will be restored in
                big business. The problem is that today this public stock is used to enrich board members, not create distributed ownership, unions are corrupted or nonexistant, and the corporate leadership is taking over the economy, and
                destroying the small business economy.

                That’s true in principle, but I think that the best way to achieve worker control of business is to encourage small business. The next best way is to have public ownership of stock, without stock-options to insiders, so that
                the public can trade corporate ownership. The third best way is to encourage workers to build privately owned worker-owned business. All of these require a government that protects property rights, not a government that
                takes them away.

                It is best if you stick to the terminology “communism = USSR”, “socialism = Yugoslavia”, “Democratic socialism = Scandinavia” and “Social Democracy = England, France, Germany”, because that’s what everyone else uses. If you
                have a new idea, you should describe it instead of misusing old labels.

                Your previous POTUS put people in camps and tortured them. He stigmatized and maligned a minority, in this case Muslims. He invaded countries with trumped up excuses and false flags. That’s directly from the pages of the
                Nazi party. He created a massive government bureaucracy of homeland security and NSA, whose only purpose is to take away freedom. He got rid of archaic provisions like habeus corpus.

                In the Bible, it says you have to burn in a ditch anyone who sleeps with both a woman and her mother, like Dustin Hoffman’s character in the graduate. This isn’t the 7th century, and nobody lives like that today. When you
                see an organization using this kind of terror, it is not a religious organization, but an organization seeking power by means other than winning friends and influencing people.

                His opposition to the Patriot act came with opposition to torture and rendition, to violations of Habeus corpus, with opposition to the arrest and imprisonment of Americans and “terrorists” without charges. He has supported
                the first amendment from those who have intimidated journalists, and sold access to the highest bidder, or even from those in his own party who wish to censor Islamic propaganda. He has supported the fourth and fifth
                amendment, while everyone else is calling for expanded police powers and militarized takeovers of cities, like the Boston lockdown.

                This is the exact opposite of the truth. The individual rights are not only oppressed by government, they are also oppressed by big business, and in the collusion of big business and government. The only way to preserve your

                You don’t have private ownership of your healthcare anymore, you have corporate ownership of your healthcare. Health is a special industry where there is a real benefit in public ownership, with private add-ons. The French
                system is probably the best. Without this, US business is less competitive, as the health costs are a nightmare for small business. It makes sense to have universal health care taken care of by the state, although it also
                makes sense to have a competitive system within the state system, as in France, rather than a bureaucratic system as in England.

            <p>The same consolidation of business, and corruption in the private sector, happened in the 1890s in the gilded age, and in the 1920s in the second gilded age. Back then, there was no government to speak of.</p>
            <p>
                Government doesn’t enable monopoly, it is the only thing that can prevent it. I personally would like to see a structural remedy, and I favor a graduated corporate income tax so that big business would be taxed at a higher
                rate than small business. This would make a financial incentive for firms to split, and involves no meddlesome bureaucratic regulation.
            </p>
            <p>Your idea that government causes the monopolization is simply false. Standard Oil, AT&amp;T, all those had to be broken up by government to restore competition.</p>
            <p>
                Sanders doesn’t advocate any policies that unduly increase government, aside from universal health-care, which is a tried and successful policy in other nations. He is very conservative in his approach, because he needs
                majority support. I am not so cautious, because I am just spouting off online.

                People who call themselves communists believe the government should own all the industry and business in a country. Classic Socialists don’t believe that, they believe in greater worker protections and partial takeover of
                industry. Anarchic socialists believe in worker ownership of industry, while Social Democrats just believe in expanded social services. Bernie Sanders is ultimately just a Social Democrat, and that puts him square inside the
                Democratic party. His only socialist leaning plank is some modest incentives to encourage more worker owned business.

                I agree there are wealthy donors who support ISIS, and governments, but there is no way a sensible citizen could support this nonsense. It’s insane, it’s barbaric, and contrary to the law and custom in Syria and Iraq for
                hundreds of years. The people who work for ISIS do so under financial compulsion, and would not vote for ISIS in a free election. They are just like the Khmer Rouge, who also rode to power on barbaric threats of force, in
                another region destabilized by the US, in this case, due to the Vietnam war.

                NOBODY supports it in a region which is still free, in a sample of 1000 people. You don’t get results like that with a real popular movement, I mean, even Hitler gets nonzero support today in Germany, although it’s teeny
                tiny. It’s a bunch of externally financed nutcases who took over some oil fields, and are soon going to die.

                That’s true. But the effect of salvation of the soul is that you see the other as part of the body of Christ, and you form a community mindful of the dignity of all members. This transformation leads to social change, it is
                what allowed the slavery abolition of the 2nd-7th century, which completed peacefully in Europe, albeit at a glacial pace. Spartacus and Bar-Giora tried violent revolt, and that didn’t go anywhere.

                The Marxists take the community and brotherhood, and remove the spiritual message, substituting a brotherhood of labor. The spiritual message is similar, although it works best if they are combined tactfully, respecting
                science and spirituality, and economics at the same time. The Marxist violent revolt didn’t go anywhere either, it just led to tyranny.

                You need to split hairs very finely, because that determines whether government gets bigger or smaller. The goal of socialism is to decentralize economic power. That doesn’t require centralizing government power, it can
                decentralize both government and economy at the same time, although this is extremely tricky to do.
            </p>

                It opposes Christianity because it aims to replace it. The social justice aims are similar. It’s hard to see, because Christianity is very wedded to all sorts of metaphysical things which Marxism rejects as bunk, but the

            <p>Sanders doesn’t really have a vision of any actual socialism, he just advocates some modest reforms. I just want to say that, because what I say is not endorsed by Bernie Sanders.</p>
            <p>
                But other people do have a vision of a non-governmental version of socialism. The libertarian socialist idea does not involve government compulsion, it’s about transitioning to businesses which are mostly owned by their
                workers, or else publically traded. Personally, I don’t accept government anything. If people don’t voluntarily do it, it’s not worth doing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The alternate vision of socialism, worker owned businesses, was very successful in the US, when most businesses were worker owned small businesses, and most farms were small private plots. You just didn’t call it socialism,
                because you didn’t see that the alternative is gigantic corporations controlling every aspect of your life. In the 1910s, Teddy Roosevelt busted up the trusts to restore American business, in the 1940s, FDR introduced
                unionization and Keynsianism, and now Sanders is introducing universal health care, and a new round of trust-busting to go after the big banks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sanders has advocated constitutional government, and supports the entire bill of rights. None of his platform violates property rights any more than progressive taxation does, and his vision of socialism is distributed
                ownership, not dictatorial imposition. It has little to do with government, but with individuals making their own choices.
            </p>
            <p>
                For others who advocate much more radical visions along the same lines, again, with little or no government involvement, there’s Noam Chomsky, and fellow Vermonter Murray Bookchin. Sanders is just a social Democrat, these
                folks, are actual anarchists (libertarian socialists).

                Stalin was a tin-pot dictator who constructed a top-down economy run like a single corporation, for an entire nation of 200 million people. His decisions were ultimately disasterous, and ruined the good name of socialism to
                the point where even to this day, modest efforts to reduce unemployment and provide health care can be attacked with hysterical responses along the lines of “you’re going to starve millions of people”. There is nothing good
                about Stalin. He ran the USSR like Steve Jobs ran Apple, except with concentration camps.

                Daniel Ortega, who was reelected president as Christian, after losing as a Marxist in the 80s.

                to do much of anything except go to the right school and be reasonably effective at office politics to get to that position. When they get there, they often kick out the true entrepreneurs,like Steve Jobs, or the fellow who
                founded Men’s Wearhouse.
            </p>
            <p>
                They also make crazy amounts of money through IPO whenever wall-street smells that they might have a monopoly. This is how Bezos, Gates and that Facebook fellow made their billions, and that Musk guy. These are
                anti-competitive practices, not healthy market profits. The way these corporations stay competitive is by buying out the competition, not by innovation, at least, not by successful innovation (they try and try, but fail and
                fail).

                Sanders does not advocate handouts. He advocates making an economy where labor gets a fair wage, because anyone can find a job, because unemployment is low enough to be nonexistent. He does that with pro-employment policies
                like a higher minimum wage (this decreases unemployment, paradoxically to a non-Keynesian), subsidized college, and an infrastructure jobs program. He lets the market take care of the rest.

                There is nothing there that takes from productive members of society, it is rather equalizing the playing field so that workers are not ripped off by having to charge ridiculously low prices for their labor, in relation to
                their productivity.

                He does not advocate nationalization of industry. He advocates protecting small business from predatory big business by leveling the playing field, breaking up banks, and introducing measures to make the US economy safe and
                competitive like universal health-care and breaking up the big banks. The type of socialism radical Americans like Noam Chomsky talk about involve a gradual voluntary transition to worker owned businesses, like small
                business and corporations with publicly owned stock, not state owned monopolies like in the USSR.

                More like “change it back” to the FDR economic doctrine and the small-business economy it was founded on. In the current US, more businesses close than open every year, and if left uncorrected, you will have every store a
                chain store, and every employee a slave.

                There are two major flavors of socialism— one where the state owns all business and industry, the Soviet model, and this was never highly favored by many American socialists, due to the terrible experience in the USSR. The
                other flavor asks for workers to be owners in their own industry, to increase productivity by ownership.
            </p>
            <p>
                This second form of socialism doesn’t change property rights, and is implicit in calls to protect small business, independent private contractors, and small family farms, which are worker owned by default, as the majority of
                workers in these businesses are owners too. This is not only consistent with American values, it was a Republican concern for many decades to preserve small business ownership and entrepreneurship, before corporate
                sponsorship shifted the party to care only about big business. The decline of American small business in recent decades is catastrophic, and it goes hand in hand with the mergers in banking, and in retail, in movie houses,
                in grocery stores, and everything else.

                Bernie Sanders has not advocated any kind of national control of industry, but he does call for greater worker say in the workplace, and for more small business activity, protected from predatory monopoly. That’s as far as
                his socialism goes in his platform, and it’s very meager for any real socialist. Basically, he’s asking for small business, and greater support for worker cooperatives, and less emphasis on large heirarchical business, which
                is the opposite of the Soviet model of an economy.
            </p>

                Guys like Sanders hold their views because their views are more or less objectively correct. You are right that these views are not compatible with the culture of business in America. That is because business in America is a
                class based race, you need to show how domineering you are to win, because it requires jockying for power in a completely different way than building a coalition for government.
            </p>
            <p>Business deals are done in competition, government is a monopoly. Business can impose conditions on workers top-down, they have no real say. Our government is not a dictatorship, it has to listen.</p>
            <p>
                Part of listening is taking protest seriously, and considering what changes can be made to accomodate real grievance. Unlike other candidates, Sanders politely listens to all the sides, and makes his decisions transparently.
                This is the only kind of government I am willing to support.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding business, when you are talking about small business, like a start up, or a family owned firm, or a private contractor, the decisions are also made in the same way. The only time you get complete top-down control is
                when it’s a disconnected egomaniacal billionaire on top, setting up a Soviet-style bureaucracy to run a gigantic firm. This is about as innovative and efficient as the Soviet Union, and I’d personally like to see a little
                bit less of that. How about you?

                be heard, and people will make up their mind which ones to accept and which to reject. Sanders doesn’t aim to silence others, he aims to win on correct policy.

                Coates has an agenda that I don’t share. He wants to make it seem that the way to fight against racism is to ignore class barriers and focus only on racial discrimination in applying class barriers. This is ultimately
                because he really isn’t a Democratic Socialist, he’s an aspiring member of the American Black elite. So he wants to make sure that the barriers of race are overcome, without overcoming the barriers of class. That way, a
                Black elite is allowed to have commensurate power along with the White elite. It’s the Republican version of anti-racism— a rainbow coalition of billionaires telling you what to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal for Sanders is to reduce the powers of elites altogether, by progressive taxation, by reducing umemployment, by increasing educational opportunity, and by encouraging small business and decentralized industries,
                rather than consolidation. Such policies are always opposed by members of any elite, whether black or white, but they have always been good for the economy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Black elite faces a further challenge in selling their vision, because every African American person is aware of systemic racial discrimination, and therefore is automatically also aware of class discrimination, in a way
                that many Americans of European ancestry are not. So Coates has a harder sell for his vision of anti-discrimination measures that don’t touch class, and that involves more “white guilt”, and less specific redress to class
                barriers.

                You forget that Sanders was right in the 80s, which is why he is so popular today. The Reagan administration supplied arms and aid to the Contras opposing Ortega, illegally, and sometimes through turning a blind-eye to
                drug-running by South American cartels that are today destroying the region. They also helped defeat Ortega in the 80s, by advising the opposition on ads and research.

                Three decades later, Ortega was reelected president of an empoverished Nicaragua. Ortega is still president today, although he is now a Christian socialist rather than a revolutionary. During the same three decades, Reagan’s

                Sanders has consistently protected Vermont small business, and wins Republican support for it. His vision of the economic future involves many small businesses opening, rather than closing, and his attacks are on the large
                corporations which make it next to impossible to operate small business in the current US system. His vision of Democratic Socialism means some expansion of social services, a thriving small business sector, and greater
                worker ownership in larger industry. This used to be the standard vision on the Republican side.

                In the 80s, the Soviets did not exactly threaten the US with nuclear annihilation, they had a clear “no first strike” policy. The US didn’t have this policy, and Ronald Reagan UNINTENTIONALLY threatened the Soviets with
                nuclear annihilation— not because he was serious about starting war, but through misstatements, so as to gain political points for “looking strong”. These misstatments included VP George Bush musing about surviving limited
                nuclear war, others talking about tactical nuclear war limited to the battlefield, calling the Soviets an “evil empire” (which led to panic in Andropov’s USSR that war was imminent), and deployment of Pershing II missiles in
                Europe which could reach Moscow and destroy it in less than 10 minutes. The Soviet early-warning system couldn’t deal with such a short time, so it led to hair-trigger response chains, and risked accidental war. The greatest
                crisis came in 1983, with the Korean air shoot down (which the Soviets believed was an American covert operation), and the “Able Danger” military drill, simulating starting nuclear war at the peak of Soviet paranoia. Does
                this, in hindsight, constitute a responsible nuclear was policy?
            </p>
            <p>
                Reagan cut it out in 1984, after he saw the made for TV movie “The Day After”. But before that point, his administration harkened back to Curtis LeMay and Douglas McArthur, their absurd nuclear war stances, and Barry
                Goldwater’s similarly ridiculous stance. Nuclear war is never an option, I hope I don’t have to say that today.

                Sanders supported peace, not communism. He supported self-determination, not coups. Now that the Soviets are gone, you can see what kind of opponent the US faced in the communist block— a weak and ineffectual one, as

                All their advantage on prices comes either from the low-wages of employees, effectively the government is subsidizing WalMart with food-stamps and section 8, and from anti-competitive practices, like special prices from
                distributors and local dumping to put the competitors out of business one by one. These practices are odious, and usually illegal.
            </p>
            <p>It won’t hurt to have a consumer boycott as well. Keeping small business healthy is a form of ecology which everyone can practice every time they shop.</p>

            <p>Thanks. this is the first time I learned something from a comment discussion regarding Sanders. I’ll keep it in mind, and lay off Chavez until I get it straight.</p>
            <p>
                I will point out that oil prices fluctuated over 50 years, and Venezuelan GDP per capita fluctuated too, except for Chavez, where it spikes like crazy and stays stable at double the amount it was before. It’s still double
                now, despite the drop in oil prices, and the attendant problems.

                They wouldn’t go out of business right away, it will be store closings at first, then regional failure, then bankruptcy, over decades. Walmart, Best Buy, ShopRite. Their margins over small business consist of two things—
                their average labor cost is lower, because small business has a bunch of owners who make serious money, while nearly all their employees are making minimum wage. The other major thing is that their supply cost is also lower,
                because they use their size for leverage. This can be fixed by fair-pricing regulation to allow small business the same prices as big business.
            </p>
            <p>
                They have additional political advantages: in zoning, which Sanders can’t do anything about, but your local community can, in advertizement budgets, which the public needs to resist, to preserve the health of the small
                business economy.
            </p>
            <p>
                These chains also have the ability to dump products below cost to put competitors out of business, which is a violation of the Sherman act. Amazon has done this for years to put local booksellers out of business, but it is
                standard practice. It is also illegal, but nobody ever sues.
            </p>
            <p>
                The minimum wage is part of a full-employment policy. Nobody likes to work for a chain, so their equilibrium wage would necessarily have to be far higher than at a comparable small business, just to attract labor. It isn’t
                now. And that’s only because unemployment is high. At low unemployment, they wouldn’t find labor to work for them unless they raised wages and prices to the point that they were not competitive.
            </p>
            <p>
                The transformation of the American economy away from small privately owned business to enormous chains and multinationals is not ancient history, it’s recent history. And it needs to be reversed to keep the economic
                diversity and progress alive. Large chains and enormous corporations are more Soviet than American, they are monstrosities.

                Wages for everyone will not double, wages at the lowest income will double. Wages for middle income workers will rise a little bit, and wages for very high income top managers at the top of corporate chains will go down
                drastically. The income for small business owners should be overall stable, although some will gain (those who serve working people who will have more money to spend), and some will lose (yacht sellers, mansion builders), it
                will change things around, as usual for an economy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The companies will not have to double their labor costs overnight, the wages will rise slowly, and the extra spending will offset it. It is much harder for WalMart than for a mon-and-pop store to deal with the minimum wage
                increase. The experiment has already done, the Australian minimum wage is $15, and their median income is $60,000, which is half again as much as the median US income, despite the US having a higher per-capita GDP than
                Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
                The worst case scenario is inflation kicking in, which I guarantee you will not happen. Inflation should kick in at about $25 an hour, when the productivity rise is matched by the minimum wage rise. I can’t play devil’s
                advocate, because this prediction is more or less an immutable fact, it is as certain as anything about economics can be.
            </p>
            <p>Business folks often have a myopic view of minimum wage policy, because they see their labor costs, but not the overall macro spending and how it benefits them.</p>

                Yeah, everyone knows. Except the USSR was not theoretical, it was a real place and it was full of hard financial incentives. There were incentives for managers to produce more, incentives for workers to complete degrees and
                move to better jobs, incentives for workers to produce more on the job. The pay in the USSR wasn’t equal, and people competed like crazy to get ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
                The incentive structure of the USSR mirrors that of a large firm. The failure of the USSR is also a failure of large firms. The small business that led the West to victory is disappearing today in the West, and it needs to
                be revitalized.

                the mistakes. That’s what Democracy is about.

            <p>
                Jobs will get displaced, gradually, obviously. But the biggest effect should be reducing the margin of chains, where the employees are often making minimum wage. Chains have additional advantages, and these need to be dealt
                with separately.
            </p>
            <p>With a high minimum wage and very low unemployment, chains go out of business, as nobody wants to work for them, and better off customers aren’t forced to shop there.</p>

                and never enacted.

                It is very difficult for me to say anything against Chavez given the opposition’s behavior. They staged false flags to get him out, they shot their own supporters and blamed it on the military. The coup was supported by the
                G.W. Bush administration, who had just staged a false flag in the US. The day after the coup, military divisions were setting up death squads for Chavez followers, they would have been murdered Pinochet style if the coup had
                been successful.

                I also can’t oppose someone who won elections, nationalized the oil industry, eradiced illiteracy, and reduced deep poverty, even if his policies were totally wrong regarding industry and agriculture, which I can believe
                given the track record of his type of socialists regarding this stuff. Deep poverty means 25% are living in garbage dumps in total destitution, on the brink of starvation, and whatever happens to industry, this is a national
                emergency for any country, except 75% of the people don’t see it that way, because that 25% is invisible to them, the way homeless people are invisible to you.
            </p>
            <p>The opposition is in power now, they can fix whatever mistakes were made. That’s what Democracy is for.</p>

        <div>
            <p>
                This is what is difficult about economics. Money is not a conserved quantity, and it is possible to raise everyone’s living standard by simply increasing production of goods and services. This is what happens in an economy
                out of equilibrium, when you bring it closer to equilibrium. The biggest non-equlibrium effect in an industrial economy is the collapse of worker wages to subsistence, due to competition with the unemployed. Minimum wage
                increases and maximum working hours regulation counteract this tendency, until the demand is high enough and the unemployment low enough that it is not necessary anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
                What that means is that when raising the minimum wage doesn’t result in inflation, it is only increasing production. It’s not simple and intuitive, all the simple intuitive pictures you paint are wrong. It’s Keynesian. This
                is a counterintuitive Keynesian theoretical prediction that is verified in the real world whenever minimum wage goes up.
            </p>
            <p>
                The people already making $13,$15,$17 have some bargaining power, and would be making $25,$29,$33. Their pay will go up, and if there is no inflation, that means production caught up with the new purchasing, and every worker
                just got richer. If not, there will be a doubling of prices, and everyone will be the same as before, except half the investment capital will disappear. That’s what happens when you stimulate too much.
            </p>
            <p>
                This phenomenon is what makes monetary policy under capitalism pure magic. There is no law of conservation of purchases, at least not when production is not maximum, i.e. before inflation starts. A rise in minimum wage, when
                the wage is extremely low, only improves the situation for everyone. The trick is to do it just until inflation kicks in. Right now, monetary policy is only going to banks, and doesn’t improve purchasing except indirectly,
                by getting more workers hired in businesses started by loans. A minimum wage increase gets money into worker pockets directly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The magic line where inflation starts is the productivity of the average low-pay employee. The productivity is currently much more than $15/hour, which means that the low-cost labor generates enormous profits for those at
                the top of gigantic chains employing this labor. The destruction of small business by chains is partly a result of these too low minimum wages, which end up subsidizing large chains, to the detriment of the whole economy.

                You can’t double GDP based on oil alone, a large part must be the demand generated by redistributive measures, and the incentives for new cooperative industry. Oil revenue is for foreign reserves to buy import products, but
                Venezuela has local production too. You also can’t cut poverty by half and deep poverty by more than half without lifting a whole lot of people out of the most desperate situation of any people on Earth. I am only looking at
                his economic statistics, they’re excellent by any standard.
            </p>
            <p>
                He didn’t threaten anyone in any election. The Venezuelan press was entirely free, and hated him, and reported every slip of the tongue of his. When he lost a referendum on additional presidential powers narrowly, he
                accepted the results. He never had a problem getting re-elected, and he respected the electoral process. That is a first for his radical brand of socialist.
            </p>
            <p>
                I respect the will of the Venezuelan electorate. If 60% of the people supported him, he must have been doing something to improve their lives. In the most recent election, he party lost seats, and I have heard it attributed
                to corruption.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t like it when people second-guess some other country’s electorate. When people vote in a free and fair election, you shouldn’t go around denying their vote. The only people who used the military in Venezuela were
                those who plotted the coup against Chavez, and who engaged in false-flag shootings to stir the public against him. It didn’t work there, and it shouldn’t work here.

                Because that’s what it is in Australia, and they have better incomes and standard of living there. A living wage cuts unemployment because it puts more money in worker’s pockets. It’s good for small business, because they
                get more customers (although they don’t see it that way), and it is good for small business because it cuts into the ability of chain stores to displace them through slave wages.

                I am explaining why it failed, and exactly how. No conservative understands why it failed, as when they see the details of the USSR, they scratch their heads and say “why didn’t it work”? Because, once you get into the guts
                of how the USSR was run, the mechanisms are the same as any mega-corporation. They had the same incentive pay, the same division of labor, the same economic calculation, the same bureaucracy.
            </p>
            <p>
                It didn’t work because it didn’t have small business, and therefore no innovation. It also had no competition, and therefore giant firms were stuck in time. Competition and fine-grained division of power are required, and
                that lesson is transferrable to a Capitalist economy.

                Poverty was at 60% when Chavez took office, and deep poverty at 25%. He cut the poverty rate by more than half over his time in office. He also had 5% average annual growth the whole time, and presided over a net 100% net
                increase in Venezuelan GDP. That means the Venezuelan economy doubled in size, for an ignoramus.

                numbers like inflation rate and unemployment, and you either get these right, or wrong. Keynes is really ripping off Marx, the theory of declining demand and too-low worker pay driven by unemployment is already found in
                Capital I. Unlike Marx, Keynes tells you how to fix it while staying in Capitalism. But it’s the same issue.

                The other option that you missed is that maybe there is a non-governmental path toward worker owned business. It’s not all “government” or “gigantic monopolies”. There is also small business,and worker managed business in

                He’s not an idiot— his vision for Democratic Socialism simply doesn’t involve state-ownership of anything, but more competitive worker owned business. Every private business which is one-person or family owned is
                worker-owned by default, there are many worker-owned businesses, and making more worker owned business used to be a Republican goal, before they were bought out.

                I don’t think Bernie Sanders is naive enough to think Walmart can be worker owned, given it’s structure. But I think he knows that it will lose any competitive edge in a market with a fair minimum wage and good fair-practice
                policies, that prevent it from bankrupting all competition by dumping and anti-competitive contracts with suppliers.
            </p>
            <p>
                That means that once minimum wage is $15, and workers aren’t forced to work at WalMart, they have other options, Walmart will be at a competitive disadvantage, and it can be replaced again with the same network of healthy
                American small businesses that it displaced,mostly family owned or worker owned. All this without state coercion or heavy handed intervention, just with modest tax incentives. These kinds of small businesses areinnovative
                and efficient, they don’t need to be imposed from on high.

                I didn’t contradict myself. I agree with you that the 1932 famine was a direct result of the state taking over EXISTING means of farming production, by collectivizing farms. That’s because the farmers revolted, justifiably,
                and didn’t want to give up their farms!
            </p>
            <p>
                That had nothing to do with industry, where the USSR built everything from scratch, according to the first two five year plans. The heavy industry, which was done by enormous firms, was completely competitive with the West,
                where it was also done by enormous firms. The USSR had no problems keeping up in the energy sector, in steel production, in military parity, in the nuclear industry. Basically, they were competitive in any industry where the
                West is dominated by large firms.
            </p>
            <p>
                They were NOT competitive anywhere the West was dominated by small firms. Soviet farms were competitive with factory farms, but not with small farmers who supply breeds, seeds, and various services. Soviet consumer goods
                were comparable to one supplier, like GE, not to the totality of all suppliers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Soviet famine lasted one year, it was not in any way deliberate, although it was exploited to set up collective farms quickly and get a lot labor into cities for the simultaneous industrialization of the first five year
                plan. There was no other famine, unless you mean from the civil war period, when the new state didn’t have an economic policy at all, at least no coherent one (it jumped from policy to policy, war communism, inflating money
                away, NEP, etc).
            </p>
            <p>The lines in the Soviet union had nothing to do with Reagan, he did nothing to the Soviets one way or another, except make them paranoid about him starting nuclear war.</p>

                There was some of that, but it wasn’t because they loved fascism so much, it was because they hated statist solutions. The non-statist solution to the problems of capitalism has never been spelled out. But Keynesianism has
                gone half-way with some state-measures designed to mitigate the worst problem— the drop in demand from too-low worker pay.

                What people called “socialism” in the USSR was what people called “communism” elsewhere. What people called “communism” in the USSR is what we would call “utopia”. The goal of the communists was to get to communism by
                producing as much as possible so that there would be general plenty, and their production was through state-owned monopolies.
            </p>
            <p>The problems of the USSR were the concentration of state power and monopoly power, leading to unbelievable corruption, and terrible goods.</p>
            <p>
                Socialists never advocated Marxism-Leninism, but a move toward social services, and a shift toward more decentralized ownership of industry. Social democrats even drop the decentralized ownership and just give social
                services their attention. Bernie Sanders is just a social Democrat, with preference for small worker owned business.

                The empty shelves started in the late 1980s, ironically enough, due to free-market reforms (not that these are bad). Once Gorbachev introduced profitability as a goal rather than production quotas, the factories would make
                more money by exploiting shortages to raise prices, because they were all gigantic monopolies. Before the 80s, in the 60s and 70s, there simply weren’t serious shortages in the USSR. It was just that all the goods were bad
                copies of much more innovative and flashy Western models.

                The famine in China was a collectivization famine, which also happened in the USSR in 1932. It’s atrocious, but it has nothing to do with the history of the USSR post Stalin. I am not an advocate of the system, but you need
                to understand it’s problems honestly, not make ones up, because these problems happen in the West also, just to a lesser extent. The problems are concentrations of monopoly power, which happens also in a free market economy.
                In the USSR, everything was a state monopoly.

                More of a social-democrat, or anarchist-leaning socialist, like nearly all modern socialists. It’s not a slur. He’s not in favor of any of the statist measures of recent years, like black-ops, unlimited surveillance,
                destruction of habeus corpus, second-amandment violations, or the obscene torture and rendition policy. All but gun-rights violation are Republican measures, they constitute a step toward real fascism, and not all have been
                revesed by Democrats. If you are an anti-statist, you should look in Sanders direction. He doesn’t increase government power unduly in any of his measures, and he reduces concentrations of private power, like Teddy
                Roosevelt, by trust-busting.

                There are plenty of worker-run companies in the US— every family owned and run small business, every independent contractor, that’s a worker owned business in diguise. Sanders has courageously added to his platform modest
                incentives toward encouraging more worker run business. Although it is not the main plank, it is his only vestigial socialist measure, and it makes sense. Worker run small business is extremely innovative and more
                competitive than top-down impositions like franchises, or billionaire funded pet ventures.

                is harder, because it is dirt poor and has more ridiculous racial hangups. But Sanders will bring money in, simply by his minimum wage policy, let alone manufacturing and trade policy, and those racial hangups need to be
                retired for good. Upstate was a wealthy region when there was manufacturing, it can be wealthy again.

                Abhorrence of government black-ops and secrecy, whether in this country or abroad, whether from the left or the right, is a number one priority for the truther vote, and the truther vote is a contributor to the rise of
                outsider candidates. Truthers can support Paul or Trump or Sanders, because all three radiate honesty by having stood by extremely unpopular positions (although of course, Sanders aside, most of these positions are terribly
                misguided). They can’t easily support Clinton, Cruz, or Bush III, who will say whatever is necessary, including covering up government crime.

                To give you an example which is not controversial outside the US, In both the Democratic and Republican debate, you heard about “Assad using poison gas”, and “Obama standing down”, but you never hear why Obama stood down,
                despite the red-line regarding chemical weapons. The chemical attack was convincingly shown by international observers to have come from the rebels, not from Assad. It was a false-flag. Not that Assad is a good guy, but that
                atrocity was designed by the rebels, perhaps by the US, purposefully to drag the US into the war. You can’t allow such shenanigans, they need to be publicly exposed.

                As a leftist truther, I painfully toyed with supporting Paul, despite the gold-standard economic nonsense, and even for a day with Trump, only because he squarely blamed Bush II for 9/11 (although not in the usual way). I
                hope I don’t need to say that I don’t support Trump’s racist xenophobic nonsense, but honesty in government is simply that important right now. Truthers exist, and Sanders can win their vote, because he is honest. They are
                often Republicans, as the issue cuts squarely and evenly across party lines.

                I didn’t say the people will come, I don’t think that. I said Sanders supporters need to work hard to mobilize everyone. But Sanders supporters have a chance with a lot of people who are more disgruntled than you can ever
                imagine. The murder of 3000 citizens by the US itself is beyond intolerable, it is apocalyptic levels of corruption, and even well-meaning policy-pushing hoaxes like Sandy Hook are not acceptable in any way, and must be
                exposed.

                It’s NOT EASY, far from it! It requires a large motivated and readily mobilized national organization, which can pour financing, voter-turnout, and attention to individual states. But this is what Sanders is building, so it
                is POSSIBLE, just barely, but it requires a heck of a lot of work. When you improve Democratic and Sanders-supporting independent turnout by 50% in an off-year (when turnout is normally 40%, that means raising it to 60%
                among opponents), by mailing them regarding the importance of the election, by a serious get-out-the-vote operation, you can defeat a Republican in a supposedly safe district who normally has a safe 60% Republican majority.
                When you pour in television money for ads regarding issue vote, you can shift public opinion. This is why congressional candidates don’t like organized opposition, even minority opposition, like the AARP or NRA. Majority
                opposition, like a nationwide winning Sanders organization, is a non-negligible force, even in traditionally red districts.

                would recommend you go to Sanders’ website and get involved. I am not Bernie Sanders, and I don’t speak for him, I speak for myself, I am not a moderate. His positions are more popular and moderate than mine.

                A huge majority (like 80%) of Americans are skeptical of one or another aspect of the official story, and a large minority (including many Republicans) believes the attack was entirely staged by people inside the Bush
                administration for their own interest. I am one of those people, I am personally certain, because of the drills of that day. The Vice President was in charge of a set of simultaneous once-in-a-lifetime military drills on
                that morning, drills simulating simultaneous hijacking on radar screens, simulating crashing airplanes into buildings, live-fly exercizes involving many air-force planes, which can easily be manipulated to stage the attack,
                and are inexplicable otherwise. I am not sure that anyone in the Bush administration other than the Vice President knew anything about it, before or after, but I’m sure they suspected. Maybe they knew.

                Let them try to smear him on it. They can’t, they already try. He is a very principled guy. He has managed to overcome his Democratic Socialist label in the most conservative era in American history. His health care plan is
                not disruptive relative to the ACA, it would be more disruptive compared to the situation before ACA, and similar plans passed in every other industrialized country in the 1940s and 1950s.

                There are really only a handful of credit card companies, nearly all under the duopoly umbrella of Visa and Mastercard, and they made a deal in the mid 90s. I remember getting a letter saying the rate would rise to 20% (from
                around 12%) sometime in the mid to late 90s, after the consolidation of credit. Every card went to 20% at the same time, it was clear collusion, but nobody stepped in to sue. I closed my account, and I haven’t had a credit
                card since.

                The way they compete for business is by picking which pool to insure, and where to deny coverage, and how much they can increase copays and deductibles in a way that is invisible to consumers until they get sick. There is no
                real advantage to a health insurance market of this sort, that’s why the US has terrible health care. There is a good market for additional insurance for elective procedures in France, and for sure that would exist in the US
                just the same as in France.

                It depends on the TYPE of deregulation. Breaking up banks means smaller banks that lead to less regulation. Breaking up big companies means small companies that need less regulation. You need pro-competitive regulation, not
                Republican deregulation, which means letting businesses become monopolies without intervention.

                Ok, maybe, I was a toddler, but whatever people said, the Democrat in office didn’t listen. The Democrats passed sensible pro-market deregulation, when the Republicans say “deregulation” they just mean “let enormous
                companies do whatever they want and consolidate to monopolies”. The Airline deregulation involved infrastructure regulation, to ensure fair-competition in terminal pricing, just like communication deregulation. This
                Democratic model is the right path.

                That’s mostly true, but not entirely true. There is still venture capital, which is useful for new tech business, there is computerized stock trading which made the stock market more efficient, as opposed to microtrading,
                which is a form of fraud. It’s hard to regulate wall-street because investment is such a natural monopoly. I think Sanders has a sensible approach, and nobody else even comes close.

                You can’t tax all transactions to generate revenue for HEALTH CARE, because health care is enormous, like 20% of the economy or something. If you tax transactions that much, they just won’t happen, or will happen illegally,
                or through tricks, like exchanging private contracts instead of exchanging money and stock. The proper level of friction to add to a financial transaction is just the one that eliminates microtrading, and which generates
                just enough revenue to make public colleges tuition free. This is the responsible plan Sanders has proposed.

                They didn’t say the same thing about airlines. Airlines can’t be a Ponzi scheme, because you see the airplane take you somewhere. Carter deregulated Airlines in 1978. Carter sued AT&amp;T to break it up in 1979, Clinton
                introduced deregulation measures for competition in the telecommunication sector, which led to small ISPs and tiny phone companies, and reduced prices. The Republicans do not enforce pro-competition policy anymore, they
                haven’t for decades. Sanders is the one pushing for pro-competition measures, including breaking up the banks.

                If insurance companies could compete across state lines, the consolidation would get worse. You can open up your own Facebook tommorrow, that’s not the reason for consolidation. Consolidation is actively encouraged by

                This is because Obama did not use his grassroots organization for opposing the opposition, but only to get himself elected. The policies were done in the usual negotiated fasion, without any repercussions for opposition.
                Bernie Sanders has made it a central pledge of his campaign that he will not repeat that mistake. Also his organization is quite a bit better than Obama’s, because we’ve had 8 years to improve internet organizing, and the
                base is much bigger now than 8 years ago.

                That’s not how it works. When you have a grassroots organization with funding and motivation, you can target the opposition one by one if they oppose your policies. Any Republican who opposes will be primaried or challenged,
                and will face a strong fundraising and organizational advantage, as he will be against a national juggernaut. Sanders is winning by assembling this coalition, he got zero media attention to get to where he got now, it was
                all internet grassroots.

                To pass this plan, you need a grassroots organization like the one Bernie Sanders is building throughout the country. The people who support him don’t do so because they think his glasses are cool, they support his policies,
                and they can work against the reelection of Republicans who oppose by primarying other Republicans who support the policies, or by voting in Democrats.

                He’s not based on “turning out the vote” in any traditional sense, at least not any pre-existing vote, that doesn’t work. He’s based on honesty, and on a different set of policies which are extremely popular. People who
                support his policies and demeanor often simply do not vote, or often register as independent, either from the right or the left. He ran as an independent until now for a reason.
            </p>
            <p>
                What that means is that his voter coalition is highly motivated, and includes a ton of independents, some Republicans, and people who do not normally vote. That’s similar to Reagan siphoning off disillusioned Democrats in
                the 80s, and it’s the way in which political transformations happen— once you have a grassroots base, you can get things done. You can’t get anything done otherwise, except by lying to constituents.

                staging 9/11. Any Republican down with 9/11 truth can only support candidates like Paul, Ventura, or Trump, which I believe explains some of Trump’s popularity.

                not comparing to St. Peter or to an omniscient being, I’m comparing to other politicians. He did the right thing on something that wasn’t on his list of issues when he started, and you don’t find that kind of responsiveness

                This is not a legitimate criticism. That is an extremely uncharitable interpretation of what he said off the cuff when he was first interrupted, before he had a chance to consult his people and make a decision on policy. He
                just said those things which were part of his platform already, and which were somehow remotely relevant, he didn’t suddenly make up new policy on the spot (nor should he).
            </p>
            <p>
                But nothing in his then current platform was enough, and he knew it. So as soon as the issue was pointed out, he respectfully addressed the issue within a week or two, without pandering, sincerely, by a direct hire of the
                other Sanders, the BLM leader, and by a comprehensive racial justice and policing platform, which became a mainstay of his campaign. He got Cornel West on board, despite his previous concern that Sanders is insufficiently

                The changes in the last 20 years are enormous, and far too fast to have anything to do with “little ice age” nonsense (which isn’t even true). The models are not so accurate, they never were, they don’t need to be, because
                we did the experiment. The prediction of warming is not based on the models, it is based on a simple mechanism— each molecule of CO2 in the atmosphere increases temperature by a certain amount, just by increasing infrared
                light scattering. The uncertainty is how much water vapor is evaporated in a hotter atmosphere, and we don’t know for sure. But it DOESN’T MATTER, as we know that each molecule of CO2 will warm the world more, and even the
                current warming is unacceptable, let alone in 50 years where there will be twice as much human CO2.

                competent they are going to be, it’s a mystery. When the candidates deliver policy papers, you know they didn’t write them by themselves, their staff did, which means you get to see how competent their eventual appointees

                discussion, linked under another comment of mine. I still think that his support comes from small business and private farmers, not from any big business ties. That’s the only way I can make sense of his popularity among
                Republicans. I stand by it, although I cannot support it with data, I believe it is true regardless.

            <p>Sanders would trounce any Republican by wider margins than Clinton would. Nader was a third party.</p>
            <p>
                You underestimate the dislike of Clinton among Republicans. They believe that she manipulated the Benghazi attack for political gain, by claiming a video was responsible, when she knew this was false. At the time, she also
                advocated for internet censorship because of that video, which has nothing to do with any attack on Benghazi, but rather constitutes an attack on the first amendment, probably insincere, but that’s even worse.
            </p>
            <p>
                She attacks the second amendment with her support of lawsuits, Sanders has been vocal in protecting the right of small gun-shops owners from lawsuits. She attacks the fourth and fifth amendment by supporting the Patriot act
                and invasive government warrantless snooping (at least when it was popular). These measures are really, really disturbing to Republicans, especially to those who supported Ron Paul, and really, the bill of rights should not
                be up for debate at all on either side.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding pandering, Clinton recently talked about UFOs and space aliens. Does that mean she believes aliens came down in flying saucers to visit farmers? Of course not! She is pandering for the UFO believing vote, who are
                the only people who pay attention to such pronouncements. This kind of thing is just disheartening.
            </p>
            <p>
                She has claimed credit for killing Bin-Laden, which a lot of Republicans believe is a hoax (I don’t believe it either, and I’m not a Republican). I don’t want any more Bush-Cheney black-flag style nonsense, I want
                straightforward honest government, and many Republicans are willing to overlook liberalism on social issues for honest government that respects the constitution and doesn’t pander or lie to voters for political gain.

                Hillary’s Republican supporters are supporting her because of her hawkish war stances, and her support for big corporate interests. It is clear that Sanders’ Republican support comes from small business which knows that he
                is on their side.

                I am not in VT, but I think that when a politician gets significant Republican support, people know that he is sincerely supporting small local business against large corporations, and local property owners who are oppressed
                by regulations. I mean, how else could he do it?
            </p>
            <p>
                I think it is clear that Sanders listens, just from his outstanding response to BLM, that’s an issue that didn’t come from Vermont. I think the credibility is transferable, because he has delivered on all his campaign
                promises, including ones that the media said he would break until the day he kept them, like releasing his detailed tax and health care plan, as described in the article, a plan which involves no pandering and is much more
                sensible than I expected.

                Sanders is not counting on a bully pulpit, he is counting on an organization which is sprouting behind him, and dedicated to his issues. The amount of mobilization for get-out-the-vote, fundraising, canvassing, and political
                action dwarfs what Obama set up in 2008, it’s all online, it’s all ordinary people, and Sanders is committed to using the grassroots to drive the change he wants to see, rather than shelving it and using it only for
                re-election, as Obama did. This means he can’t let down the base, as he is counting on their continued support, and the base can’t let him down, as they are the only method of getting reforms through.
            </p>
            <p>
                With an organized movement, Congress members are not going to automatically oppose your suggestions, as you can organize against their re-election. Congress folks take organized opposition seriously, and will compromise with
                or capitulate to a powerful grassroots movement, in a way that they will not to an isolated president.

                I believe he is moderate on this issue, and I am a very anti-gun person on principle. Republicans vote for Sanders every election, he gets 25% of the Republican vote, and sweeps Independents and Democrats. The reason is that
                he is sensible where it counts, and Republicans may not agree with him on all issues, but they know they can trust him.
            </p>
            <p>I don’t feel I can trust the leaders of the Democratic party all that much, and I am certain I can’t trust the leaders of the Republican party. I feel one can trust Bernie Sanders not to deceive the public.</p>

                I believe it could be a 60/40 landslide, due to the support he gets from disenfranchised voters, but it could also be a 55/45 election, and still get results afterwards. The reason is that there is an unbelievably organized
                political movement sprouting up to get him elected, and unlike Obama, he doesn’t plan on shelving this movement, but using it for real electoral clout. The movement is here for the long term, not for a single person, but for
                the issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                The canvassing, volunteering, fund-raising, and get-out-the-vote operations for Sanders are superb, they are 50 state operations, and they can be mobilized for or against any individual congressional candidate. Such
                grassroots movements are real political power, and they can persuade a senator or congressman to vote against big-money interests. Congressional leaders are cautious about organized opposition, much more than individual
                isolated opposition.
            </p>
            <p>
                All this is the third iteration of the internet-based political organization ideas which started with Dean, progressed through Obama, and now are lining up behind Sanders. The internet folks know they have a new political
                tool, and it can be used to counteract the gridlock in congress, and provide solid support for policies, as long as they have solidly strong majority public support, as Sanders policies invariably do.

                If Sanders is elected, it means the turnout is sufficiently motivated to ensure that there will be no fight necessary. Anyone who doesn’t support it will have an army of Bernie supporters getting out the vote to make sure
                they are out of office next time around.

                Bernie Sanders’ more moderate gun stance is part of the reason he is so much stronger in the general election as compared to Hillary, and part of the reason why he polls so well with independents. It is reasonable to
                compromise on guns with common sense restrictions rather than abolition, if the goal is breaking up banks and restoring confidence in public institutions. Consider that many American voters believe that Democrats are
                conspiring to eliminate guns, using frivolous lawsuits and photo-op-ready mass shootings. I don’t think any voter believes that Sanders would deceive the public to push any policy goal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sanders is running with a plausible claim to support the entire bill of rights, and like it or not, the second amendment is there. It is a freedom that is provided. I expect politicians to do the maximum sensible thing
                within this framework, not to look for dirty tricks to work around it.

                Keynsian economics does draw a line— the line is when serious inflation starts. That line is nowhere near today, and it isn’t clear it would have been there in the 70s either, if Keynsian policies had been handled more
                sensibly by Nixon than dumping millions into war spending.
            </p>
            <p>
                Carter’s monetary policy was Keynesian in theory, but it was austerity in practice. The goal was to eliminate inflation, and Volker did that, and Volker was a Carter appointee. Carter inherited the post-Vietnam inflation and
                unemployment, and fixed it with very tough policies that led to him losing his job.
            </p>
            <p>I am happy you are a logical positivist, me too. I would ask you to look at the theoretical predictions of Keynesian and Chicago school economics, that’s what empiricism is all about:</p>
            <p>Chicago school predicts that a three-fold expansion in money supply leads to a three-fold increase in prices relatively quickly, as the money starts to percolate around the economy.</p>
            <p>Keynesian theory predicts that a three-fold expansion of the money supply does very little to inflation, in cases where the money isn’t in the hands of workers, and industrial capacity isn’t stretched.</p>
            <p>We had the Obama stimulus in 2009, and all the Chicago school folks predicted a tripling in prices. The Keynesians predicted inflation as usual. I will let you check which prediction is closer to the truth.</p>
            <p>
                The Chicago school predicts job-losses in response to minimum wage increases. This is completely intuitive, and doesn’t need explanation. The Keynesians COUNTERINTUITIVELY predict job gains, after a readjustment, due to
                increased spending. There have been a dozen or so minimum wage hikes, and the results are uniformly in line with Keyensian predictions. When you make the minimum wage too high, the result is inflation to restore it to
                equilibrium value, but that has never happened in any economy. Again, the Chicago school is dead wrong, and this is a quantitative test. I will let you look at employment and mean income statistics for Australia, where the
                minimum wage is the equivalent of $15 American an hour, Sanders preferred minimum wage.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Chicago school also has a counterintuitive prediction— that reducing taxes can increase government revenue through extra growth. This prediction can be statistically tested, it is completely false regarding growth— the
                correlation between tax rates and growth is all over the place, but slightly positive, not negative. Further, the reduction of deficits is magical thinking, it is both counterintuitive and wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                I agree that the Republicans were slightly more Keynesian than the Democrats back in the 1960s and 1970s, but they didn’t really understand the deep theory behind it. They just went by the nonsense in mainstream economics
                books, about some kind of magical trade-off between unemployment and inflation. They therefore believed you couldn’t have unemployment and inflation at the same time, and when that happened in the mid to late 70s, they
                though ‘whoa, this disproved Keynesianism’.
            </p>
            <p>
                The deep theory behind Keynes is really fundamentally Marxist. If you actually are a former Marxist, you should understand that Marx predicts that wage labor goes to subsistence in an industrialized economy, while Chicago
                school economists predict that wage labor goes to the mean productivity per employee. I’ll let you check which prediction is more accurate in economies with wage labor and no regulations. There is always unemployment which
                drives the price of wage-labor to subsistence, regardless of productivity per employee.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason unemployment and inflation are in some sense opposite is because of the effect of raising wages. When you raise wages, you can either get closer to equilibrium, in which case you don’t get inflation and instead
                you get more production. Or else you get inflation to bring you back to equilibrium, when you are already at full employment. But this is dependent on there being enough capital and innovation in the investment sector to
                create enough new business to absorb the labor. In the 1970s, investment was too difficult, and this was understood by both the left and the right.
            </p>
            <p>
                The right decided to do something about it. This is what the ‘get the government off our backs’ philosophy was all about— people needed to be free to start new business, and removing regulations and increasing available
                capital does that, by any means. The means chosen by the Republicans was to allow concentrations of capital by reducing income tax rates, and allowing deregulated corporate mergers, and a laissez-faire policy. This does
                increase the availability of investment capital, so it is in some sense an appropriate response to a situation where there is no capital for investment. That’s the extent to which I can say anything good about it, it’s a
                catastrophic policy for workers, and it’s a catastrophic policy for stable economic growth.
            </p>
            <p>These ideas led to the kind of ridiculous pure-capital growth that you saw in the last 40 years, and to mergers and acquisitions that monopolized all American businesses, and destroyed the small business economy.</p>
            <p>
                Your ideas about the USSR are derived from right-wing propaganda. It was not a good system, but the way it acheived 0% unemployment was not through any kind of slave labor. It just made it easy to get a job, and adjusted
                wage incentives to get the right number of people into the right position. That’s about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The situation at zero unemployment was very funny. A factory worker could make more than a manager, because many people were qualified and wanted the manager job, and nobody wanted the factory worker job. This is what a lot
                of people were grumbling about— the highest paid positions were often just bad jobs that nobody wanted, so they needed a high pay incentive to fill the slots.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is exactly what is predicted by capitalist theory, paradoxically enough, at zero unemployment. This phenomenon has not been observed outside of communist countries, only because the unemployment has never been zero
                anywhere else.
            </p>
            <p>There is no comparable free-market example, not in Israel, and not in Switzerland. Unemployment has never been eliminated entirely in non-communist states. So it’s difficult to look at any other example.</p>
            <p>
                Regarding your own personal evolution, it is influenced by your class status and the ideas of those around you. I read a ton of conservative thought, and I briefly rejected the left and became a free-market guy, when I
                understood the bureaucratic problems in the government and large organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the solution to both government and big bureaucracy is to reduce both the government and big business, and this is done by non-regulatory policies that provide incentives to distribute power. Incentives for breaking
                companies up by a progressive corporate income tax, and incentives for worker control by tax breaks. Together with a reasonably high minimum wage, and jobs programs to absorb excess labor, that’s enough to push the
                capitalist economy to full employment, and at full employment, wages are basically the same is in the USSR, excluding investment income.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your delusion about the abilities of people are belied by real life. To make your wage go to the mean, you don’t need everyone to be equal, you just need another person to compete with you for the job. That means just a few
                more people who can do what you are doing, not everybody.
            </p>
            <p>
                Investment is not really done by the individual investor, but by a cloud of advisors and professionals. The talent or lack thereof of the individual is not so important, as you can always find investment advice when you need
                it, and conservative investments like index funds are not much worse on average than risky investments.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way great fortunes are made is not by investment so much, as by monopoly from an IPO, or by investing OTHER PEOPLE’S MONEY, like Warren Buffet. Investment is a natural monopoly, because there are fluctuations, so an
                investor who outperforms the market in one year suddenly becomes a “guru” and attracts more investment. The best investors and mediocre investors are not that different in skill, and typical investors are stupid enough to
                believe in magical fairy-dust like chart-analysis and other voodoo. It doesn’t mean they lose money due to their false beliefs, because capital in a time of growth tends to grow. Lets just say that investment is not done by
                scientists.
            </p>
            <p>
                What is most important for investors is their politics and class. A wealthy person navigating in the investment world MUST adopt the customs and manners of the upper class, as a bohemian would get kicked out of any position
                in a capitalist economy. Steve Jobs, for example, was kicked out, as the founder of Men’s Wearhouse was kicked out of the company he founded. Entrepreneurs are generally different people than investors, they actually have
                ideas, and they are sometimes not of the proper social class. So the investors replace them with their own, a fellow like Scully. Someone conservative looking and reassuring, regardless of vision or ability.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have no real reason to speak to you, as I think if you still accept anything Chicago school as anything other than a self-serving fantasy you are either delusional or haven’t been looking at data. There is no real academic
                value to any economic theory from the right since Marx, and that’s a long time.

                I believe there is a limiting being, conscious in a precise sense of computing outcomes of ethical questions, and self aware in the precise sense of being self-reflexive, i.e. computing about questions involving itself,
                existing outside of space and time, which is progressively more perfectly manifested over time, through the collective evolution of human societies over time, and also manifested in nature, through the evolution of biology,
                and therefore in this precise sense sustaining all life, although I wouldn’t use the verb “sustaining”, as it is basically so vague as to be meaningless to me. Unfortunately, “creation of the universe/life” and “sustaining
                the universe” are even more meaningless to me, as I am a logical positivist. I don’t know what this means, so I can agree with you or disagree, as I feel I am saying nothing either way.

                anything, and I’m a positivist, so most traditional formulations of the question are meaningless to my ears.

                I don’t believe in magic or miracles. But I do believe there is a limiting endpoint to asymmetric superrationality in large systems, to be precise about it, and I also suspect that this is also what most people mean when
                they say the words “I believe in God”. So, basically, without the long song and dance, yes.

                My defense is that Marx was writing correct things. Marx wasn’t writing about Marxism, he was writing about capitalism. There were no socialist economies in his time, he had no experience. His analysis was of wages and
                aggregate demand in capitalist economies, it’s now subsumed into mainstream economic thought. His suggested policies in the “Communist Manifesto” are an outgrowth of that, and are not really radical today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern Marxism, in the sense of completely state-controlled economies, begins with Lenin, and really only seriously starts with Stalin and the first five year plan in 1930. What Marx wrote is not relevant to that so much, as
                Marx was writing a correct analysis of capitalism. He wasn’t writing about socialist economics.
            </p>
            <p>
                His ideas are now a foundational part of what is called “Keynesianism”, and are mainstream economics. The idea that Marx is writing something controversial is ridiculous, it’s done by people who haven’t read any Marx or any
                subsequent economics, and think that reading the name on the title page is enough to know what it’s about.

                Global warming predicts that 2016 will be warmer than 1990, and roughly the same as 2010-2015, despite the fact that 2015 was not only anomalously warm, it was the warmest year on record. We’ll measure next year, but you
                don’t need to measure, it will be. These predictions have been uniformly correct since around 1995, despite the fact that the average temperature is so warm now, that to call it a statistical fluctuation is insane.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way CO2 warms the atmosphere is by scattering infrared light. This makes a greenhouse, as the sunlight can get in, and the infrared light takes longer to get out. That’s why “global warming” was initially called “the
                greenhouse effect” when it was first predicted in 1970. The predicted warming wasn’t measurable until the 1990s.
            </p>
            <p>The effect is known, the cause is known, and you can verify the science by yourself on the back of an envelope, you don’t need to trust experts. The denials are simply a form of mental disability.</p>

                The conditions don’t have to be exactly the same twice, economics still makes predictions on the margin— you do this, then that happens. You can test it by doing it again, undoing it, doing it later. The recurrent minimum
                wage hikes, and the recurrent stimulus, the recurring tax cuts and tax rises, that’s what makes these predictions easy to check. If you predict that that government deficits will fall when taxes go down, and you cut taxes
                several times, and the deficits go up, again and again (as they did under Reagan and Bush), enough, it’s a false prediction. It’s just wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a conservative “supply side” counterpart to the counterintuitive prediction that when you raise minimum wage unemployment can go DOWN, and usually does. This prediction is made by Keynesians, and unlike the supply
                side prediction, it is routinely observed real-world when minimum wage is increased.
            </p>
            <p>This is very strange, and it requires a theoretical understanding. I will explain it correctly below.</p>
            <p>
                The basic prediction fundamental to Marxist economics is that in an industrial economy with unemployment and no minimum wage, workers will be making subsistence wages. This is from classical supply and demand— when the
                supply exceeds the demand, the price for the product drops to the cost for maintain it. This was verified by Marx in England in the 1850s, in Capital, with a comparison of wage labor return for the 12 hour work day and daily
                cost of living (they were roughly equal). It is verified again in economies like those of South America, where there are underclasses who are chronically unemployed, and earn subsistence wage.
            </p>
            <p>
                The low wages means that there is no laborer who can buy the products of the industrial economy, and the demand in the economy is confined to a small class of people who are able to somehow get industrial profits into their
                pockets, this is the owner class and their lackeys, who survive on services of the owner class. When you have this situation, and you don’t do anything, unemployment will skyrocket, due to the feedback between plummeting
                demand, closing factories, rising unemployment, and further falling demand. This is a description of the great depression, and of those same South American economies in their normal state.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is not anything like a free-market equilibrium, which is a situation where everyone is making roughly the same amount of money. In free market theory, if you’re making more money than me, I just go and do what you’re
                doing, until the wages equalize due to supply and demand. Of course this doesn’t work in real life, but in theory, that’s what supposed to happen. In this equilibrium, there is zero unemployment, all wages reflect
                productivity of labor, and everyone is making roughly the same amount, up to small differences regarding efficiency of labor, risk, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>When you introduce minimum wage, you raise consumption, and you also increase the price of labor. One effect wants to make the unemployment go down, the other wants to make the unemployment go up. Which dominates?</p>
            <p>
                The Keynsian theory says this— when you are getting closer to equilibrium, the unemployment goes down. When you are getting further from equilibirum, inflation kicks in to bring you back. This predicts that when the minimum
                wage is far below the productivity per employee, you get a greater spur due to consumption increase than a drop due to the higher price of labor. This prediction has been tested more than a dozen times in the US alone when
                minimum wage went up, and it is uniformly correct. The change in employment in response to the rise is zero, often negative, and never the marginal amount predicted by supply-siders, who only consider the second effect and
                not the first, which more than compensates.
            </p>
            <p>
                You don’t get to make up economic facts. You think you do, because economics is a politicized field. These things are understood theoretically, and verified empirically. It doesn’t matter that it’s more difficult to do
                experiments, you still do them, and the outcome matters.

                Because he lies about the number of people killed there! I don’t need to be in the gulag— his numbers are absurd. Sixty million victims is simply impossible, with the WWII deaths, it’s more than half the Soviet population
                dead! Even his earlier twenty million number is inconsistent with historians, inconsistent with common sense, and inconsistent with asking a random sample of Russians about the period. These numbers are simply lies.

                I don’t blame him so much. He was really a prisoner, he was really abused, and he didn’t lie so much early on— A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich is a great book. He was a brave dissident to begin with. The lying came
                later, as he decided the true suffering he described was not enough, and he needed to make additional propaganda to oppose the system he detested, as if the truth weren’t bad enough.

                The same happened with Jewish holocaust victims. The accounts in 1946 and 1950s, and into 1961 with the Eichmann trial are all consistent with each other, very authentic, and consistent with guard testimony, and documents.
                But if you look at the much later 1988 Demyanjuk trial in Israel, a trial many decades removed from the events, the testimony for the first time included absurd fabricated claims of atrocities that one can see did not occur,
                as they were not documented earlier and are inconsistent with timely camp accounts. Former prisoners described the Gestapo cooking babies on stoves, made up nonsense like this. It’s the same effect— the emotional impact of
                the cold truth about the mass murder is too low, it doesn’t get the horror across, so people resort to fictional narratives that attempt at a greater emotional truth. But if you are a scientist, these fictional narratives
                are simply lies, and cold honest narratives (like Ivan Denisovich) are all that are needed.

                Keynesian economics is transparently obvious to any Marx reader. It looks like bunk if you are trained in pre-Marx economics, because Keynes was working hard to remove his dependence on Marx, and made up some nonsense to

                triple under Obama’s stimulus and so on, and predict a rise of unemployment every time minimum wage is raised, a rise which never comes. You see, when you consistently make wrong quantitative predictions, your theory is

                No, no. The predictions on inflation response, on response of unemployment to minimum wage, these were all made in advance, and uniformly work. They are used predictively to set monetary policy to control inflation— this was
                the innovation of the 1970s and 1980s, learning how to fix inflation by money supply tricks. These are all Keynsian policies, and there is no alternative. Everything else is bunk. It’s not opinion, you see.

            <p>I know exactly why the capitalist West outstripped the communist East, and now the West is destroying that feature.</p>
            <p>
                The communist East was run as one gigantic mega-corporation, it did not have the diversity of small business. The reason they developed this way, into gigantic state-controlled monopolies, is because this is what Marx
                predicted would happen to Capitalism eventually— all the corporations would merge into mega-corporations, and then the state would take them over. Marx genuinely assumed this was an efficient situation, except for macro
                issues relating to low worker pay. Then he predicted the state would take over the mega-corporations after the workers revolted due to low pay.
            </p>
            <p>The East just skipped the whole capitalism step and built the mega-corporations by the state. The result is the same as when a state takes over and nationalizes enterprises.</p>
            <p>
                The surprise is that mega corporations are simply NOT efficient! They are stagnant and bureaucratic, and cannot evolve further. When you only look at mega-corporations, then the East was completely competitive. The oil and
                energy industry was competitive (actually vastly superior in the East), the nuclear industry was competitive, steel, arms production, large 1960s and 1970s computers, etc.
            </p>
            <p>Where the East failed was in small business. That means, consumer goods, microcomputers. It wasn’t competitive in small businesses, because there was no small business.</p>
            <p>
                There was also NO INNOVATION in the big firms, they were frozen in time. The West had creaking innovation in large firms, due to competition. Where competition was absent, the innovation disappeared also, just like in the
                East.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lesson of the East-West divide is the lesson of the inefficiency of concentrations of business into monopolies, and the even worse inefficiency of making those businesses state owned monopolies. If they are private
                monopolies, there is at least a hope of a small competitor emerging.
            </p>
            <p>
                The West is now converting itself into mega-corporations, and destroying it’s one advantage. It is doing what Marx said it would do, instead of what all the reformers of the 20th century did, which prevented it from going in
                that terrible direction to monopoly and stasis, and innovation death.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point of Bernie Sanders is to reverse the concentration of power in large corporations. Teddy Roosevelt and Franklin Delano Roosevelt instituted policy to keep the corporate world from merging into oblivion, by
                anti-trust and taxation methods. But since Reagan, this has been abandoned. Now the US economy is looking more and more like the Soviet one, enormous state-level corporations producing everything in sight, completely
                resistant to both competition and change, just as inefficient, except privately owned with a class of managers and owners sucking profits into their pockets, and deforming the state to their ends by endless war and incipient
                fascism. That’s the worst of all worlds.

                I did the same thing with holocaust victims too. If you ask a Polish Jew what fraction of their relatives died, you can quickly get an estimate of the total scale of the events, even though there entire villages were

            <p>
                The correct figure is what historians in the 1980s came up with 1.5 million killed, and that’s already bad enough. Solzhenitsyn is a Nazi sympathizer, and didn’t like that Hitler had more concentration camp victims, so he
                just made the number bigger by making the number up. He didn’t have any quantitative training.

                The deaths under Stalin include a famine in 1932, which I cannot estimate reliably. Historians in the 1980s gave the figures I gave, more or less. The later numbers are by the same gang as the 20 million dead and 60 million
                dead, they are by numerically incompetent dissemblers.

                The way the number of people Stalin killed is calculated is by adding together all the people who were arrested and subsequently executed. This is the 1.5 million people I said. That amounts to “thousands and thousands of
                people” arrested, and many murdered— that’s the 1.5 million people.
            </p>
            <p>Solzhenitsyn, however, claims that it wasn’t 1.5 million killed, but 60 million.</p>
            <p>The population of the USSR in the 1930s was around 150 million. 60 million out of 150 million is 1 in 2.5.</p>
            <p>
                This means that, if Solzhenitsyn’s ridiculous claim is right, asking a Russian today about their family, statistically speaking, a grandparent would have been killed in the 1930s, two cousins, half their friends and
                acquaintances, and generally, something akin to the END OF THE WORLD, and a LIMITED NUCLEAR WAR. That’s 60 million victims.
            </p>
            <p>
                I asked a dozen Russians. Most knew relatives who were persecuted in some way, like a demotion, or a questioning, some sort of run-in with police. The arrests come at the “relative” level, and the political murders, when
                they do come, they come at the “distant acquaintance” level, meaning a co-worker of someone the grandfather knew was arrested, a distant cousin knew someone who was killed, etc. This is the typical level of homicide in the
                USSR under Stalin.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a statistical sample, but it easily disproved claims of 60 million dead, even 20 million dead, as both leave immediate signatures. The correct figure is 1.5 million dead, as responsible historians wrote in the late
                1980s and early 1990s, before the propaganda started.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also a famine, but I haven’t been able to sample it. It was localized to regions I couldn’t sample. I know it’s not propaganda, because Gorbachev suffered from it, and knew people who died, and also it was
                internally acknowledged and studied in the USSR, and the number of victims is roughly as I said it, with great uncertainty. The same goes for the famine in China. Famines are very hard to poll, and that famine was entirely
                discovered by demographic graphs showing a drop in population.
            </p>
            <p>
                I did the same thing with holocaust victims too. If you ask a Polish Jew what fraction of their relatives died, you can quickly get an estimate of the total scale of the events, even though there entire villages were
                systematically exterminated, and entire family. Similarly,<br />
                if you ask a Cambodian about the Khmer Rouge times (although I did not do this directly, as there are too few Cambodians for me to meet any). Likewise for the Rwandan genocide, or disappearances in South America, or Native
                American history, and so on.

                The imminent collapse of AIG was due to insurance hedging by Goldman Sachs and other banks, who bought credit default swaps on the bundled mortgages. The mortgages themselves are not an issue, the credit worthiness of the
                loans were not the issue, they could default or not. The big issue was that there was a CORRELATION between the loans that was not considered by the rating agency. If housing prices fell, all the loans would default at the
                same time. They ignored this correlation and treated the risk as statistically indepedent, to give AAA credit rating to these bundled loans based on the independent risk. This is credit-rating fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
                The credit-rating fraud made it that AIG couldn’t pay off the credit default swaps when they all came due. So they would go bust. And then those who held the credit default swaps would go bust too, because they had a bunch
                of these swaps, and so on. That’s the collapse.

            <p>
                The mortgages themselves a red-herring. They could have been anything else you can make a bet on, commodities, gold, whatever, just as long as there is correlated risk of drop in price, which is modelled as independent risk
                to make a risky investment look safe.

                The mass murder under stalin consists of 1.5 million or so prisoners killed for various political crimes. This is ATROCIOUS and UNBEARABLE enough without lying about it. The remainder of the “democide” consist of a 1932
                famine with an indeterminate number of victims, but since it was mostly in Ukraine and Ukraine still existed the next year, it’s less than half the Ukrainianian population (it’s much less). The estimates you read in history
                books are bunk, because they are made from demographic data which includes babies never concieved. The total deaths for Stalin is the 1.5 million plus 2-5 million famine deaths, and that’s if you think the famine is
                deliberate, rather than state stupidity. The same ridiculous demographic methods show you that 10,000,000 Americans were murdered during the great depression, and resuscitated as the baby boom.

                The same for Mao. The Chinese famine is state stupidity, and it killed an indeterminate number of Chinese people, about 20 million, maybe more, it’s hard to poll, because it’s elderly and children. That’s the “death rate of
                communism”, it’s really the “famine caused by collectivization programs”, and it’s something that has nothing to do with socialism, or even communism which doesn’t collectivize farms, like that in Cuba.

                The Khmer Rouge were not mainstream communists, and were replaced by the Vietnamese who were. The Ethiopian famine was linked to the Ethiopian Eritrean war of independence, and yet, propagandists add this up as “victims of
                communism”. Likewise for the Vietnam war and the war in Afghanistan and other rubbish. You might as well call the 4 million victims of the Irish Potato Famine victims of capitalism (which they were) or the indeterminate
                millions who died in the slave trade, or from homelessness, or lack of medical care, in the US, or from the wars of conquest of the 19th century, and the Native American genocide.

                lost in WWII. That’s like a limited nuclear war, and it’s disproved by simply asking a dozen Russians how many of their family died.

                I have been treated in Hong Kong for a stomach ailment, in Israel for various things, and I have some experience with healthcare in Europe. In Hong Kong, I was shocked, because it took about 20 minutes to see a doctor and
                get two good prescriptions, and it cost about as many dollars. I have never been to a country with a worse health care system than the US, I have been treated here (terribly) many times. For one of many examples: my daughter
                had croup when she was 2 (a common condition), and the treatment she received was substandard (they didn’t want to use steroids and gave her a bogus steam inhaler that did nothing), and, even worse, once she was diagnosed
                and treated, instead of being left alone to sleep, a parade of charlatans gave her a battery of unnecessary tests which were a total joke. I had to stop them when they decided to stick a tube down her throat with a “cease
                and desist” order! That was not because they were concerned about any medical anything. It was to make money from my daughter’s insurance.

                I have been to hospitals in the US many times, and seen the atrocious care— it really is the worst care in the entire industrialized world, by far. The private system encourages over-prescription of terrible drugs, including
                the antibiotic “Flagyl” which is extremely psychoactive and depresses and sedates patients. Doctors love it, because it shuts their patients up. The patients? Not so much. The same nonsense happens with over-prescription of
                anti-psychotics and anti-depressants, catastrophic over-diagnosis of nonexistent ailments, and ridiculous lack of preventative care.

                For another of countless examples, my father had a kidney transplant, and the doctors removed his kidneys. He then suddenly suffered from low blood pressure, and fainting spells. Eventually he had to SELF-DIAGNOSE Addison’s
                disease in himself, and tell the doctors that his adrenal gland was probably not working! He had to diagnose HIMSELF for the adrenal gland failure which should have been predictable, but THEY DIDN’T PREDICT IT. I can’t
                emphasize how shoddy it is in the US, it’s atrocious. And this was a top-of-the-line private hospital with way up there muckity muck surgeons.

                As for Keynsian economics, it predicted the inflation rate correctly in the US in 2009, 2010, 2011, and the quacks in the field didn’t. It also correctly predicts the counterintuitive response of unemployment to raise in
                minimum wage, a prediction which is the exact opposite of both Chicago school and common sense, and one that is confirmed each time the minimum wage goes up.

                The role of the government is to make sure that the market is operating at full employment, at maximum demand, and it hasn’t been doing this lately. This is well known, and accepted by both Democrats and Republicans from
                1940 until 1980. Nothing changed in the data since then, so nothing in my mind changed.

                I read a lot of Soviet stuff when I was a kid, because I was training to be a physicist, and half the good physicists were Soviet, and nearly all the good physicists before 1950s were fellow travellers (I toyed with
                communist ideology too before I grew up). I liked some Soviet literature immensely, and I studied the system for a bit in the late 80s, when I was in high school, because it was very topical then. Gorbachev had opened the
                system to criticism, and you could see exactly what was happening in state-farms and industries, and also what happened in Stalin’s time, openly, for the first time.

                I can say whatever I want regarding your mentality, I HAVE NO STATE POWER, and I don’t advocate anyone using state power (or any other kind of power) to put anyone else in a mental institution. The issue of power is
                paramount— people can call other people crazy, so long as they don’t impose their will on others. When you hand out state power you invite trouble.

                Bukharin and other early socialist anarchists had a lot to say about socialism and power, and in the end the failures of the USSR are failures of concentration of power more than failures of economics (although there was
                lots of that too). The same failure of power occurs when Western industry monopolizes, and power concentrates in a few hands, as it has today in the US. The key point is to reverse these concentrations of power WITHOUT
                increasing state power, and this is extremely tricky, but possible.

                The only brainwashing you got was by your terrible system, which gave you a post-traumatic stress regarding anything with “socialist” in it. Marx had important theoretical insights about Capitalism, and many of these were
                incorporated into capitalist economics by Keynes, and became the basis of standard economics. Marx wasn’t writing about communism, as there was no communism back then. These theoretical insights were denied by those on the
                right, and this leads them to wreck whole economies with oligarchic concentration of power, as the Soviet Union was wrecked in the 1990s, when the state privatized the national companies.

            <p>
                Your system was a state run monstrosity, a catastrophe. But the education and propaganda was not too terrible, because Marx was a pretty good academic. If you ignore dialectical materialism (which I don’t think anyone in the
                USSR took seriously anyway), you have JETP, Landau institute, really good academic work. You need to revisit what you learned in Soviet kindergarten, because it is an important truth, although not the only truth. It doesn’t
                matter that it was pushed by a failed totalitarian state with a hobbled non-innovative economy. The issues of innovation were due to centralization, which no one on the left supports, whether the concentration of power is in
                the government, or in large business.

                I KNOW who sold the mortgages. Selling them wasn’t the collapse. Rating the bundles wrong and insuring them under a false rating was the direct cause of the collapse, and not only that, this fraudulent practice is ALSO what
                led the demand for the mortgage bundles to skyrocket. The people taking the mortgage aren’t at fault, neither are the people issuing the mortgages. It’s the raters who rated the bundles, and those who raised demand due to
                the expectation of exploiting the misrating for profit. That’s the fraud. That’s the collapse. Everything else is peanuts.

                I do not support Nixon’s Keynsian policy, which included price controls and ridiculous hyperstimulus, and led to inflation. But I do support Carter’s economic policy, which was not exactly Keynsian, but austerity. His goal
                was to reduce inflation, and this goal was met in 1980s, due to the tight-money policies of Volker. The “malaise” of the 1970s is austerity, and it was needed due to the Vietnam war. Israel coincidentally went through a much
                worse period of hyperinflation due to the monetary policy instituted to pay for the 1973 war, and in that case, the socialist PM in the 80s, Peres, was also the austerity guy. The tough economic policies in both cases came
                from the left, because the left understands economics.

                Regarding employment in the USSR, anyone who was looking for a job could immediately find one. It wasn’t at full employment because of camps, it was at full employment because the incentive of managers was to maximize their
                labor pool, so they looked for ways to employ people. This is not to advocate for the Soviet system, it’s to point out what happens in a free labor market at zero unemployment. There are no standard examples of zero
                unemployment labor markets, but the USSR is a hidden example, because it had zero unemployment, and the state system of allocating wages was UNINTENTIONALLY producing the same results as a free market would. The reason is
                that labor was free to switch jobs, and the wages went up wherever there was scarcity of workers, and went down wherever there were too many, That’s the market mechanism. So if you want to see what wages look like in an
                equilibrium with no unemployment, there’s no other place to look. It would be nice to see the results in a capitalist economy with zero unemployment, but nobody has ever instituted such a successful jobs policy in any
                capitalist economy, so I’m stuck looking at a non-market example.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s not a good place to look at investment, because investment was not free market there. It also is not a perfect free market for labor, because mobility was restricted by internal passports and work permits, and there
                were population migration incentives, to get people to move to far-away places. But more or less it was close enough to see the rough outlines of an equilibrium wage structure, as I said, there’s no other example to look at.
            </p>
            <p>
                The investment by banks does not require rich people, and in capitalist equilibrium, investment is entirely done by banks, and not by any rich people, because there aren’t any rich people in equilibrium. The idea that rich
                people get rich through wise investment is belied by the dismal investment choices of rich people, like every billionaire out there, who get wealthy through a market mechanism that involves wall street IPO attempting a
                monopoly. There is no productive investment from any of these people.

            <p>The selling and “repackaging” of the loans wasn’t a big deal, the big deal was the false security provided by the bogus AAA credit rating, created fraudulently.</p>
            <p>
                If they had been rated properly as risky investments, with a comparable risk to housing prices falling, then the bad mortgages wouldn’t have been such a serious problem, it would have been isolated defaults. But then again,
                without the credit rating, the mortgages wouldn’t have been bundled in the first place, and there wouldn’t have been such pressure to issue as many as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t know how much of this coordinated fraud was done by the FM&amp;FM bosses, and how much by others, and honestly, I don’t give a flying fig. But I know where the fraud is— it is in giving these securities AAA. That
                creates an arbitrage opportunity, because it’s a lie— the bundles are not secure, and the risk is not properly hedged.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the lie is there, and once Goldman recognizes it’s a lie, it’s a short step from that to getting AIG insurance, passing off the loans, and pressuring banks to provide as many of these as they can, just to maximize
                profit. The whole thing is motivated by the desire to exploit a rating mistake rather than fix it. Since the rating itself is influenced by those who put it together for profit, it’s all fraud from beginning to end, and it
                has nothing to do with individual lenders, or with individual loans. It has to do with the bundlers and the ratings agency.

                You can’t snow me, I know what was going on. So does everyone else too, by the way. For another fraudulent deals, similarly due to insider knowledge and exploitation of risk to set a false price deliberately, see the lawsuit

            <p>
                There was a gigantic pyramid built on top of those mortgages, which required not only TARP, but also quantitative easing. The issue of fraud and collapse is due entirely to the fraudulent AAA rating from the credit agency,
                and the fraudulent exploitation of these ratings by Goldman Sachs and others. The collapse was not of F&amp;F, they are designed to take losses, it was of AIG, which isn’t, and everyone else by extension.

                When you have sex with a large number of women, you are in a bad position. Cosby’s case was specific allegations about drugs and rape, which were repeated in a pattern, and clearly credible. Clinton for sure had a ton of
                consensual sex, like a lot of people from his generation. He admitted to having “hundreds” of affairs at some point, and everyone was aware of it. When the Paula Jones thing became a scandal, there were a whole bunch of
                allegations, all of which didn’t pan out, except the Lewinsky business, which was clearly consensual. I figure if there was a good allegation, that was the time to hear about it. I didn’t hear anything about this in 1998,
                but I might not have been paying attention.

                obviously false one fabricated I remember from the 90s, which are nowhere near as believable as hers. Clinton had sex with thousands of women, it is not so hard to find someone to accuse him of wrongdoing, as a large
                fraction of them probably dislike him.

                are isolated, although disturbing. It is possible that there is nothing more interesting here than an atypically libidenous fellow, although it is possible that a crime was committed.

                It is possible to be a self-made billionaire, you can take over an industry by monopoly with help from wall street making you big early. Such is the case with Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Amazon, and other enormous firms
                with negligible competition. The competition cannot form, because it will get bought out. Those companies hold back innovation, as it is next to impossible to move such an enormous bureaucracy.

                The 400 Uber-wealthy people acquire their wealth by monopolizing an industry, and squeezing out thousands of smaller firms who make thousands of less wealthy but still wealthy people. The destruction of wealth due to capital
                concentration is real, and must be reversed. There is no competitive way to justify an individual making a billion dollars, it means a thousand other individuals aren’t making a million dollars competing with this person.

                Bill Gates took over and destroyed the entire software industry, through monopoly. His “innovation” was closing up software, and making the source code secret and private, something which had to be reversed by 20 years of
                effort by Richard Stallman, through the Gnu project, which gave you Linux. His wealth is classic robber-baron wealth, it comes at the expense of thousands of software developers, and it destroyed the whole software economy.

                I went to one of the most extremely conservative schools in the US for undergrad (Harvard), I then switched to the most liberal school I could find with a good physics program (still conservative Cornell), and watched it
                turn into a cesspool of nationalist conservatism and awful politicized science after 9/11/2001. I didn’t meet a single sincere feminist in either school, I never met a sincere Marxist aside from non-affiliated townies. So I
                was in complete contempt, and I hung out with borderline homeless people to feel comfortable.

                You haven’t “refuted” anything, you are just repeating neoliberal pap, with no understanding of the mathematical model it is based on. The mathematical model is a perfect competitive capitalist economy, where everyone is
                employed, the total wages are exactly sufficient to purchase all products, and the profits of any corporation goes to zero, and all salaries regress to the mean. This is the model in economics textbooks where the marginal
                analysis for economic peturbations that you are using is correct. It looks nothing like real industrial capitalist markets.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no such thing as a voluntarily unemployed person, or the unemployment in the USSR would not have been at 0%. There was not a single unemployed person there after the last unemployment office closed in the mid 1930s,
                not because of any regulation exactly, but because you could always go to nearly any construction site or shipyard and find a job due to the backlog of necessary work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main difference is that in the US, you need to find a job where you enrich a capitalist by selling your labor to this capitalist, either cheaply or dearly, and allow this capitalist to make a profit or to direct your
                efforts toward reinforcing the current system, and some people are not willing to do that, for example, myself. That’s not exactly voluntary unemployment, as one is extremely willing, desperate in fact, to work for the
                public interest.
            </p>
            <p>
                The statement that there is “unnatural involuntary unemployment” from minimum wage is presuming that in a full employment economy anyone would be willing to work for the current minimum wage. This is again belied by the
                Soviet labor statistics, which show that in full employment (Soviet states were the only states with 100% employment, but it was also briefly true in the US in the late 90s when unemployment dipped below 4%) NOBODY is
                willing to work for wages far below the mean, and employers MUST pay a higher wage simply to find an employee, as they did in the USSR. Under such conditions of low unemployment, all wages regress to the mean by competition,
                up to some discrepancies of up to a factor of 10 due to productivity. This is predicted by free-market doctrine, you just ignore the prediction because it is not true in US markets.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mean wage plus benefits of those making a wage in a small business is usually somewhat lower than that in a national chain, although the wage is usually not the big difference but the benefits. Comparing the employees to
                the employees ignores the fact that EVERY ONE of the ten thousand workers in a big store is an employee making a low wage, while out of five employees in a small business, three are OWNERS who aren’t making a meager wage,
                but what amounts to a good salary in the form of profit! The owners constitute a large fraction of the workers in a small business. The removal of owners making a reasonable income is the margin that the large store
                exploits. There are also health-care costs which are regressive for small businesses, and paperwork and regulation costs, which are regressive for businesses, larger businesses pay less per dollar. Then there is collusion in
                zoning with governments, and collusion in contracts with businesses, which can be fixed by having a pro-small-business government, and advertizing budgets, which brainwash consumers toward the large business. The advertizing
                propaganda can be fought with concerted public awareness projects, and directed consumer action to protect economic diversity, which is a version of ecology in the economic realm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Preserving small business is half-way to a worker owned economy, because small enough businesses are necessarily worker owned, as the owner and perhaps her family are the workers. To adjust the rest of the way to full
                employee ownership simply requires some incentive and public pressure, since every employee would like to work in a business where they have more say.

                There is no evidence that the mega-rich invest better than the moderately rich, or even better than the poor. Wealthy people acquire their wealth through a quirk of markets and political positioning, not through any
                difficult skill— nobody has to go to school for 8 years like a doctor or a physicist to become an investor.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have met with wealthy investors and VC professionals, and the VC professionals, while well-to-do, were much better at assessing profit potential. Angel investment is extremely psychotic, and goes to those who sell their
                pitch most slickly, including outright frauds. The influence of large billionaire investors has started to affect univesity funding, and their investments go to scientists. My brother is a professor at a school with a lot of
                private funding, and he has told me the things that billionaires fund, and knowing the science, they are completely ridiculous— they involve pet ideas the billionaire has which are absurd given the state of the literature,
                the billionaire has a big ego and no science training. This type of distortion leads funding to go to ego-driven projects with no chance of success, but is sometimes manipulated by crafty researchers to do a real project in
                secret among the bunk demanded by the billionaire.
            </p>
            <p>
                The professional investors are generally more sensible, which is why most people hire professional investors to manage their wealth. There is no real significant correlation between intelligence in investment and wealth—
                beyond the obvious one that a person who has no sense at all will lose their money. Investment is a natural monopoly, the person outperforming the market in any one year will have people flock to him as some sort of “guru”
                or “genius”, and this increases their wealth. Conservative investments usually do best, and risky investments which pay off the most due to risk, these are best done by either extremely wealthy people who can hedge with a
                lot of bets, or by similarly well capitalized VC firms or banks, and using the advice of experts in the field of the investment who are not particularly wealthy.

                Your hypotheses are simply false, and I can’t argue against them, because you are not listening to the data. There is data on unemployment response to minimum wage which contradicts your claims, and the predictions of
                Keynesians for the effect of stimulus have been confirmed in every stimulus since the 1930s, and are an economic fact.

                The government is not the best investment source, but it isn’t bad in several areas. It is the best for R&amp;D, and software is often much like R&amp;D, as it is a form of applied mathematics. It is the best at education,
                as even US private education lagged behind Soviet education. It is easy to see what the government is good at doing and what it is bad at doing, as we have had 70 years of completely government controlled economies, and they
                were only good at those things that the government is good at doing.

                My family came to the US and made some money, not a ton, but enough. My father didn’t manage to get any work in his field (electrical engineering), nor did my family ever make a large salary, my mother worked as a professor
                with a relatively low salary compared to the mean. But my family made some money due to coming in with some capital, buying a house in a neighborhood where property values went up, and switching houses frequently whenever
                there was a margin, including labor sunk at improving the property. This type of investment is what produces wealth at the local level, and it is valuable, but not really all that valuable. The houses were cookie-cutter
                suburban ones constructed of cheap materials, their rising value is and was a mystery to me, they are completely generic.
            </p>
            <p>
                This type of saving and investment is not affected by any macro policy. But don’t pretend that this is how enormous wealth is created. Enormous wealth is created by acquiring a monopoly in a field and charging people
                outrageous prices, as Gates, Musk, or Bezos did. It can also be done by having an enormous publically traded firm, and taking the profits into your pocket, as many high level managers do. All these practices are
                anti-competitive, and should not happen at all in economic equilibrium.

                The idea of a graduated corporate income tax, as a non-bureaucratic non-invasive mostly government-free substitute for the Sherman anti-trust act, which appears in my comments on this page, is (as far as I know) original to
                me. The idea of deep contract reform for uniform pricing and transparent corporate networks, as a nonuniform simple substitute for the monsterous uniform commercial code act of 1956, is also original to me. The idea of
                banning stock ownership by insiders in a publically traded corporation is original to me (and moots a lot of insider trading regulation), and the path to a non-governmental socialism (meaning 100% worker/public-stock owned
                business), enforced only by free worker and consumer choice without any governmental power, is also AFAIK original to me (although perhaps Murray Bookchin had similar ideas, I didn’t read him yet). These are the core of what
                I believe, they are not Sanders’ positions, or anyone else’s, with the possible exception of Bookchin, maybe Dilas, who I haven’t read.

                officials, who are the same gang from 9/11/73 were either behind the coup entirely, or at the very least wholeheartedly supporting it. I was around and following it closely, silly boy. I was in grad school, and into this

            <p>
                The point is that when there is a capitalist economy with large industrial firms, the unemployment drives wages FAR below equilibrium value, where the wages can purchase all production. This produces depression if not fixed.
                Any remedy that raises wages gets you closer to equilibrium. A minimum wage is an invasive regulation that does this, but providing jobs at a decent wage to anyone who asks does it structurally. I favor the latter remedy—
                that way, if someone is starting a new business, and people really want to join, there is no regulation on their wages, they can be paid next to nothing while the business gets on its feet.
            </p>
            <p>
                But a minimum wage is better than nothing, as in equilibrium, the minimum wage is roughly equal to the productivity per worker, and is also roughly the maximum wage, up to some corrections for risk and sporadic work. You
                can’t accept an economy that doesn’t look like classical free-market equilibrium.
            </p>
            <p>If a business can’t start at equilibrium, it shouldn’t start at all. It’s not efficient.</p>
            <p>
                Large businesses are extremely bureaucratic and inefficient, they are Soviet firms in essence. They drive their competitors out of business by lower labor costs (fixed by higher wages) and bad contracts (fixed by uniform
                pricing laws), and by dumping products at below-cost prices to drive competitors out (fixed by anti-trust lawsuits). There is no excuse for the destruction of American small business, you need an active government to protect
                small business. A small business is automatically an employee owned business.
            </p>
            <p>
                A larger business can be employee owned, if there are incentives for it. I don’t know if government incentives are the best for this, I think that employee pressure at full employment can make it that most businesses give
                their workers a fair say in the workplace. All the government has to do is keep unemployment at 0%, which it isn’t doing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point of economics is to approach that magical free market equilibrium by whatever method. In equilibrium, unemployment is 0%, all wages are roughly equal, and everyone purchases everything that can be produced. Leaving
                things alone is not a way, because industrialization and unemployment make it that equilibrium is unattainable.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you print money and distribute it to workers in a depressed economy, with idle manufacturing and unpurchased supply, you just do magic. It’s gain for nothing, as the supply is purchased, and the factories start up.
                People want to find something wrong with it, there is nothing wrong with it. It works because of what Marx explained— the economy is not at equilibrium, and printing money and distributing it to everyone gets you closer to
                equilibrium.
            </p>
            <p>
                This stops working when you get inflation, which is the basis for the tradeoff between unemployment and inflation in classical Keynesian theory. It is said differently in standard textbooks, because they strip out all the
                Marx.

                You can combine government efforts and individual choice by an interesting program— give people a tax refund on free software donations up to a certain value. This allows expanding the financing without destroying individual
                choice, and allows the public to become the distributor, rather than the government.
            </p>
            <p>Bernie Sanders has proposed this as a workaround for Citizens United— refund the first $100 of political donations every American makes. There are corruption issues with such things, but it is better than nothing.</p>

                This fraud led hundreds of people in large institutions to bet against the bundles, and when the bundles failed, the insurer (AIG) couldn’t pay out the insurance. That means it would collapse, and all those people would lose
                their insurance investment, which would lead them to collapse as well. All of this stuff is leveraged investment happening on top of the unproblematic mortgage business, and it wouldn’t matter if it were mortgages, stocks,
                or any other investment. If the ratings agency models the risk as independent when it is not, such a collapse can happen again.

                That’s right! You shouldn’t believe ANYONE, not me, and not him. You should look at the scientific evidence independently, and not trust experts. I recommend reading Gold’s book, and then reviewing the opposition’s case. To
                summarize one of the most conclusive points— oil is found with Helium contamination and Helium is produced through radioactive alpha decay. There is no radioactivity in life, but the mantle is full of Uranium and other alpha
                unstable elements. Likewise coal is full of Uranium Thorium, and other heavy elements which look like they percolated from the mantle in solution in methane.

                You have totally discredited sources. You don’t get to make up as many millions of murdered people as you like. Stalin repressed tens of millions, jailed millions, and killed a million and a half people on purpose, and
                another indeterminate number in a 1932 predictable famine. That’s bad enough as it is, you don’t get to make up numbers. Learn to do quantitative estimates, and ask some Russians questions. That’s what I had to do.

                Do you realize how many Russians died when Capitalism came? How many homeless people die each year? How many people die from lack of adequate health-care? Or poor capitalist nutrition? Talk sense, not propaganda. You don’t
                judge Capitalism by the Irish Potato Famine (which killed a huge fraction of the population of Ireland due to free-market British policies), you judge it by its most stable manifestation. There were no significant murders in
                the late USSR, it was crappy for other reasons.

                Not lies. Look at the death rates published by the historians that study the records, rather than by popularizers. The whole “Stalin killed 20 million people” thing is something Solzhenitsyn started to make a “Stalin is
                worse than Hitler” meme. The number of deaths under Stalin can be checked not only by records, but by asking Russians about their family history. The political murders happened at the “distant acquaintance” level, meaning, a
                colleague of a cousin was arrested. It was similar to the disappearances under Hussein or Pinochet. It was atrocious, I don’t know why you want to exaggerate it.

                Large corporations can afford to pay the higher wage, but it cuts into their margin over the small business. The small business gets more business when the minimum wage is higher, because the higher minimum wage raises
                prices at the big store more than it does at the small one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Big businesses have an average wage which is lower than the average wage in a small business, because the owner of a small business is usually making more than minimum wage to justify the effort and risk. So all in all,
                higher minimum wages benefit small businesses, even though the businesses don’t realize this, as they only see the local payroll expenses. So it’s difficult to explain to a business owner, but after the minimum wage rises,
                and they make more money, and suddenly can compete with WalMart successfully, they’ll get it.
            </p>
            <p>
                You’re right that higher minimum wage leads to more automation, but anyone doing a job that can be automated is in a miserable job, and should be doing something else anyway. That’s what retraining and college are for, to
                put you in a place where you can use your brain.

                Your criticism of Keynes is off the mark— he wanted full employment by any means, he was joking when he said you bury money in the ground. The full employment is what is needed to get the market working at close to full
                capacity, and when there is unemployment, you need minimum wage, unemployment insurance, and jobs programs to make sure it doesn’t kill wages. That’s all there is to Keynsianism— guaranteeing employment, and it can be done
                more easily with a permanent jobs program, as Martin Luther King proposed, than with half-hearted interventions.

                Regarding software, you haven’t noticed that all the best software of the past decade is free software. Companies can’t write software well. The reason public investment in software can work is because you can make

                There were about 1.5 million murdered under Stalin, negligible number of murders in China— it wasn’t the same exactly in China, the repression was by job-loss and “reeducation” rather than by murder. There were famine deaths
                in collectivization pushes, in 1932 some 2-5 million (I can’t estimate reliably) in the USSR, and in the great leap forward collectivization, some 5-20 million in China, can’t estimate either. The bogus estimates you read
                are purposely skewed by including diminished birth-rates in famines as deaths, or sometimes by just making big numbers up. The same methods would lead you to conclude that 10 million Americans were murdered during the great
                depression, and were miraculously resuscitated in the baby boom.

                Ask a Russian how many relatives are dead. It is easy to detect 30 million dead by statistical sampling, that’s like a limited nuclear war. The true figure is around a million and a half murders under Stalin, or at most
                twice that (from adding together execution figures and camp deaths), and an unknown number of famine deaths in 1932, perhaps around 3-5 million, it is not clear, because there are political writers like Solzhenitsyn doing
                whatever they can to raise the number, and famines are really hard to poll because they kill the elderly and young children first, and the Soviets covered it up until the 50s, and then again until the 80s.

                The Soviet Union did not fail on death rate either, if you accumulate the total deaths from homelessness and lack of health-care in the West during the Soviet period, it is comparable, but somewhat larger. The USSR failed on
                innovation and freedom, and ONLY on those points. But these are the most important points.

                Of course it failed! You have to understand EXACTLY WHY AND HOW it failed to know how to move forward. It did NOT fail on prices, it did NOT fail on industrial integration, it did NOT fail on wages, and it did not fail on
                heavy industry. It simply did not fail on economic calculation, it suprisingly SUCCEEDED in economic calculation, which is why people were buying into it in the 1930s, 40s, and 50s.
            </p>
            <p>
                I should point out the insane levels of efficiency in the calculation as follows: the USSR industrialized from 1931-1941 (the first two five year plans) mostly in the region closer to Europe. It then was invaded by the
                Germans, and the significant heavy-industry plants were closed and moved to Siberia, effectively rebuilding the whole infrastructure a second time, in a few months after the German invasion, where the Russians out-produced
                Germany in tanks and planes in 1943 and 1944, even though at that time the German Reich was larger in resources and manpower. This required the same economic calculation as the entire US arms industry in the same period, and
                the whole industry was built from scratch.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was simply no failure of calculation in the USSR. It just didn’t happen. The system failed on innovation and initiative, and on consumer goods, which require a lot of decentralized businesses, not to mention the
                totalitarianism and repression, and total slavery.
            </p>
            <p>
                Knowing the failure mode lets you identify it when it happens in the West. It happens in large Western business almost the same way— they are nearly as resistant to change as Soviet firms were, for essentially the same
                reason, ossified power structures and bureaucracies.

            <p>Oh God, do I have to go through it again? Mises predicted several things, most of which were nonsense.</p>
            <p>1. He predicted that it would be a problem to set prices in the command economy.</p>
            <p>
                There are millions of products in the economy, and you need to set a rational price for all of them centrally, how do you do that? Mises said it would be impossible for planners to do it, and the prices would be out of whack
                permanently.
            </p>
            <p>
                This prediction was simply false, and demonstrated to be false in 1936 with the success of the first five year plan, and the period of Soviet growth. It was simply not difficult to set prices at all. The way it was done was
                by mandating general pricing principles, like cost of production + capital depreciation, and letting local managers figure out what it should be for their plant. Then the reports would come back up to the party, and they
                would audit periodically to check for waste.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way wages was set was by providing a general blueprint for labor allocation at the top, and lower-level managers would make fine-grained decisions about local labor. Then if there was a shortage of labor, they would be
                authorized to raise wages, and if there was a surplus, decrease wages. This worked pretty ok.
            </p>
            <p>Because this was not a problem, as was discovered 10 years after Mises was writing, people ignored Mises.</p>
            <p>2. He predicted it would be impossible to direct production efficiently from the top.</p>
            <p>
                Again, totally false in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, in those industries where the West had already made a blueprint, replicating the results of Western industry was a piece of cake, much faster in the USSR than in
                the West. Industrialization and steel production was exceeding quotas within 10 years in the first two five-year plans, and the development of heavy industry happened about 20 times faster in the USSR than in the West,
                because it was a central control reproducing something already known.
            </p>
            <p>3. He predicted that the socialist economics would squelch entrepreneurship and initiative.</p>
            <p>
                Bingo. He got that one mostly right. At least in consumer industries, which require decentralized businesses. In heavy industry, the innovation was pretty much on par with the West, not always, but usually. In some cases
                ahead, in some cases behind. In consumer goods, it was uniformly terrible.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main thrust of his argument was “economic calculation”, meaning setting and adjusting prices for maximum output. This was surprisingly not a problem, and a lot of ingenuity went into setting up the bureaucracy in the
                1930s and 1940s to deal with this issue. That problem was largely solved, and prices in the East, while not great, were functioning scarcity signals (not quite market signals). To learn about the details of Soviet planning,
                I recommend a little (anti-Soviet) book called “How the Soviet System Works” from 1956. I read that as a kid.
            </p>
            <p>
                The claims people make about gross inefficiencies in the heavy industry sector are not borne out by comparing output. In the farming sector, where the West was dominated by small farmers, the Soviets were abysmal. But the
                Soviet farms were comparable to Western factory farms, although somewhat less efficient.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mises simply was not focused on initiative and entrepreneurship, he was focused on economic calculation. His critique was brain dead, and it was rejected because it was false from USSR experience. It was revived after the
                collapse, as people began to forget how the Soviet system worked, and what its real problems were.

                It doesn’t matter how low it is, it is NOT HEDGED BY BUNDLING. So if the risk of housing going down is, say 4% (it wasn’t, it was more like 90%, but let’s pretend), the risk of loss on the bundle STAYS 4% no matter how many
                loans are in the bundle! That means the loans ALWAYS carry a 4% risk of total collapse no matter how many are put together, you don’t get to reduce the risk below 4%.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s the difference between a correlated event, like declining housing prices leading to a million defaults, and an uncorrelated event, like individual defaults here and there in a stable market, which are statistically
                independent. When you model a correlated risk as uncorrelated, you are effectively wiping away all the risk, and, as a credit rating agency, you are engaging in fraud. You are making a risky investment look rock solid.

                Fanny and Freddie’s $187.5 billion shortfall is a cost of mortgage subsidies, and this is a manageable relatively insignificant problem. On the other hand, AIG and Goldman Sach’s and other banks’ TRILLION DOLLAR bailout is
                the economy collapsing disaster.
            </p>
            <p>
                How does a $187.5 billion shortfall turn into a trillion dollar problem? That happens when a ratings agency gives fraudulent ratings to bundled loans, and someone notices, and tries to take advantage of it by buying
                insurance against the loans.
            </p>
            <p>
                It has nothing to do with the mortgage paying public, it has nothing to do with lenders, or borrowers, the only people at fault are those who mismodelled the risk of the bundles, and the folks who tried to take advantage of
                the bad rating to make a profit instead of reporting the bad assessment to regulators and to the public. If they hadn’t been bailed out, they would all be out of business when AIG would have collapsed, and Goldman Sachs in
                response, and GOOD RIDDANCE.

                Mises when the USSR was a current thing. The price signals functioned exactly the same in the USSR as in any Capitalist economy (after the USSR trade and labor system was set up in the 1930s) What was true is that innovation

                Kennedy changed course in 1960, and rejected state control, but he was shot. Carter (and McGovern, Hart, Mondale, Dukakis, Clinton) were all in the Kennedy mold, pro-market. Carter changed Fed policy to combat inflation, the
                austerity probably cost him the presidency, but inflation ended with Volker. He deregulated airlines for competition, the most innovative anti-consolidation policy the US had seen since Teddy Roosevelt, and sued AT&amp;T to
                break up the monopoly. Reagan took credit for Carter’s inflation control, deregulation, and AT&amp;T breakup (it started in 1979 and completed in 1984), but his party’s only contribution was extending the sensible
                pro-competition Carter policies in favor of big-business, using his nonsense economic doctrine.

                “Economic computation” is Mises’ nonsense, he has no idea what a planned economy looks like, and what its problems are. Economic calculation is not what stalled the Soviet economy. It was stalled because you couldn’t start a
                new venture, and you couldn’t update old ones, because nobody could move the bureaucracy, not even the secretary general. The system was permanently frozen. This is a product of lack of freedom, the lack competition, the
                top-down command structure, and it is reproduced in capitalist monopolized economies, which are only slightly better at innovation than Soviet ones. I guess the freezing is why Stalin purged the whole party, firing all the
                managers every 5 years. But the managers didn’t like that, for obvious reasons, so it ended with Khrushchev.
            </p>
            <p>
                Setting wages and prices didn’t take a whole lot of effort. The pricing calculation was relatively easy— they priced the product to recover the material and labor costs at current purchases, plus return on capital for
                overall expansion. They priced wages to attract people into places they were needed, so that a precision machinist earned a salary 4 times as big as a restaurant manager. There was also incentive pay, to reward workers who
                did better work, but that peaked under Stalin, Khruschev reduced the incentive pay, because it was a paperwork hassle, and there was a lot of fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
                These mechanisms are pretty much the same as any gigantic corporation in the US. The wages in the Soviet Union were one of the few successes, they were always nearly exactly equal to what they would be in a perfect
                capitalist equilibrium, because the method of wage allocation was really a free market in disguise. The labor was entirely free to switch jobs, everyone was employed, and the wages were set to attract the right number of
                people, like in an ideal free market. Nobody in the USSR said it was like a free market of course, but it was. By the end, there were a whole lot of people who were disgusted with the repression and their lack of power and
                freedom, and refused to work at all.

                The real issue that doomed planning was that it was impossible to plan for new integrated industry, like for example personal computers, or even updating industry for transistors instead of vacuum tubes (the USSR used vacuum
                tubes until the end). The personal computer industry started in the USSR in 1987 or 1988, only by copying the division of labor established in the West spontaneously. The first personal computers came from Bulgaria in the
                late 1980s, and they were similar to 1983 models in the West, they were 64K machines with a 1MHz microprocessor, but surprisingly they were pretty adequate. The computers were behind by about 5-10 years, but this is
                tantamount to 20 years for computers.

                The USSR heavy industry and big minicomputers and mainframes were not significantly behind, they were completely competitive. It’s just that this sector was done by big business in the West, while PCs were made by small
                startups. The USSR had no problem competing with any of the large Western firms, the bigger the firm, the easier it was for them to compete. What it couldn’t compete with at all was all the SMALL businesses. This is is the
                main clue as to the problem is, and what it’s counterpart is in the West. It’s the big concentrations of power, whether state or corporate, that stall economic innovation, as they lock out most of the brainpower in jobs
                which don’t make use of their brains.

            <p>The USSR’s success in oil extraction is due to the discovery in 1952 of the Abiotic theory of oil formation, during an all-union conference on oil. It was debated for 20 years, and eventually won out in the USSR.</p>
            <p>
                The theory was suggested by the correlation in coal and oil deposits, and the correlation of both with natural gas (they form by completely different pathways in the biological theory, and have no reason to be found
                together). The question of formation required a mechanism to form oil from methane, and the hypothesis was that methane is unstable in the mantle to forming short chain hydrocarbons. Thie prediction was demonstrated
                conclusively in pressure anvil experiments, which showed exactly that: methane forms hydrocarbon chains spontaneously at mantle pressures. This was reproduced in the USSR many times, and in the West in the 1990s by Gold, and
                just recently again.
            </p>
            <p>
                The theory was put to use by drilling and discovering oil in deep bedrock. The West never caught up with these advances, they had no incentives to develop deep borehole technology while there was still a lot of surface oil,
                so they didn’t bother with understanding the science properly. The Russians ignored the West, and just went and drilled extremely deeply all over Siberia, in a giant grid, with boreholes that went 10km down, far below any
                fossil line, until they found all the oil they needed (and more). They continued to do deep-drilling all over the communist world, there is a 10km well in Vietnam that produces a ton of oil. The Western denial on this was an
                outright embarrassment for decades, although it’s ending now, finally, because of the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the West’s version of Lysenkoism, it’s a complete farce. The reason is that oil scientists are all working in a large corporate environment, and are just as blind by their power structure as the Soviets were
                regarding genetics. There is a Western review by Thomas Gold called “The Deep Hot Biosphere” which explains this in detail, but with no references to Russian work, as Gold was trying to steal the theory (he was fluent in
                Russian, unlike other researchers).

                It’s not about the right people, it’s about avoiding concentrations of government and corporate power. Socialist in the 20th century wanted to increase government power, and Marxist Leninists even wanted to increase
                corporate power, so as to “heighten the contradictions”, meaning make them ripe for state takeover, like Atlee took over the coal mines, and more recently, Obama took over GM (for a while). Big corporations, whether owned by
                the state or by plutocrats, that’s the Soviet model, not the competitive model that produces innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern socialists work in the opposite direction, to reduce government and corporate power, by making uniform regulations that distribute ownership broadly. Sanders is firmly in this tradition, he has opposed concentrations
                of corporate and government power consistently, and his policy favors small business.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t advocate the state implementing socialism by confiscating private property, I advocate workers creating and owning their own business by creating distributed wealth. Pro-small-business policy helps remove the
                concentrations of power that block worker owned business. Remember that every private family-owned business, every independent contractor, every independent farmer, is a worker-owned business in disguise.

                Except Christopher Marlowe also participated in espionage activity, in this case against Catholics in France, for the protestant British, and also wrote under a front for many years after his personal atheistic doctrine led
                him to get blacklisted, namely William Shakespeare. The parallel between Trumbo and Marlowe is the thing that makes Trumbo an important writer for me, I didn’t like his stuff all that much otherwise. It feels too didactic
                for my taste, too wedded to Soviet realism. The only thing I like of his unreservedly so far is his excellent 1972 or 1973 movie about the assassination of Kennedy.

                I am not only a 9/11 truther, I am also a 7/7 truther, a Madrid bombing truther, a Sandy Hook truther an Oslo Shooting truther, and an Oklahoma City bombing truther. The reason is that all these events coincide with
                government drills simulating the same event at the same time at the same place. When you have a government drill simulating the same event, you don’t need Jews, Christians, Mossad, MI6, illuminati, or Santa Claus. You just
                need a criminal with a high-level security clearance in charge of the drill.

            <p>
                I am on the fence regarding the recent Paris attack, there was a drill at the same time, but it was an emergency personnel drill, it was only tangentially related to the attack, and it could be just a coincidence. I don’t
                know about that one, that could be ISIS. ISIS itself is one giant psy-op with deadly consequences.

                There are Chicago school economics departments and Keynsian departments, about 50/50— they were all Keynsian in 1970, except maybe Chicago. That’s completely insane, considering the track record. I met a few purged academics
                here and there, mostly leftist humanities former professors, with better publication records than the conservatives who were tenured. In my own undergrad school, they got rid of the last Marx guy, Cornel West, for making a
                rap album and acting in a way unbecoming of a professor (they mean, for behaving like a proletarian). The boundaries of academic debate are bounded between “conservative Republican” and “conservative Democrat”. The US no

                sort of homeland security drill, a drill which the organizer manipulated to turn live probably by replacing fake bombs with real ones at the last minute. None of these blackwater people would know anything more than that a

                You can continue to believe that, but Say’s law was just as false in 19th century England, with no government to speak of, as Marx showed in Capital I. He also identified the cause of this— the reason is that employee wages
                are not in equilibrium, they fall to subsistence, when employees compete with the unemployed. This is an economic fact, Say’s law is false independent of government intervention, and you can see it in every industrialized
                economy in history, whether the imbalance was corrected by government spending, or whether it was let to develop naturally into slums and depression.

                To understand it, imagine an economy of 10 firms with 10,000 employees, who produce 800 Widgets per employee, which are consumed by the employees. Now introduce 100 new employees, and let them compete for jobs with the
                10,000 already there. Equilibrium response is to absorb the labor in a new factory, or make some workers part-time at the same wage. But this can’t happen instantly, and what happens is that the unemployed drive all the
                wages down to subsistence, say 20 Widgets per worker, corporate profits go through the roof, the investors get insanely rich, and the workers can’t buy the products, and the economy crashes, leading the factories to be idle.
                This is what was observed in the great depression, and in every recession before intervention.

                The minimum wage does not come from “the pockets of the rich”, it comes from revenue to the business. The business doesn’t have to be owned by any rich person, it can be owned by a poor person, by the employees, or by
                another corporation. The reinvestment of private capital is important, but it isn’t done best by “rich people”, they do nonsense. It is done by banks who lend money to ventures, and by venture-capital firms with
                professionals who make investments, and who are paid a salary to do so. They aren’t usually investing their own money, their incentive for doing a good job is their professional reputation. Angel investors are not any better

                who discovered that Says law is bunk is Marx. It’s still bunk, but people stopped giving credit to Marx for this discovery.

                independent. Their physics was superb.

                Vaclav Havel was not a free market conservative— “we did not make this revolution to restore capitalism”. He was voted out of office relatively quickly for his lackluster support of market reforms, reforms which were

                The left opposed Soviet meddling in Eastern Europe since 1956, it was a big deal, the break of the left with the USSR, it was the end of communism in the left. There is a nice personal account of this period in Lessing’s
                “The Golden Notebook”, it documents the USSR-rejecting transformation that produced the new left and second-wave feminism. Western leftists supported Dubcek’s reforms, and to the extent that they looked to the East for
                inspiration, they looked at Tito’s Yugoslavia. You aren’t on the left, you really don’t know.

                This is a tangential discussion, and one that Bernie Sanders would not approve of, but the US military was conducting drills on that morning, all under the supervision of the aforementioned pace-maker-bearing vice president.
                These drills simulated multiple simultaneous hijackings, simulated crashing airplanes into buildings, and put God-knows-what military airplanes in the air, flying in crazy circles. They also had a drill for simultaneous
                hijacking in air-traffic control, which inserted all sorts of fake blips into the radar and air-traffic data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Putting these drills together to pull off a 9/11 attack is a piece of cake, I’ll let you figure out how it’s done. There is absolutely no excuse for a supposedly random terrorist attack to coincide with these specific set of
                simultaneous drills, the only drills that allow the drill coordinator to fake the attack without a massive conspiracy. There is no rational way to blow off the drills, and I have written about it elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p>Bin Laden is as important as Groucho Marx, he was a patsy, probably dead not long after the attack. The whole attack was a fabrication from start to finish, and the drills are the conclusive evidence.</p>
            <p>
                Both Clintons are associated with similarly suspicious events, that look like covert nonsense. Hillary takes credit for “killing Bin Laden”, which looks like a total psi-op, and under Bill Clinton, there was the mightily
                suspicious Oklahoma City bombing, which coincided with an ATF drill, and looks to me like the early prototype for 9/11. I don’t support Clinton, and I don’t want to have to vote for her, but I will have to, just to avoid
                more nonsense economics and neocon foreign policy. I want this nonsense to end, and Bernie Sanders is the best bet for this too.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a tangential argument, it is not something Sanders ever said, but it is important anyway, for one’s own sanity. I wrote about the drills and 9/11 elsewhere, google “9/11 drills” or “9/11 drills + my name” to get more
                details, if you want. Or don’t.

                Conservatives got 3000 Americans killed by murdering them in the Twin Towers. At least, I should say more accurately, one of them did, the one in charge of the military drills of that morning, the guy with the pacemaker. I’m
                sure they did it because they love America, and wanted America to have a strong foreign policy. They still should be swinging from a tree for it.

                Hillary Clinton supports lawsuits for guns that work as intended, and are used for crimes without the knowledge of the manufacturer. Sanders supports lawsuits for gun manufacturers that sell to the insane or the criminal, or
                who sell large quantities of guns which they know will be diverted to criminals. Sanders’ position is common sense, and can win Republican support. Clinton’s position butts right up against the second amendment, and is

                Progressive taxes are necessary when there are people siphoning off corporate profits into their pockets. That’s not private property exactly, that taking a publically owned corporation and stealing from every shareholder by

                Patents are government granted monopolies, and the constitution declares that they are granted only as long as they serve the public interest, as that is their purpose. The terms of patents and copyrights are to be adjusted

                unemployment. Both of these practices amount to taking other people’s money. The goal of Sanders’ policies is to approach a free market equilibrium, where you nearly always don’t have to worry about falling into a $2,000,000
                tax bracket, because there are competitors undercutting you on price preventing you from making that much in the first place.

                The Soviet totalitarian system was extremely stable for 70 years, through several invasions and with constant anti-Soviet propaganda, it needed internal reform to fall apart. The Soviets knew the system could disintegrate
                with reform, this is why they avoided doing it, despite constant pressure to reduce the bureaucracy (there were several proposed reforms along the lines Gorbachev adopted in 1965 that were rejected).
            </p>
            <p>
                You have to understand how fragile and interconnected top-down planning structures are— if you are manufacturing paper products in Czechoslovakia, furniture in Hungary, and computers in Bulgaria, then ALL your paper products
                come from a gigantic state firm in Czechoslovakia, ALL your furniture is made in a gigantic state firm in Hungary, and ALL your computers come from a gigantic firm in Bulgaria. It’s like an economy consisting entirely of
                WalMarts and Dells, no small firms at all, and everything directed by Gosplan. It’s like corporatism on steroids, and all run by a single monopolist, the government.
            </p>
            <p>
                That means that if Czechoslovakia breaks ranks politically, your leadership says “Uh oh! They are going to take our furniture away, and we invested in that…”, when Hungary is fed up, the leadership says “we need paper
                products for East Germany and Ukraine”, etc. The political repression is a natural outgrowth of the top-down structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gorbachev provided the reform by changing state owned firms to report earnings, and requiring them to post profits, as was suggested by earlier reformers in the 1960s. The problem with this is that all the firms are
                monopolies, so the easiest way to get better cash flow is simply to restrict your production, until those next in the chain complain, and offer better prices. As soon as Gorbachev introduced for-profit reforms, the shortages
                began, as industrial production began to contract, in order to meet profit quotas, rather than product quotas. In the west, such behavior is controlled by competition, if you won’t provide screws, someone else will. In the
                USSR, there was one national screw-maker, and whoever was in charge controlled the price of screws.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reforms allowing small business allowed certain people to get rich, and other folks, state-planners, said “if only there was private industry, I am in a good position to own this gigantic state monopoly”. When Gorbachev
                fell, the three representatives of business leaders in the USSR, Yeltsin and two others, decided to dissolve the union, and to privatize the state-owned firms to their constituencies in the party, which they did. This
                created the Russian oligarchy nearly overnight. There was no structured introduction of capitalism, as in China, it was a free-for-all, it was the worst collapse you can imagine.
            </p>
            <p>Reagan and Thatcher had nothing to do with it, except providing moral support to those opposing communism, something leftists all over the world had been doing also for decades.</p>
            <p>
                If you are a former Marxist, you have to understand that the failure of this ideology is the failure of state power. Socialism is not about state power, it is about correcting the problems of capitalism. One must do this in
                a decentralized manner, without top-down control, and this is much trickier than nationalizing industries. I didn’t spend any time in the Marxist movement, I hated totalitarianism, my parents and grandparents knew about
                communist repression firsthand, and anyway it disintegrated when I turned 20. But I still studied it intensely, because I wanted to understand what they did. There are many things they did that give lessons, if only in how
                NOT to do things.

                There was no deep poverty or famine anywhere in Eastern Europe after 1945, or in the USSR past WWII either, for that matter. There was dictatorship and general lack of innovation. Eastern Europe didn’t revolt because they
                were so poor, they revolted because they were enslaved.

                Leftists did not support Soviet meddling in Eastern Europe— most of the left rejected the USSR completely in 1956, when the Hungarians rose up and the Soviets crushed them. Any remaining pro-Soviet left was gone by 1968,
                with the Prague spring. The revolutions in Eastern Europe were long overdue, but they didn’t quite elect free-market capitalists. Poland elected Lech Walesa, who was a socialist labor leader who opposed Soviet communism. The
                Czechs elected Vaclav Havel, a leftist playwright, also opposed to Soviet power. These revolutionaries were usually advocating modified forms of socialism publically, but compromised on capitalism as this was a proven system
                that got them outside support.

                Their governments had no economic experience with capitalism, and they implemented shock-treatment, as it was called, to modernize their economy at once. Then US and Western European corporations came in, and provided jobs
                and investment, and those countries did ok. The USSR also implemented shock treatment, but there it was a catastrophe. Industrial production collapsed by 50%, and the whole country turned into a den of gangsters,
                prostitutes, and drug addicts. Russia has not recovered it’s science, it’s industry, nothing. It just is free of Soviet totalitarianism, which is progress.

                The fascists got lists of leftists from paid informants, and they extended the lists (inaccurately) by waterboarding those they captured. The fascists and the communists are people in total opposition. They recruit from the
                same pool of people, but toward diametrically opposite ends.

                That’s nonsense, it happened as it was said to happen. Communists are absolutely terrible at covert activities, they act by overt recruiting among poor folks and labor unions. Covert stuff is something the CIA does, with
                little supervision. There is no way Castro could do it, because he would need a competent team acting nearly completely independently, so as not to get found out, and such teams are not part of a top-down dictatorship.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only successful covert communist activities were taking place in the 1940s, when many of the communists were decentralized partisans, which was necessary to win World War II. These formerly communist partisans formed the
                Yugoslavian government, noticed the imposition of power from Moscow and the terrible system, and they rejected Stalinism and Leninism, in favor of a worker-owned Socialist model. Moscow was simply awful at covert activities
                always.

                The country is in economic crisis partly because the price of oil collapsed, and they are reliant on oil exports. They also have issues with a private sector that can’t stand the government, and colludes with the US to
                produce crisis periodically, as they did during the oil strike. But they also have some bad economic management, it’s true, but some mismanagement is far better than having a 60% poverty rate and a 25% abject poverty rate.

                Yeah, read the article. The CIA wanted to turn Venezuela into Florida or Ohio, and failed. I don’t know if you noticed, but 3 out of the last 4 presidential elections in the US have been marred by irregularities, which means
                exit polling and voting results have been out of sync by more than is statistically plausible. In other countries, matching exit polling to tallies is how the UN determines whether fraud has occured, and the US failed that
                test repeatedly, in 2000, in 2004, and in 2012 (and never significantly before 2000).
            </p>
            <p>
                The Venezuelans instituted automatic double-counting, which is like automatic exit-polling, to ensure that they can spot check every ballot box. They audited something like 54% of the ballot boxes, and audited more after the
                challenge from the opposition. There was no fraud, there was just more US shenanigans, as usual. Except less competently than usual.

                Their small business exists, it is disappearing elsewhere. That’s due to sensible government that allows local business to compete against takeover attempts by national chains, and Bernie Sanders pioneered this, while the
                rest of the US small business disintegrated. Ben and Jerry’s is a national ice-cream supplier, very pro-Bernie, and emblematic of the kind of quirky innovative business that thrives there, and nowhere else. The closer you
                get to Vermont, the more you see small business thrive. It’s a North-East thing, and it needs to be national.

                Except Keynes correctly predicted the inflation rate every year since 2008, while your favorite economists predicted doubling or tripling of prices. The same with unemployment rates when the minimum wage was last raised, and
                for Russian prices during the 90s Russian quantitative easing. Sorry, but when a theory predicts quantitative effects correctly, it is simply correct.

                post-traumatic stress. Bernie Sanders is no communist, he is very good to small business in Vermont. He even did some things that leftists don’t like, like shutting down a protest in front of an arms manufacturer in his
                state, and agreeing to big development on Vermont coastline which leftists opposed, but that he felt would be good for business. He is a very sensible leader.

                It has NOTHING to do with the ability to repay! Even if I can pay a $200,000 mortgage on my home, if it is worth $150,000 total, and even if I put in $40,000 already on a $240,000 initial value, I’m just not going to pay the
                rest! I’m better off cutting the losses, default, lose the house, and repurchase the house or a comparable house for $150,000. I still saved $10,000 on the deal, even after losing the house and the $40,000.
            </p>
            <p>
                This completely predictable default situation means that the “historical data” was worthless, because the “historical data” was from history when housing prices only went up, not down. When housing prices go down, the loans
                become worthless because default becomes the RATIONAL THING TO DO. So it’s not that the folks can’t pay, it’s that they won’t pay, because they SHOULDN’T pay. They are overpaying.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even if all these folks did the IRRATIONAL thing and paid off their mortgage, the value of these securities still plummets, because there is no way you are going to feel safe in assuming that a bunch of homeowners are going
                to be stupid enough to pay off a loan worth more than the property, and lose money just to make you happy.

                That’s what turned these assets to junk, and everyone who bet against these assets knew that this scenario was likely, excepting AIG, who didn’t know. The ratings agencies should have known, and if they didn’t it’s gross
                incompetence, and if they did, it’s fraud. Since they were paid by the bundlers to rate assuming uncorrelated default, the latter is more likely.

                The heads of Nordic governments are from the conservative side of the aisle right now, and they generally agree with the more conservative Democrats in the US. The more progressive democrats would be center-left in
                Scandinavia, and all their debates are what we would call internal debates in the Democratic party.
            </p>
            <p>
                I assume you are referring to the president of Norway talking about Scandinavian socialism— it is very friendly to free markets, and he made this point. Sanders wishes to do no more than this, it is only called “socialism”
                in the US.
            </p>
            <p>
                The thing is, Scandinavian socialism in the past was more radical in its aims, advocating worker control of industry, strong labor unions, and so on. These aspects would not be supported by conservative governments in
                Scandinavia, but I am sure they would be by the leftists there. But free college, free health-care, strong employment provisions, these are universally supported, and these are the core of Sanders’ platform.

                Sanders has a better than 50% chance of winning Iowa and New Hampshire right now, according to polling, it all depends on voter turnout. This is a fact acknowledged by both campaigns. The effect of early wins changes the
                race substantially, as it did for Obama.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would estimate he has a reasonable chance in Nevada, due to massive advertising, and his money parity. Visibility is key. Nevada might tip entirely and give him a big win, it is impossible to predict, as Nevada, like Iowa,
                is a caucus state, and these can be won with an energized turnout.

                People vote Clinton strategically, as they believe Clinton is in a stronger position in the general. This is not at all objectively true. Republicans detest Clinton, and often grudgingly admire Sanders, and sometimes agree
                with his positions on the Fed, on guns, on big banks, on foreign trade, on taxes, etc, it’s different by voter. He also has a strong pro-small-business history that can make many business owners flip allegiance. He polls
                slightly but statistically significantly better than Clinton against the various Republicans.

                This is false— government regulation has often fostered competitive markets where none existed before. This is a staple of Democrat deregulation (Republican deregulation is just a way of allowing big business to do whatever
                it wants). An example is the Airline Deregulation bill of 1978— this opened up the infrastructure to any airline that wanted to compete, and led to a slew of smaller competitors like Southwest and Jet Blue and an unheard of
                reduction in prices. Carter also sued Bell to break up the phone monopoly in 1979, the lawsuit completed in 1984, leading to the breakup of Bell into the “baby Bells”, and competition, with infrastructure shared. The
                competition didn’t become real until Clinton signed the 1996 telecom deregulation act, which led to a slew of small phone and cable companies competing to be ISPs and producing phone-cards and local and international service
                at ever decreasing rates. These pro-competition deregulation policies were reversed under Bush, who allowed the remonopolization of internet through cable companies with an infrastructure monopoly, and allowed the
                monopolization of cellular infrastructure through Verizon. The same remedy can be applied again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, the US government had an anti-trust lawsuit pending against MicroSoft, to allow software competitors in the browser market. That anti-trust lawsuit was dismissed by Bush II, on one of his first days in office, who
                recieved large campaign contributions from Microsoft. Now Apple and Microsoft are completely unregulated monopolies in their sector, and you can’t copy pictures from your iPad to your computer, you can’t run Flash under
                Apple’s iOS, and you need to jailbreak your iPhone to be able to use it properly. That’s what monopolization gets you.
            </p>
            <p>The anti-trust business goes back decades, under both Republicans and Democrats, until Reagan. Since Reagan, it’s only Democrats. Sorry to tell you.</p>
            <p>
                Carbon regulations impact big and small business equally. Not all regulations do, however. Pasteurization is a pro-big-business regulation, as small farmers can get clean milk without Pasteurization, while big commercial
                farms can’t. Pasteurization equipment is expensive for small farmers.
            </p>
            <p>
                But this is the exception, not the rule. Sanders is a pro-small-business guy, he has immense approval from Vermont business owners, because he knows which regulations hurt small business, and which regulations help small
                business, or are equal in their impact on both small and large business. Just because you are used to a corrupt bought-out government doesn’t mean this is the way it has to be, or the way it will be. You should vote for
                Sanders, to get government off the back of small business, and onto the back of anti-competitive big business.

                That’s total nonsense. The people with the most money, like Bill Gates, “innovated” with version after shoddy version of Windows, and were put to shame by Richard Stallman and Linus Torvalds, who had a capitalization of $0,
                they worked in their spare time. All the innovation in Linux comes from academics, small firms, and large firms who share the product without undue monopolization. The best coders are not wealthy folks.

            <p>
                Elon Musk makes nonsense products, as his technical judgement is extremely poor. He is able to do so because he got an early monopoly on internet payment through “Paypal”, suddenly propelling him to billionaire. The
                production of an internet monopoly is not a sign of genius, it is a sign of being first to stake a claim. Somebody happened to have done it, and it happened to be Musk. He has no creative bone in his body.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you have “innovators” who hire people to do all the actual innovating, you shouldn’t call them innovators. The people they are hiring are the innovators. And there is little incentive to innovate when some lazy
                businessman is going to take the credit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course I have participated in business, I was one of the founding members of a reasonably successful start up. As always, it was the case that the “innovators” at the top do nothing of value except hand-shaking and
                schmoozing, and bleed their creative folks dry, then hang them out to dry (as they did me, and several others). This is why creative engineering and science is so rarely done in business, and never in competitive business,
                instead it is usually state-funded.

                America is not driven by a “positive can-do abundance mentality”, it is driven by Keynsian spending, and big-business oligarchies that are cemented by ties to big government, along with imperial adventures abroad. The US at
                one point had a healthy entrepreneur class, but it was destroyed by large business. US innovation has never been done by those big-business owners you like to fetishize. It was done by poor people, like Richard Stallman (who
                is not so poor anymore, having recieved a MacArthur, and also not so productive). Steve Wozniak was not rich either when he designed the Apple II, and he didn’t do much of anything after he got rich.

                I didn’t follow it, I just remember the past allegations of stolen elections, and what nonsense they were. I’ll look at the blogs, and get back to you, but I doubt it was anything other than a free and fair election, because
                it always was under Chavez, even when he lost his “special powers” referendum by a teeny-tiny margin.

                The Soviet Union was one huge dictatorship, dude, I don’t know what you’re talking about. Modern Russia is not “neo-communist” in the least, they aren’t even mildly socialist. Putin is fervently anti-communist, he would
                think Bernie Sanders is a “wrecker”, as are all the political parties in Russia. The Russians have been on a neoliberal trip since the 1990s, despite the terrible destruction of their economy by oligarchs. They suffered too
                much under communism to understand the value of socialism. The same goes for most Eastern Europeans who suffered under communism, like my mother’s side of the family. They have been so traumatized by the terrible system they
                lived under that they can’t see the sound academic theory. It’s like a former cult-member having a knee-jerk opposition to all religion.

                Socialism is the foundation of all economic thought since 1933. It’s fundamental principles are built into Keynesianism. There is no nation that hasn’t practiced some form of socialism aside from failed economies in South
                America (until recently), with the majority of the population living in slums.

                It was a bill to continuously audit the Fed. It had no chance of passage, Sanders modified it to a one-time audit, which passed (I think). Now Sanders has a regular Fed audit as part of his presidential platform. Sanders and
                Paul agree on the Fed, as far as openness and anti-corruption measures. Sanders doesn’t support a gold standard, though.

                I agree. The inspiring new model for me, not anything like Socialism, Fascism, or Capitalism is Linux development. These is very competitive, and sometimes public and sometimes private, and always successful. Software is
                like a micro-society where you can experiment with political systems without wrecking nations.

                But a new party is for the future. Right now, I think that backing Sanders is the only way to break the stranglehold of big business on US government. I would have been backing Paul if he wasn’t such a Chicago school guy,
                one of the two Pauls even backed a gold standard.

            <p>As far as I know, I am the first person to say this stuff. I came to this conclusion myself, after reading Marx and Keynes. Who am I parrotting? I would like to read them…</p>

            <p>I am not a politician, I am an academic by training, and I don’t sell out fellow academics, even when it is politically expedient.</p>
            <p>
                Marx is the most influential and important academic in the humanities, and that’s just by counting citations (he is the best cited academic in history). He is the most original and significant economist of the 19th century,
                by far, and the first person to compile labor and wage statistics on a national scale to test economic theory in practice. His academic descendants include the anti-colonial movement, feminism, gay rights, Keynesianism, half
                of literary criticism (the good half, the other half is Nietzche’s), all of sociology, and all public funding models for science and technology.
            </p>
            <p>Sorry, it is not right to sell out Marx because Lenin got associated with him. His ideas are important, regardless of the unpopularity of his follower’s positions in the US.</p>
            <p>Also, while collective farms suck, nationalized oil extraction in the USSR ran circles around everybody else, mostly because Soviet science figured out the correct theory of the origin of oil and the West didn’t.</p>

                Modern socialists aren’t about centralizing production, or producing top-down heirarchies, or nationalizing anything at all. They are about making sure workers have a bigger say in the workplace, wages are higher, and small
                business is allowed to compete with big business. You forget that there was a nation called “Yugoslavia” where socialism meant that workers owned the business, and the government mostly butted out of their workplace. They
                didn’t have any walls, people came and left as they wished. The Scandinavian states emulated Yugoslavia, not Russia.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly in the US, there was road-construction Keynsianism and military spending Keynsianism, permanently since the second world war. There is no country on Earth which has not had a Keynsian or socialist policy, except
                for total economic basket-cases in South America, where Chicago school policy was enforced by US decree, which became split into a wealthy oligarchy and massive slums where 70% of the population lived in squalor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Socialism is a big movement, and you are examining the statist fraction, because you don’t want to look at the successes. The point of socialism is to correct the failures of capitalism, not to put a government in charge of
                your life. That was the USSR, and nobody advocates that nonsense today.

                You don’t understand structural reforms— when you break up a widget maker, you get the same amount of widgets, except now from two competing firms, or else from a collection of firms which together produce the widget, but
                now independently run, and open to competition.
            </p>
            <p>The result of such competition and restructuring is that the price goes down, and you get innovation.</p>
            <p>
                The “better prices” at large stores are only better because of anti-competitive practices. I would prefer to pay a higher price and make sure that there are no non-competitive practices. Getting a deal because someone is
                being paid a slave wage, or because a company muscled its way to a better contract that a small business wouldn’t get, that means you are destroying small businesses, and wrecking the entrepreneurial potential for innovation
                and growth.

                A structural remedy for large size is absolutely necessary, so as to get the WalMarts to disintegrate into local stores with local ownership. Once they do, they are open to competition, their workers have a say, and you will
                get an explosion of new and diverse products, as you did before WalMart and co. homogenized the US.

                The minimum wage increase business is not circular, it is based on the “Say’s law” principle of economic equilibrium— wages in equilibrium are determined by the negotiating power of employees, and by choice of where to work,
                and this is supposed to produce an amount of income exactly sufficient for the aggregate of all workers to buy all commodities the market can be producing in equilibrium. If wages are too low for the employees to purchase
                all the commodities, you get a “general glut”, a “demand slump”, a “loss of consumer confidence”, whatever you want to call it, and the economic output will be below peak. This is a non-equilibrium effect, it is caused by
                unemployment, which reduces the power of employees to negotiate normal wages equal to their productivity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The existence of this phenomenon of too-low wages was both theoretically predicted by Marx, and demonstrated by him using labor wage statistics, first. That’s what the entire volume of Capital I is all about. Before Marx,
                this situation was thought to be impossible (it is impossible in the Chicago school philosophy), with a few economists wondering whether it did happen, as they were worried about periodic recessions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point is that anything that gets you closer to economic equilibrium increases economic efficiency, as equilibrium is the point of Pareto optimality, it’s the most production possible. This means that when the minimum
                wage is far below productivity per-employee, raising it moves you closer to the equilibrium wage, and produces more demand to offset the cost. When it doesn’t do this, it produces inflation instead, as the worker salaries
                stress production past its limits.
            </p>
            <p>The wage increases need to be done gradually, to allow the extra demand to kick in, and this is what Sanders proposes— he proposes a raise to $15 over two years or so, gradually rising to a living wage.</p>
            <p>
                Regarding large corporate power, Democrats vary. Obama has not been very strong in opposing it, but Carter pushed through airline deregulation that favored small airlines in 1978, and began the AT&amp;T anti-trust lawsuit.
                This was the model for the successful parts of the 1996 telecom deregulation act under Clinton— this separated infrastructure from service, and allowed many small telecoms to compete in both phone and internet service. The
                internet remonopolized through cable monopolies, and the phone remonopolized through wireless. Democrats often are able to push through competition acts, which allow competition even in monopolized industry. This is sorely
                needed in wireless and cable right now. Internet cable service in the US is completely monopolized by two non-competing firms (TW cable and Comcast) and these have an infrastructure monopoly. Likewise for Verizon, which has
                a virtual infrastructure wireless monopoly. The infrastructure and the service need to be separated, and the service companies need to get an equal rate for the infrastructure usage, as was done successfully with phone in
                1984 and for internet in 1996. The competition under Clinton’s economy was very healthy, although some bad decisions were made which allowed consolidation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding the debt, this is an issue, but not as much of an issue for a country with control of it’s monetary policy. A government’s deby is not like a personal debt, it can be wiped away by inflation. I am not advocating
                that much inflation, but it must be kept in mind. Good progressive taxes can balance a budget even with increased spending.
            </p>
            <p>
                The issue is that pro-competition policy, which used to be a Republican concern, is just not a Republican concern anymore. The whole party is bought out by big business. Only half the Democrats are bought out, and I’m voting
                for the half that’s still clean, as long as it exists. When it ceases to exist, we’ll be in trouble. Sanders has a pro-competition policy in mind, as you can see by both what he says and what he doesn’t say, and by his
                record with small business in Vermont, which is excellent, and earns him points with conservative Republicans all over that state.

                No. It is still fraud even when everyone pays their loans back, because the correlated risk model is not used. The false rating is what led to the collapse of AIG, as it was insuring the loans at wrong risk, and it couldn’t
                pay off all those who took insurance bets against the bundled loans.
            </p>
            <p>
                It makes no difference what the eventual outcome of the mortgages are, after government intervention and clean up. The problem was the risk model, and the fluctuating prices when the risk became far greater than the model
                predicted. The important thing in assessing rating agency fraud is whether the risk model was accurate (it was not) and whether the ratings agencies were in a position to know it was inaccurate (they were). You can’t allow
                ratings agencies to sell their ratings to the highest bidder, this is the path to collapse.

                The correlated default was a clear prediction that could be made before it happened, and was made, leading to the AIG insurance bets against the bundled loans by Goldman Sachs and others. When you have a ratings agency
                pricing loans as if their failure is independent, when it is not, that is malpractice, and when they make a profit from the rating, it becomes fraud.

            <p>
                The recovery of the nominal value on these securities is not a measure of the level of fraud— the fraud would have been there even if everyone paid back their loans. It’s the bad model that constitutes the fraud, knowingly
                ignoring correlations that others foresaw and bet against.

                The theory of the root causes has been understood for 100 years. It has nothing to do with government intervention, these types of monopolistic takeovers occured in the 19th century, when there was no government at all
                compared to modern times, and they occured in Europe, in the US, and in every industrializing economy. Of course I read the Austrian school, it is an atavistic throwback to the 18th century. They make predictions, for
                example, doubling of prices after quantitative easing in 2009, ten-fold rise in prices in Russia in the 90s after Russian quantitative easing, increased unemployment with rising minimum wage, and these predictions are not
                only false, they are the opposite of the truth. There is no success of Austrian economics, it is just a bunch of quackery propped up by big-money because it leads to policy they like.

                To understand Keynes well, you actually should read Marx’s “Capital”, although it’s long and obviously focused on 19th century events. The fundamental issue of low worker pay, monopolization, and declining demand is first
                raised in Marx, who uses this to predict the characteristics of the capitalist depression. Keynes is more of a popularizer, who gets several details wrong on purpose, so as to disguise his reliance on Marx, who, as always,
                is taboo in economics.

                Megacorps are competitive not because of government, but because they pay slave wages and muscle good contract deals due to their size. They can also dump products at a loss to put competitors out of business. To avoid this,

            <p>No, no, my friend. His campaign is based on sound economics.</p>
            <p>
                There is no justification for producing an economy with a class of wealthy people sucking corporate profits into their pockets, this is the path to financial collapse. In order to have an economic equilibrium, workers need
                to be making wages roughly equal to their productivity, give or take a small factor. When these workers compete with armies of unemployed, they are forced to work long hours, and their productivity goes into the owner’s
                pockets, and doesn’t show up as demand in the economy.
            </p>
            <p>
                This process leads to a loss of demand, and a recession or depression, and the only solution is policy to increase demand. Full employment policy is what Sanders advocates, through jobs, through taxation, through minimum
                wage increases (which decrease unemployment, despite what you read), and through breakup of anticompetitive big institutions. His policies are downright essential.

            <p>Bernie Sanders is the only one willing to call out the ratings agencies’ practices for what they are: fraud. It is an outright fraud to model correlated default risk as independent default.</p>
            <p>
                When you have a 60% chance that someone will pay you back, you have a .4 risk of default. For two people with the same risk, that’s .4 x .4 or .16, a 16% chance of default. For 5 people, that’s .4 to the 5th power, or .01, a
                1% risk. For 10 people, the risk is effectively zero. That’s why independent risk is used to hedge, you can bundle together risky investments to make them less risky.
            </p>
            <p>
                But that doesn’t work when there is a predictable event which can lead ALL the folks to default! In that case, modelling the risk as independent is an outright LIE. For subprime mortgages, the predictable event is housing
                prices falling, leading all the folks to default, because the mortgage is now suddenly greater than the property value.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a ratings agency ignores an obvious correlation, this is clear malpractice. When it is doing so because the rating is paid by the issuer, and the issuer is paying for a better rating, it becomes fraud. The distortions
                of ratings to please issuers is a systemic practice, and a systemic problem, even in milder cases where it didn’t crash the world’s economy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part of the solution to this is massive restructuring of the ratings agencies, removing the bribery potential by making them neutral nonprofits, financed by the investing public, not by the issuers of credit. This is what
                Bernie Sanders proposes. His proposals are the only educated and effective policies in the presidential race, and you have to be out of your mind not to support them, or him.

                In the 1930s, there was no monopolistic entity like WalMart to decimate small business all over America. The lessons of the 1930s was that Keyensian method work, full employment is necessary, and anyone who is first to
                implement full-employment policy, whether it’s FDR, Hitler, or Atlee will rescue the economy, and from then on be politically immune to criticism, bad or good.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lessons of the 1930s have already been forgotten by everyone except Bernie Sanders. He is the only one who is for implementing full employment policies, starting with subsidizing universities, an infrastructure jobs
                program, and raising the minimum wage, all of which are known to reduce unemployment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, the business press is dominated by quack Chicago school economics, which makes false predictions and produces terrible policy. Without reductions of unemployment, all the international trade in the world won’t
                save you, and with zero unemployment, international trade is a secondary consideration. International trade is only used now as a cudgel to reduce employee wages in the west, and this has the opposite effect on demand than
                what is required.

                The commercial ratings are subsidized by the lenders, and are manipulated politically by the large entities pushing for a good rating. A proper rating is something you can get when you have competing interests, and Sanders

                Except that the model of risk was fraudulent, as it assumed independent default risk. When property values go down, there is a certainty of massive correlated default, all the defaults come at the same time, because it makes
                no sense to pay a mortgage that is more than the property is worth. This is not an independent risk, it is a predictable correlated default, and it makes the bundled loans total junk. Taking a correlated risk and modelling
                it as an uncorrelated risk is a method of producing AAA ratings for whatever you want, because multiplying risks gets you to superficially 100% safe loans very quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this case, many people identified the correlations, and bought insurance against these bundled loans. The fact that a sizable percentage of all experts identified the problem means that even a government, let alone
                nonprofit or investor financed ratings agencies, heck, even a bunch of individuals who were free to speak publically about the problem, any of these would have caught the problem long before it became a crash. But the
                enormous structures in place, these enormous private businesses were not able to catch it, and that means they must be restructured.

                On the contrary, I was awake. Socialism replaced neoclassical economics during the great depression, in the form of Keyensian economics. The doctrine you support has destroyed economies with corporate takeovers and

                That’s completely false. The same monopolization happened in the 1890s, when there were no government regulations to speak of, in every industry. The modern hyper-monopolization is caused by the ability of large business to
                undercut small business on prices, using their lower costs on labor and their contracts with suppliers, which get them deals through their size.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both require structural reforms. To deal with labor costs, you need a high minimum wage. This has the effect of disfavoring large business by cutting into their margin. On average, 100 small businesses have 50% of their
                employees owners, who make a living salary. When they are replaced with a chain, 99% of the employees are wage-laborers, making minimum wage. When the minimum wage is a living wage, this is no gain for the corporation over
                the small business network.
            </p>
            <p>To deal with favoritism in contract pricing, you need real contract reform. This means transparent contracts with uniform pricing. This is what pro-competitive regulations are about.</p>
            <p>
                To deal with size, I suggest that you need a graduated corporate income tax, to break up big businesses naturally, without government intervention. A graduated tax based on number of employees is a strong incentive to keep
                firms small, and uniform contracts means competition can always start, while transparent contracts means competition always knows what exactly everyone else is up to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sanders and others can’t propose pro-competition policies so easily, because the campaign finance system prevents it. So he proposes executive action, on anti-trust and bank-breakup, and further proposes dealing with
                campaign finance, so that other pro-competition policy can be reinstated. He has innovative ideas in all the necessary areas.

                Standard credit-card loan rates in the US have not gone down despite the passage of “bankruptcy reform” which allows confiscation of income and property to repay debts. Loans have become more secure, credit banks are posting
                higher profits, and none of the benefits have come to consumers in the form of lower interest rates. This is a sign that you are dealing with monopolistic usury, with banks ensuring profit by draconianly difficult bankruptcy
                procedure, not with any sort of competitive lending. Similarly, payday lenders have outrageously noncompetitive interest rates, and their mere existence is a sign that you need immediate reform. Bernie Sanders has addressed
                these issues in his most recent policy speech, and I recommend you listen to it, instead of pontificating nonsense you read somewhere.

                The “Chicago school policy” in Chile was tied in to the fascist dictatorship— it was boosted by foreign investment, and creating large corporations. It was not organic growth by the production of local businesses. To allow
                local businesses to compete with multinationals, you need to have strong protection of small business, and fair-wages policies help in this regard. There are only two advantages to a big firm— being able to pay low wages,
                and being able to get special contracts from suppliers. You need to ban both to make the economy competitive for small business.

                You are addled if you think Switzerland goes by Chicago school. Every European economy has strong permanent Keynsian stimulus in the form of social welfare benefits and investments in schools, research, and construction.
                There is no exception. When unemployment gets close to zero, the minimum wage regulation becomes meaningless, because labor is scarce, and all wages begin to climb to their market equilibrium value. We saw this in the US in
                the late 1990s, when unemployment went below 4%. This is what Sanders advocates as the employment target today.

                OR OTHERWISE, that’s why it’s a perfect false flag— nobody can imagine what evil hearts could be behind it. In this case, the evil heart has a pacemaker.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bernie Sanders has not said anything about 9/11 truth, you must remember that the people who have access to secret documents are LEAST likely to understand what happens, because in this particular case, all the secret
                documents support the bogus government scenario. That’s not a coincidence, it’s a structural effect of US puppet organizations like Al-Qaeda being easily manipulated from within the government to say and do anything anyone
                wants, using a handful of agents.
            </p>
            <p>
                But Sanders has supported real transformation of government, including transparency and real openness (Obama promised this, but delivered the exact opposite). Sanders has been more consistent than either Paul in advocating
                for no compromise on civil liberties, and he advocates prosecution of financial figures from the last decade, prosecutions which in themselves open the door for prosecution of political terrorist criminals, as the network of
                power opposing prosecution is the same in either case. He supports the international court for war crimes, which is interested in figures from the Bush administration, and once one of these folks is on trial, the whole house
                of cards collapses, and the scientists and engineers can feel free to speak more clearly than they already have, and you get a public reconciliation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The issue here is government secrecy and clandestine operations, and this is engendered by the ties to powerful business as well as by the internal tiers of secrecy and the CIA. I trust Bernie Sanders to bust up the CIA and
                Homeland Security more than I trust Rand Paul to do it, or Ron Paul, as he opposed such clandestine covert activities even when they were happening in South America, not inside the US. Also, he has the added bonus that he
                doesn’t come with crackpot economic policies.

            <p>Your position is that there is a trade-off between government power and private-sector power. This is to some extent true, and it is something to worry about. But it’s not the only thing to worry about.</p>
            <p>
                There is a much more important trade-off entirely within the private sector, which is the division of power between competitive small business and non-competitive big-business. In the US, since 1980, the government has
                consistently sided with big business, and small business in the US is disappearing. The entire entrepreneurial class in the US is vanishing, stores are closing faster than they are opening (the total number of US businesses
                is actually decreasing today).
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the “four freedoms” that FDR laid out in his “second bill of rights” speech in 1945 is the freedom to start a business free of fear of monopolistic competition. This right has not been protected in the US, as large
                banks provide capital to large business to finance takeovers of city after city, replacing the small business economy of each city with homogenous national chains. There is nothing more efficient about Wal-Mart as compared
                to the thousands of stores that it replaced, except that they can pay slave wages, and they can get special deals with suppliers due to their size. These are anti-competitive practices, and there is no justification for
                allowing the economy of the US to become dominated by large corporations in this way.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reduction of power of large corporate entities used to be a top priority for Republicans, since Teddy Roosevelt, but it is now something only Democrats enforce. The goal of keeping the US business economy healthy is
                something that must appeal to anyone who cares about competition and innovation, because ALL innnovation comes from small firms, you just don’t know it, because those firms are bought out by large ones who bring the product
                to a larger market and reap the majority of the profits.
            </p>
            <p>Sanders advocates breaking up the big banks, and is favorable to anti-trust enforcement with teeth (as, to be fair, Martin O’Malley also said). There is no substitute for a competitive economy.</p>
            <p>
                I agree that government contracts are often used to exert undue power, which is why structural anti-trust mechanism need to be put in place. I personally favor a strongly graduated corporate income tax, whose rate rises with
                the total number of employees. This is an incentive for firms to split themselves up, just to make more money. This needs to be coupled with contract reform, to prevent false-splits, and to ensure fair pricing to small and
                large firms. Contracts are enforced by the government, and contract law is the most important law. Fair transparent contracting allows competition to form, and innovation to happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                While Sanders didn’t propose a graduated corporate tax, he does work for campaign finance reform, and it is hopeless to think that the power of big business can be opposed when big-business finances the election of
                congressional candidates.

                Those aren’t real choices— the deoderants you see in mainstream drug stores are the same exact product in 20 different plastic cases (look at the ingredients). There is no innovation from the large firms that package
                deoderant, they are enormous firms making a commodity product and repackaging it in different boxes to suit a tiered income population, designing it by advertizing that poor people buy cheap packages, and rich people buy the
                same product in a more expensive package, so as to maximize their profit. This type of pricing structure (when it was done in a more transparent form) was made illegal at one point, so now it is disguised by assuming the
                superficial facade of a different product.
            </p>
            <p>
                Real innovation doesn’t come from “free market capitalism”, not as it is practiced by large firms, it comes from competition. The lack of competition in US markets is appalling— I have no choice for internet, for clothing I
                must shop at large chains who buy from a limited number of distributors the products made overseas, for a bus, I must take Greyhound, for food I must go to a large national chain, for consumer electronics I am usually
                limited to a large chain, for every product you can imagine, there is a monopoly or near-monopoly in nearly every community.
            </p>
            <p>The true innovation comes from small business, and Bernie Sanders is the best friend small business in Vermont ever had. This is why he has 85% approval ratings, because he is good to capitalism in its functioning form.</p>

                destroyed innovation in the USSR, through undue power.

                The essential philosophy is reducing unemployment. All his policies fit within this theme. The market distortions of low aggregate demand are caused by competition with the unemployed, and in a zero unemployment situation,
                wages rise so that they are fair. To reduce unemployment there are several things you can do:
            </p>
            <p>1. INCREASE the minimum wage.</p>
            <p>
                Paradoxically, increasing the minimum wage decreases unemployment, as the extra employment provided by the spending offsets the expense to businesses due to extra wages. This paradoxical effect is something predicted by
                Keynes, observed routinely real-world, and denied and laughed at by Chicago school folks who predict the opposite.
            </p>
            <p>2. Subsidize college with free tuition</p>
            <p>This removes people from the labor force, and reintroduces them into the labor force in a better position.</p>
            <p>3. Progressive taxes</p>
            <p>This reverses the loss of demand due to monopolistic extraction of high wages by top management at corporations.</p>
            <p>4. Infrastructure jobs program</p>
            <p>And in addition, when there is still unemployment, you absorb the remaining labor into useful infrastructure jobs, which has the added benefit of improving quality of life and reducing costs of other business.</p>
            <p>
                The goal of reducing unemployment is also met by the Fed, but the Fed doesn’t do this anymore. Sanders wants pro-employment monetary policy. He also wants a bank-breakup to allow credit to small businesses that reduce
                unemployment. He is the “full employment” president, and this is the thing that is most necessary. It is not a surprise that economists endorse his platform.
            </p>
            <p>You think that economists go the opposite way than the way they actually do because you only see Chicago school quacks on TV. Real economists are Keyensians, and are fully on board with Sanders.</p>

                Yes, we need to talk about 9/11, but the event that was cancelled was not a discussion or a debate, or an investigation. It was a “memorial”, meaning it was remembering the outright propaganda without critical analysis.
                These lies were designed to blame Muslims, and therefore remembering this propaganda uncritically is simply a celebration of anti-Muslim hysteria. There is benefit in discussion and in criminal prosecutions, but that’s not
                what students would get offended at— I guarantee you that all these leftists would love to see Cheney on trial.

                Ron Paul is the only republican who was publically skeptical, but he did not advocate reducing anyone’s power, he was there for a “just in case” vote, in case the public becomes less stupid. In a modern society, there is a
                power problem from two directions, from big business that chokes up the economy, and from big government which can destroy initiative, and the collusion between them which can destroy everything in a puff of dust. Reducing
                the power of government while increasing the power of business is not a solution, neither is increasing the power of government while regulating monopolated business.
            </p>
            <p>
                The real solution is what people have done since the Roosevelts: use government taxes and lawsuits to break up big business and limit the accumulations of market power, make investments in R&amp;D and infrastructure to
                reduce unemployment to near zero, and otherwise keep government from being a nuisance. This combination is supported only by senator Bernie Sanders today, but it is still more or less the platform of the Democratic party, as
                it is the platform of ALL normal political parties, right or left, in Europe, in Asia, everywhere.

                I know you THINK that these Chicago school predictions are observed, but it is the exact opposite. Minimum wage has gone up several times, and each time, after a period of a few months to a year, the unemployment GOES DOWN
                in response, and significantly. This is explained each time by Chicago school economists as follows: “DESPITE raising minimum wage, business profits have increased sufficiently over the past quarter to compensate for the
                unemployment increase, and bring the unemployment down further than the wage pressure has brought it up…”
            </p>
            <p>
                The same thing regarding price rise during stimulus injections. When Russia just dumped money on its economy in the 90s, the Chicago school economists predicted 10-fold rises in prices. They predicted a doubling or tripling
                of prices in response to Obama’s Fed stimulus, in response to every quantitative easing. These predictions are quantitative, and COMPLETELY FALSE, not even a little bit, there is no price rise aside from business-as-usual
                inflation. In this case, the Chicago quacks don’t say anything, because there is nothing to say.
            </p>

                The “Chile miracle” is not a miracle, it is a catastrophe. The fascists took over, and the US pumped money into the country to make the system look good. The South American region only gained decent living standards when
                they voted in socialists or Keynesians, and this is a fact which your media lies to you about.
            </p>
            <p>When something happens consistently, in contradiction to your economic doctrine, you have to consider whether your doctrine is correct.</p>
            <p>
                The reason minimum wage hikes “coincidentally” happen just in time for economic growth which “cancels out” their unemployment effect is explained in Marxist or Keyensian economics (they are the same regarding this effect,
                but Marx was there first, Keyens is just ripping Marx off regarding this). The demand in an economy is too low because workers are chronically underpaid, as they complete with the unemployed. Workers equilibrium wage is when
                there is ZERO unemployment, and it is roughly equal to the productivity per worker, up to a small factor.
            </p>
            <p>
                This prediction is false when there are large hiring firms, and unemployment, and wages decline to zero. This WRECKS the economy, because demand collapses to zero, and there are no consumers for the products you can produce.
                Minimum wage raises therefore ALWAYS lead to LOWER unemployment (until the wage gets high enough to produce inflation), and this is the correct prediction, observed EVERY SINGLE GODDAMN TIME MINIMUM WAGE GOES UP.
            </p>
            <p>
                Likewise “creating money” doesn’t produce price inflation until the money gets in the pockets of workers in the form of wages, and starts to stress the productive capacity. As long as production is not maximum, inflation
                doesn’t take off. This is also what is observed EVERY SINGLE GODDAMN TIME there is quantitative easing.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you economic doctrine is wrong like this, in objectively measurable facts, you need to reject it. The funny thing is that this doctrine was rejected in 1936, when Keynesians took over, but somehow got REINSTATED by
                billionaires with think-tank funds, who don’t know anything about academic economics, only their own self-interest.

                it can do so with a bond sale, and it doesn’t matter if there is one buyer or 180. The advantages of size for banks are pure anti-competitive nonsense, nothing substantial.

                I am sorry, but you don’t get that monopolization is something that requires structural remedy. I don’t think that structural remedy has to be so invasive, a graduated corporate income tax is rather modest in terms of
                government interference, and I think this is immune from political considerations. But traditional trust-busting and directed legislation is necessary right now, when we don’t have a graduated tax. Trust busting was done by
                Teddy Roosevelt, and by both Democrats and Republicans, and it was not a political retribution system, it was really designed to produce competitive markets. It worked relatively poorly, as there were still monopolies that
                never got busted, but it was better than nothing.

                Sanders has the most educated economic policy of any candidate, the problem is that you have a false understanding of economics, produced by bought-out professionals who don’t tell the truth. The field of economics is very
                politically loaded, and right-wing think tanks have installed Chicago-school quacks in many departments, who pretend to know what they are talking about. They don’t, and you can see this because all their objective
                predictions are completely wrong (for example, their predictions of inflation response to stimulus, their prediction of unemployment when minimum wage goes up, etc). The Keynsians get the right answers empirically, because
                their economics is sound.

                the public blames a whole ethnic group for the crime, an ethnic group none of whose members had anything to do with it. Then the event itself becomes a problem of bigotry, even though there is a victim who was murdered, and

                When a corporation is small, it is regulated by competition, it cannot influence Congress directly, and it can’t damage the economy at all, it can just go out of business. While you still need a certain amount of regulation,
                it is much less when business is competitive, as real competition is a good regulator. The rise of enormous business in the US is something relatively recent, there was a healthy small business economy as late as the 1990s.
                I support Bernie Sanders because he has the right target in his sights— the enormous banks, large multinationals, those that make business in the US difficult or impossible for those who wish to compete in a fair market.

                against certain figures of the last decade, those in government who shredded constitutional law and those in investment banking who defrauded institutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                He has the power to appoint do-nothing figures to homeland security, to start to disintegrate that abomination, he has the power to divert military spending to civilian-useful research projects like LFTR, and he has the
                power to clear out the corrupted regulators who prevent business from being competitive. As mayor, he was able to keep Burlington friendly to small business, and a president has enough power to help small business overall.
                When Clinton was president, even though he was friendly to big-business, he overall steered the internet economy toward many small businesses through bipartisan deregulation policy.

                A real leftist president has a lot of angles through which to take action. It is tough, you can’t do everything, but you can start. Prosecutions change public opinion, and really send a jolt of pressure into the power
                structures, as people genuinely start to respect the law again, and see it as applying to them. You won’t get a Bybee approving torture again, or some random NSA evesdropping.

                Those same people who are stupid enough to listen to talk radio are also stupid enough to follow a random leftist, when the political wind shifts. They are not stable, they say whatever they think will make them more
                popular. The right wing mob is acting against its own interest, it is brainwashed by old media propaganda, but all that old-media generation is old. The internet has enough resources to get people to think for themselves,
                and younger folks don’t get their propaganda from corporate TV.

                The actual reforms at home began with Civil War Republicans, half of whom were directly reading and responding to Marx, when he was a current figure. They got off the gold standard and instituted paper money for a while,
                made real universal male suffrage, opposed big banking and big cotton, and supported northern industrial workers and businessmen both. Later on, they dropped the workers and the Democrats picked them up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Marx himself was writing a lot about the US for US papers. Thaddeus Stevens and the other radical Republicans were mostly out-and-out Marxists, in the sense of “agreeing with what Karl Marx was saying”, meaning what Karl
                Marx actually wrote in the 19th century, as it was understood in the 19th century. That’s not Lenin, it’s what we would call Keyensianism today. Marxist thought became more statist and totalitarian later (although it had
                elements of this from the beginning, following the furthest-left economic planning advocates who took part in the French revolution).
            </p>
            <p>
                The reforms were a compromise between the Marxist radical Republicans and the somewhat more powerful pro-business republicans. In the 20th century, labor unions in the US rejected Marxism as it became more statist, the
                democratic socialists split off, and they hitched themselves first to American labor unions, and then to the Democratic party in the 1920s, when the Republicans switched to be a pure laissez-faire party.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m just saying this to point out that Karl Marx is not two four letter words. Keynsianism is the distillation of those parts of Marxism that were no longer controversial in 1933, and it is now the standard economic
                doctrine, or rather, would be, except for some amount of US amnesia.

                Regarding trusts and investing, I didn’t know that regulation— I don’t know how you could enforce such a thing, as an investor could just contract out another individual to invest for them in another trust. The trust-busting
                efforts were the first real successful reform, and used to be considered the crowning Republican success, but now even Democrats don’t make efforts in this direction anymore. The banking consolidation of credit started under
                Reagan, but completed under Clinton.

                Sanders socially sensible policy is also sensible economic policy, it’s based on a theme of reducing unemployment and raising wages. That’s a theme that economists have forgotten, due to their selective amnesia toward all

                The productivity is the GDP divided by the population, and it is much greater than $40 an hour, it is more like double this. The point of redistributive taxation is to remove non-competitive concentrations of money, that
                block economic productivity.

                Chinese labor does not get 11 cents an hour, you have never been to china, but they get about 10% of comparable American labor. This is a problem that can be fixed by better trade deals that require higher wages for foreign
                employees, and provide incentives for local Chinese industry, rather than for a takeover by foreign multinationals.

            <p>
                Further, all loans, student loans or credit card loans, are far more secure now after bankruptcy reforms, which prevent people from defaulting. But this has not brought the interest rate down, because credit in the US is
                monopolized. This is due to consolidation in banks.

            <p>
                The policy of reducing student loan rates is to reduce unemployment doubly, both because students are out of the labor pool while studying, and also because they qualify for better jobs when they come out. Policies that
                produce employment are sensible and lift wages, and are opposed by those on the right for no good reason.

            <p>I didn’t see the movie yet, I read the book a long time ago. I wasn’t sure if the fundamental idea came across, but it looks like it did.</p>
            <p>
                It’s a philosophy. I am not a person who holds this philosophy, but as a leftist, I think we need to explain exactly how it fails, as Marx did, and others later. There is a lot of hidden merit in this philosophy of
                unregulated markets, that is, if you believe there are only two alternatives— a private sector which is unregulated, or else a top-down bureaucratic government heirarchy saying what you can and can’t do, to the point that
                you can’t do anything new (like the Terry Gilliam movie Brazil, or the former Soviet Union). Conservatives prioritize freedom of action over stability and common-sense, and I think one should make leftist thinking compatible
                with this philosophy.
            </p>
            <p>
                While superficially, it seems that it is impossible to regulate and deregulate at the same time, there are alternatives to traditional regulation which are disfavored because they give less power to the regulating agency. I
                like to call such proposals “nonbureaucratic socialism”, but you know, call it what you like. The idea here is to regulate using structural incentives. An example is cap-and-trade tax policy to control global warming. The
                overall policy is set at the top, but the details are left to the individuals who make purchasing decisions. It is a minimally invasive way to produce public benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think that there is a lot of unexplored potential in this approach. For example, enforcing anti-trust law requires complex lawsuits, and regulators looking over all aspects of a large business, to find opportunities for a
                split. I believe that this can be replaced with a structural graduated corporate income tax, where the tax rate rises with the number of employees (as this is the size of the control structure). With a steep enough tax, you
                induce companies to split naturally, simply to save money. If you adjust the tax to be revenue neutral, it just transfers wealth from large to small firms, to compensate equalize their political power.
            </p>
            <p>
                To make such a proposal work, it needs to come with a transparent contract and pricing law for inter-corporate trade. This is to prevent companies from falsely claiming a split, where none actually happens. The way to do
                this is to require that contracts between companies need to be published, and need to explicitly take the form of a service contract, a fee-for-service, or secrecy-for-knowledge sort of exchange. The government enforces
                contracts, so it can specify the language precisely. Such contracts must not be exclusive, except to the degree that you purchase guaranteed supply for a fixed period at a fixed price. Each contract need to be open to
                outside bids, so that others can buy the same service for the same period, All such contracts need to be published online to be enforced, and must use boilerplate language (the standard language aspect is already de-facto
                required by corporate lawyers, and the enormous uniform commerciial code acts— this type of policy replaces such regulation with simpler regulation achieving more).
            </p>
            <p>It should be forbidden to own equity in a publically traded company you run, or have any say over. This is a form of insider trading, that is responsible for the gross pay distortions.</p>
            <p>
                With these three policies, you can break up American business natually into smaller businesses that cooperate through transparent, publishe, public contracts, instead of monolithic box stores and giant corporate chains. Most
                of the gains of mergers and acquisitions can be gained instead by subcontracting the overlapping service to a company that serves both large entities that are merging. The efficiencies are illusiary.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal here is a decentralized economy approximating the free-market ideal of maximal competition. Under such circumstances, it is much more difficult to have a situation like the financial meltdown, because markets become
                more self-regulating the more actors there are, and the less power each individual actors can have. I support Sanders, at least he wants to break up the big banks, which is a step in this direction.

                This idiotic narrative not only blames poor people for a banker’s problem, it misses the whole point of the collapse— it’s not that poor people were getting loans they couldn’t pay back, that’s not a problem, the risk of
                default is accounted for in the risk model. The issue is that when housing prices started dropping, the collateral was worth less than the loan. It makes no sense to pay a $200,000 mortgage on a house that is now worth only
                $180,000, whether you are rich or poor. Either way, you are better off defaulting on the house, cutting your losses on the declining property, and perhaps buy the house back from the bank at the lower price.
            </p>
            <p>
                This correlated default is the predictable event that made the mortgage securities ridiculous. The folks insuring these assumed the defaults were independent events, and they either didn’t notice that the defaults could all
                happen at the same time under a rather predictable situation, or else were pressured to look the other way. Other people noticed that the insurance rating was nonsense, and those people at Goldman Sachs took bets against the
                mortgage bundles.
            </p>
            <p>
                So it is doubly idiotic to blame poor people, and it is triply idiotic to blame government policies encouraging home-ownership. The issue is the ratings agency issuing bad ratings to bundles based on a bogus assumption of
                statistical independence.

            <p>It’s stupid because turning heat energy to power is a standard procedure, and you can use any liquid to do it, not just water. Energy is energy.</p>
            <p>
                Nuclear power is complex, sure, because it emits no CO2 and uses a fuel with a million times more energy density, a fuel that doesn’t ever run out. The arguments against are due to the current bad designs, which produced 300
                times too much waste 300 times too long lived, and were made by bureaucrats, not scientists. There is no argument against LFTRs, which are just better in every way.

            <p>
                Even with current risks, the chance of a radiation spill is insignificant danger compared to the certain catastrophe that is global warming. But the risks can be reduced more, so that the number of spills is less than 1 per
                century. That’s manageable, and it won’t destroy the planet, but of course you want to have zero accident potential. That’s much more likely with a LFTR than with a light water pants.

        <div>
            <p>It’s much more complex, because it is using a fuel with 1,000,000 times the energy density. This is a ridiculous argument.</p>
            <p>
                The only serious argument against nuclear power is the waste, and the waste is due to light water reactor design. Waste is taken care of with a breeder that uses up all the fissile fuel, either a LFTR or a fast-neutron
                reactor that makes plutonium. Once you have those running (and they work), the waste is reduced in volume by a factor of 300, and in lifetime by another factor of 300, and it becomes completely manageable forever.

                Except that fusion reaction is only kept stable by the gravity of the sun’s mass. To produce the same pressures on Earth, you need either a tokamak or the ablation power of a plutonium explosion. We can’t get tokamaks to
                work properly because of magnetic field instabilities, it’s hard to squeeze gas with a magnetic field. Tokamaks will not be competitive. But plutonium bombs are cheap, you can make a 200 kiloton bomb for 200 kilodollars,
                that’s a dollar per ton in terms of fossil fuel equivalent (more expensive than Thorium, but much less expensive than coal in terms of fuel costs).
            </p>
            <p>
                The sun’s energy is used to run plant life on Earth. If you capture a grown percentage of the sun’s energy for human use, you will blight the environment with thousands of square miles of collection panels, or engineered
                environments. Rooftop panels are good for areas with sprawl, but sprawl itself should be reduced, and when we live on minimal land, the area is not enough for solar. Not to mention that solar is intermittent.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are talking about a far-future scenario, where we build a Dyson sphere, ok, that’s interesting. But you need to store the energy you collect in a reasonable form. Thorium and Uranium are pre-stored energy from past
                transmutations, and are energy dense enough to power civilization as we know it forever. Fusion is even better, but it is uneconomical right now, except through fusion bombs, which people are scared of.
            </p>
            <p>
                The issue with waste is solved by good breeders, like the LFTR Thorium plant. Breeders can also use Uranium in a fast reactor, and these produce a truly minimal amount of waste. The problem with nuclear power is our current
                crappy unimaginative design, which uses 1 part in 400 of the energy content, and leaves the whole rod behind as 10,000 year waste. That’s the worst possible nuclear solution, and it can be replaced by breeders and LFTRs that
                use 100% of the energy, and leave behind 300 year waste.
            </p>
            <p>
                300 year waste, at the small volumes you produce from total usage, can be stored for the entire 300 years with something comparable to the storage we already have, maybe twice that, but not too much more. That means it is
                economical from beginning to end, and doesn’t accumulate garbage. That makes it better than our plastics industry, or our consumer products industries, which accumulate garbage without end.
            </p>
            <p>
                The modern nuclear power plants are entirely environmentally friendly, and must be supported by environmentalists. They require political push to extend existing light-water plants with new LFTRs and breeders, which right
                now are experimental, and only in other countries. The US developed these first, they just aren’t the leaders anymore. Europe, India, and China are.

                The 19th century scientific definition of a unit of energy was “the quantity required to raise the temperature of a gram of water 1 degree”, this is the calorie, and it’s 4.18 Joules. This definition is equivalent to any

                It would fit in a basement, but that’s not the proper method. You need to burn up all the fissionable material, and store the resulting pure fission-products for the 300 years they remain radioactive. That’s not unreasonably

                The current spent fuel strategy with light water reactors is unsustainable. But that’s with the old designs. If the fuel is completely used up in a modern reactor, a fast breeder, or a Thorium reactor, the waste is all
                fission products, it’s very small in volume, 200 times less volume than current waste, and only radioactive for 300 years, not 10,000 years. That can be accomodated by existing storage facilities, or perhaps double that,
                indefinitely. You can deal with a 300 year problem, not with a 10,000 year problem 200 times bigger.

                There is no shortage of fuel, and there never will be. Even with Uranium, and with the current terrible waste, fuel costs are not significant, and you can mine terrible ores and still generate energy. With LFTR (Thorium
                reactors), you will never run out of cheap fuel. The real issue is waste, and for this only fast-breeders and LFTRs solve the problem, but these are expensive to develop and deploy, so they were shelved for decades. Not
                anymore. Once you have Throium reactors and breeders, the old complaints about waste management will be moot, as fission products only need to be stored for a relatively short period of 300 years. That is not unmanageable,
                considering the volume of the waste is 400 times smaller when you use up all the fissionable fuel, the waste is economically valuable, and 300 years is not effectively infinite, unlike 10,000 years. The current storage
                facilities will in volume terms be enough for breeder and LFTR waste.

                That’s really total nonsense— there’s plenty of uranium. It’s impossible to run out in a reasonable time-frame, because fuel costs are not a significant factor in running a nuclear plant, and you can extract Uranium from as
                low density ore as you like. It gets more expensive, but the expense of fuel is negligible— you need so little of it. So even when you run out of the cheap ore, and the costs rise by a factor of 10 or 100, it won’t matter at
                all. The only issue is waste storage and disposal, which is unsustainable with current designs, but which is addressed by more modern designs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The waste issue is solved by fast neutron reactors and breeders. The current nuclear designs are no good, and leave behind waste for 10,000 years. Breeder designs use up all the fissionable elements, and leave behind only
                fission products, which are economically valuable waste, which runs out of radioactivity after only 200-300 years, which is an entirely manageable time frame for storage, considering how little waste there would be
                comparatively, if you have only fission products. The current storage facilities would be nearly enough forever, because they are now storing “waste” which is really 99.5% fuel for a breeder.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Liquid Flouride Thorium Reactor is an even better design. But these are only now being tried, they were shelved for decades. Once you have LFTRs and commercial breeders, you have abundant energy, because we really will
                never run out of thorium. With the breeders, you dispose of the existing waste as fuel. But US research on these topics has stalled, due to political bureaucratic nonsense.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea that wind and solar will solve the problem by themselves is absurd. They can only deal with at most 50% of the energy, because there is no good way to store the energy without loss. Even at 50%, wind and solar will
                bring more severe environmental problems than nuclear, you are going to blight large areas with wind-farms and solar panels.
            </p>
            <p>Newer reactors should be completely safe, the LFTR can’t melt down, but even if there is an accident per century, one must deal with it, rather than face the certainty of more global warming.</p>

                After that bill was passed, I remember things appearing, like pre-paid phone cards and hundreds of little phone-service companies, and that reduced prices for about 6 years, until wireless took over. The deregulation aspect
                was to separate the infrastructure from the service, and I wish they did the same thing with wireless and cable, because they are now just like AT&amp;T was, except completely unregulated monopolies like Time-Warner Cable or
                near-monopolies, like Verizon.
            </p>
            <p>
                The situation for small phone-service companies and internet ISPs was, I think, quite good under the last years of Clinton. I remember there being a healthy competitive market in both, with lots of new small firms, until the
                consolidation wave of the last decade, which wrecked that part of the industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think that i you strip away the repeal of media-ownership restrictions, the competitive parts of the bill were really good, and can serve as a model. The consolidation of media needs be fought as well, but that was, I
                thought, a bone to throw to conservatives, to support the pro-competition aspects of the bill— it’s not what I remember the main effect of the 1996 act as being.
            </p>
            <p>
                I personally favor a different way of fighting consolidation— via a graduated corporate income tax based on the number of employees, so as to make a strong structural incentive for firms to split up, without direct lawsuits
                and interventions by government. If you keep businesses small and dynamic, you don’t have to worry about this mass of consolidation and takeovers But this proposal I think is original, nobody suggests it in either party.

                The water is only used for thermal transfer and cooling, if you thermally cycle liquid salt, cool it with a radiator, or use some other cooling strategy, other than taking millions of gallons of water through the pipes
                carrying too-hot water, you don’t need to dump warm water. This is something that is different in every reactor design, only current designs use tons of water, and the only reason they use tons of water is to reduce the
                thermal impact of the hot water coming out, so that it’s not that much hotter than the environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I really think the main thing is anachronistic fears of nuclear annihilation, and atom bomb proliferation. Nuclear weapons are a nation-state game, and if nation-states agree not to build them for military purposes, then
                they just won’t get built. Nobody else other than a nation-state can afford to build even the stupidest design, like the Hiroshima bomb.

            <p>
                Global warming is now the top danger. Radiation spills are awful, but their impact is minimal, and hopefully we can reduce the number of accidents far below the 3 per half-century we had this last century. I think 1 per
                century is acceptable risk, but it should be less than that with a good placement scheme. With the appropriate reactor design, a breach shouldn’t be as catastrophic as that Japanese breach, which literally was the worst
                possible thing— it exposed the liquid at the reactor core to the open sea! That’s idiotic, and whoever put the reactor there right by the ocean on an earthquake zone has a lot of explaining to do.

                Didn’t that separate infrastructure and service, like the AT&amp;T breakup in 1984? That’s what I remember of that bill, although I might be misremembering. It might have also removed anti-consolidation regulation, which is
                bad, but I believe Clinton/Gore and Co. suspected it wouldn’t be important, because the internet would take over. The most important thing is competitive internet, and right now, the cable monopolies have an internet
                monopoly, which is what I understood the 1996 act was supposed to avoid.

                It doesn’t matter how they feel, it matters how we think. Nuclear power is the obvious carbon-neutral solution to energy, the energy density of nuclear fuel is millions of times greater than any chemical fuel, and the
                radiation risk can be reduced. I don’t think it needs to be reduced, as the risk of an occasional radiation spill is bad, but nowhere near as bad as the certainty of global warming.
            </p>
            <p>
                France has been nearly entirely nuclear for a while now, and they have the most innovative reactor designs. Nuclear engineering is a wide-open field, it has a lot of unused ideas. Nuclear power right now produces a larger
                amount of waste than it should, because you only use the naturally fissile .007 of natural Uranium, the bulk is not used to breed fissile fuel, probably because of proliferation fears. There are reactors that breed
                plutonium, reactors that use Thorium, these are much more efficient, and allow you to cycle the waste in to reduce it’s radioactivity.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is even a realistic and economical FUSION reactor, using no new technology, which explodes small hydrogen bombs to heat up big vats of liquid salt. This is the “PACER” nuclear power plant, and it was never tested, due
                to atom-bomb fears. Those fears were justified during the cold war, they are anachronistic now that global warming rather than nuclear war is the top threat.
            </p>
            <p>If you are so concerned about accidents, put the radioactive part of the reactor underground, or in an isolated area. I am not worried about this.</p>

                “simulated” crashing them into buildings, and are easy to manipulate into a false flag. You also need to look up the one person in charge of all those military exercises. There is no compromise possible with such an issue.

                Time Warner cable is an infrastructure monopoly, and they didn’t use government regulations to get the monopoly exactly, rather they hijacked their pre-existing cable lines to get an internet monopoly by offering faster
                speeds through those cables at (temporarily) lower prices than other ISPs (if I am getting it right). Once the other ISPs were out of business, rates crept up, and service quality declined. Regulations have very little to do
                with monopolization, the regulations come after the fact. It was a privately set up infrastructure monopoly, as usual in such cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way monopolies happen is through mergers and acquisition, followed by snapping up all the essential infrastructure under one management. This is what happens in all such cases, and it is an outright delusion to say it is
                done by the government or by regulations. It is done by private corporations.
            </p>
            <p>
                One obvious solution is an anti-trust action against TW to separate the cables from the service, and allow internet service companies to rent the cable infrastructure. But anti-trust needs to be done on a case by case basis.
                There are other monopolies which will never get sued— like Greyhound and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe in a uniform solution to the monopoly problem, which is a progressive corporate income tax. This will produce the results structurally and naturally, without and of that heavy handed intervention or regulation, or
                lawsuits.

            <p>NO REGULATIONS! I didn’t say anything about regulations. I agree with you about regulations, I dislike regulations tremendously for the exact same reasons you say.</p>
            <p>A graduated corporate income tax is not a regulation. It’s not ME breaking up the company. I don’t know anything about the company. It’s a parametrized formula of the nature</p>
            <p>marginal rate = – .01 + .05 * ( # of employees /100)^(.5)</p>
            <p>where the set rate applies uniformly to every income dollar. It is set by the social price of having a heirarchical command organization, and the social price of influencing politics.</p>
            <p>If you want to build a big business, just PAY THE HIGHER TAX, it’s the price you pay for being big.</p>
            <p>
                The goal is to get the companies themselves to think about how to split, not the government. There’s no imposition in terms of detail, there’s no imposition at all, pay a 30% tax, you just won’t be able to compete with a
                divided up collection of smaller entities paying 15% tax.
            </p>
            <p>
                The advantages that come from size are all anti-competitive advantages— easier negotiation with large governments that small business can’t do, lower mean wages for employees, wages low enough that a small business owner
                can’t impose them on himself or herself, low contract prices due to special negotiations with other large entities. These are all contrary to efficient market operation, and whatever advantage a big firm has should be
                uniformly available to small firms too. If you want special size advantages, pay the higher marginal rate appropriate to your size, your anti-competitive advantage will be more than neutralized, and you had better have a
                real efficiency reason that justifies your company being big.
            </p>
            <p>
                The coordination of business, and the selection of leaders, this is something that I don’t have anything to say about. Management and vision can be contracted out to the board of directors, now an independent firm, whose
                managerial decisions and vision are sent as documents, and which negotiate for themselves a nice 5 figure salary in exchange for their documents. A really visionary firm, that makes brilliant decisions, they make more money
                for the collection of companies they run, they can negotiate more money. That’s a competitive management for 100 firms all together, it’s not a board of directors skimming the profits from a multinational.

                The collapse of the USSR was the worst catastrophe in your lifetime, and it must never happen in China. Russia went from a country of engineers and astronauts to a den of gangsters and drug-fiends, it was “Mad Max”, and
                millions of people died, of drug overdoses, from lost health-care, and in dire poverty that you can’t even imagine. Russia’s life-expectancy was around 50 in the 1990s. When a country’s industrial output collapses by half
                it’s not just the leadership that suffers, it’s the whole country. China did their transition to capitalism over the past 40 years, without any collapse, and without an oligarchy taking over. Now China is afraid of
                democracy, because they don’t want a collapse of the same sort.

                It is a mistake to think that you need one unified company to do international operations. If you have a split up Exxon, or something, it becomes a loose agglomeration of 700 independent companies with interlocking supply
                contracts, and then a small international division is contracted by the 700 companies to run the oversees wells and to return the sell-profits via contractual obligation to the child companies. Exxon can entirely replace
                this part without touching any other part, just by contracting with a competitor, and conversely, if you’re one of the 400 newly split Shell oil divisions, can ask for the same service from the same formerly Exxon company
                for your foreign wells. It reduces a lot of redundancy and inefficiency in parallel large firms, you get the same exact efficiencies that people usually claim for large mergers and acquisitions, reducing duplicate
                bureaucracies,except without the merger. It’s the exact opposite of merger, it’s atomization. The parallel bureaucracies would now not be parallel insulated inner parts of large companies, but competing independent

                have to do everything at once, they can cooperate, and they are small enough that new programs can easily compete. It’s also like shared libraries or browser containers— you don’t need a separate video rendering library for

                It’s what I said 20 years ago too. And I still say it today, and I’ll say it until it’s complete and there’s no need to say it anymore. Linux progress is steady and inevitable, because Linux comes with a ratchet— there’s no
                going back. 20 years ago, you wouldn’t find many CS undergrads running Linux, Microsoft was busy sponsoring CS departments with Windows-only computer rooms, to replace legacy Unix machines (they succeeded in displacing Unix
                much like Linux is succeeding in displacing Windows today).

            <p>
                Regarding the philosophy: I’m NOT talking about individual income taxes— I’m talking about a GRADUATED CORPORATE income tax where the rate rises sharply with the number of employees. This is NOT for revenue, it’s just to
                encourage companies to split up.
            </p>
            <p>
                With such a tax, a firm with 10,000 employees has a financial incentive to split up its divisions into firms with 1,000 employees. That solves the monopoly problem for good, and without any government intervention. I’m
                proposing this as a REPLACEMENT for the Sherman act, I don’t think you need anti-trust law if you have a steeply enough graduated corporate income tax. It doesn’t even need to be that steep before it’s an incentive to split.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem with such a law is skirting it by phony splits. You do nothing, but claim your hardware division is independent. The way around this is to require open contracting laws to show the inputs and outputs to
                independent business, and to standardize purchases of service contracts, so that anyone can contract with an independent firm at the same price. This means that the split firms become genuinely independent.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third policy I propose is “no insider equity”, nobody working in a publically traded firm can own equity in the firm. This is obviously for publically traded firm. This is a much easier way to avoid insider trading, and
                it also prevents absurd concentrations of wealth by management options packages.
            </p>
            <p>
                These form a coherent philosophy, with concrete proposals. The idea is to produce effects like the telecom deregulation act of 1996 without the constant selective government litigation. With these tax incentives, the
                companies will do it themselves, as it will bring in money.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason Microsoft was attacked and Google was not is because Clinton enforced anti-trust (half-heartedly), while Bush did not. It’s as simple as that. Bush also dropped the Microsoft suit, which was just the first of his
                many atrocious policies.

                A carbon tax is not a good progressive thing, it’s a terribly regressive tax by itself. But it is necessary so as to give an incentive to reduce carbon emissions. This is not opening Pandora’s box, it’s adding a tax to
                reorganize production.

                I asked some students at the CS department at Columbia what fractions of undergrads run linux on their computers, and according to the two of them, it’s the majority of the undergrads. The departments don’t get it, but the
                students do, so I am not worried about Linux adoption, it’s always slow and steady, but it’s inevitable.

                I understand your fantasy about government and leftists colluding with big business, but it’s not at all true. Microsoft achieved market domination by making a deal with both IBM and Apple to provide Dos and AppleSoft Basic.
                The software itself was purchased and modified, the monopoly was due to pre-installation, and it was entirely done by private businesses. The only pause was when Al Gore tried to bust them in the late 1990s, but Bush stopped
                the anti-trust case.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was no “search engine standardization law” or “search database tax break” when Google became financed to monopoly status, it happened through the market. Likewise, WalMart is not aided by leftists, neither are Apple,
                Oracle, or any of the other large firms. They are in bed with government only after they are monopolies, and neither Microsoft nor Google care about government very much at all to date, and IBM only cared when it was a
                regulated firm.
            </p>

                I know it contradicts your philosophy, but doesn’t the long list of failed counterexamples demonstrate that your philosophy is entirely wrong? Couldn’t the production of large business have nothing to do with government, but
                have everything to do with the influx of large private concentrations of capital flowing into a company, usually at IPO time (as in the case of Google)?

                In order to maintain competition, you need structural incentives to break firms up, and, in my opinion, a strongly graduated corporate income tax whose rate goes up with the number of employees, this is the way to do it.
                It’s not something Bernie Sanders proposes, he supports old-fasioned anti-trust regulation, with all it’s years of litigation, and problems, but I think this is the easiest structural way to favor small firms. A modified
                contract law, requiring openness and uniform pricing, can ensure that ostensibly independent firms are truly independent. Such a law will set off an orgy of splits, as companies reorganize to save money. Then it will allow
                small competitors to the micro-companies that are spun off, as the competitors take over the contracts. It will also allow Apple’s software division to coordinate with hardware makers to end the absurd hardware monopoly
                Apple enforces through size.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tendency to monopoly is inherent in capitalism. You can get rid of it by structural incentives, or else you can force restructuring after it happens by heavy-handed government intervention. In the case of Verizon and
                Time Warner Cable, it is clear that the infrastructure parts (which is what the monopoly rides on) will have to get split from the service parts, and the infrastructure company will have to lease the towers/cables to any
                service company at the same rate. This is the model of the successful 1996 telecom deregulation act, which worked great for the 6 years before wireless and cable took over everything, just to sidestep it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think the 1996 act was great legislation, and it can be a model, but it’s absurd that the government needs to step in to do it. A simple tax incentive to split can ensure that the infrastructure splits from the service
                when the company gets large, and a simple uniform contracting law can ensure that a new service company can lease the same infrastructure, and not only for telecommunications, but for all aspects of the economy. I don’t
                think you have given much thought to what regulations which disfavor large businesses can do, as you are so used to a corrupt government bought out by large entities. That’s not how government is supposed to work, and it’s
                not how government works when it works right.

                The threat is a media concocted illusion. The notion of “ummah” and “sharia” is no different from “jewish nation” and “halachah”, or “Christendom” and “body of Christ”. They are personal things that are none of your
                business. “Jihad” is the Muslim version of “Tikkun Olam”, it’s something from a motivation speech.

                The claim is that there is an organized group out there who want it to mean something else, and they have an army of “radicalized Muslims” at their command. I’m sorry, but I can’t find any radicalized Muslims, and that’s
                after a search. If you find some, go and talk to them and see what they believe, and not online, through personal connections, because you can find people pretending to be radicalized on twitter and in various comments of
                certain discussions. I just don’t believe they are sincere.

                There’s nothing wrong with what you do, I just want to point out that if the minimum wage is higher, the chain stores are at a competitive disadvantage compared to small business, because half their gains are from bad wages.
                If there is a strong jobs program, big business is at a disadvantage, because nobody wants to work there. They make money off the savings that bad wages allow, and off a consumer base that is so poor that it must buy their
                low priced shoddy products.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other half of their gains come from predatory contracts, where they manipulate suppliers using their size to get a better deal. The way to fight that on the government end is to make sure that there are tough contract
                laws, and uniform pricing laws regarding businesses, so that dumping and predatory pricing to bankrupt competitors are regulated by lawsuits. Under conditions of fair competition, the chain stores are not profitable compared
                to small businesses, and they go under. That’s what Bernie Sanders does, and his defense of the small businessman is why I support his presidential bid.
            </p>

                I am not interested in personal power, or personal wealth. I am interested in being able to go to a store and not have to buy lousy products under homogenous flourescent lights from a goddamn chain staffed by slaves. I don’t
                shop at national chains, that’s why I have to live in New York City, which is the last place where small business is healthy. Except it’s not so healthy anymore— the local optometrist who owned his own shop closed a few
                years ago, and the service was replaced by “Cohen Fasion Optical” (a lousy national chain), the clothing stores closed a long time ago, now it’s all “Gap” and “Urban Outfitter”, and “Payless”. The local coffee shops are

                Time Warner Cable is internet. I don’t have TV services. There is no other choice for high speed internet. Also, I don’t consider satellite as competition for cable TV. I consider competition to be 20 small local firms that
                will provide you with actual cable service. Time Warner is an out and out monopoly. Nobody enforces anti-trust law anymore, and they haven’t really for decades.

                The way in which oligrarchies form is by replacing small business with big business, replacing free labor with hired wage labor, and putting all the economy under the control of a handful of companies. The whole US is now

                The whole modern US economy is dying. Large corporations are taking over diverse markets, destroying the economy by destroying the diversity of the economic ecosystem. Google became a monopoly and gobbled up all the little

                speeds. I also noticed that I have to take Greyhound to take a bus between cities, no other option, and they charge me obscene rates per mile, compared with Israel or Europe. I notice that every store in the suburban
                community I am spending new-year’s eve at is a chain store, pretty much all local business is gone. I notice that small business in Manhattan is disappearing, and being replaced by chain stores. Further, I notice the income

                I don’t accept a ruling class of altruistic experts. What I accept is a uniform highly progressive tax code which is designed to structurally divide up power naturally, without bureaucratic meddling. That’s my preferred way
                of dealing with large corporations— adjust the tax code to give them a large incentive to split up. Small companies are more innovative, and respond to market conditions, and also allow workers a say in how they are run.
                There is no reason to have top-down corporate bureaucracies, 9 times out of 10, they are just a waste of money, designed to suck profits into the pockets of the oligarchs at the top of the pyramid. Tax incentives can break
                these monstrosities up.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t trust experts or bureaucrats to micromanage complex ecosystems of economic behavior. I trust them to set a reasonable number— like the interest rates, or tax progressiveness factor, so as to best hit an economic
                target, to adjust the market to optimal operating position.

                I don’t expect the government to look into every business to see what people are doing. I expect the government to be clear about which contracts it is ready to enforce, and which it is not ready to enforce, and to make sure
                that the contracts that it is willing to enforce are uniformly fair to those who purchase, so that nobody is getting a better deal because of their size.

            <p>
                I don’t trust government to pay everyone’s salary, but I do trust government to do it’s best to set a number, the minimum wage, at the magical point between unemployment and inflation. I also trust that the government can
                temporarily provide construction jobs in regions where the market fails to do so, by hiring firms by lowest bid.

                There are some things one, as an anarchic-leaning leftist, doesn’t trust a ruling class to do, namely to tell other individual people what to do. But you can adjust macro policy to produce the outcome naturally, through
                incentives. There is nothing wrong with macro-policy, it is not the same thing as top-down planning, it produces a structural incentive. This is the key compromise which allows decentralization.

                The model example for me is the Linux kernel, where the top-down management structure simply audits code for efficiency and correctness (two objective markers) and the remaining decisions are made on an individual level.
                Linux kernel development is the model for the ideal society of the future, it is the best thing you have ever seen, and it is as far different from both the corporate US or the statist USSR as both of these are different
                from each other.

            <p>The tax is there as an incentive to reduce emissions, to make alternative energy more efficient. I think one can do it as follows (again, I haven’t thought about it as deeply as others, I’m making it up as I go along):</p>
            <p>
                1. reduce sprawl— one large component of CO2 emissions is excessive driving. I think anti-sprawl zoning can reduce carbon and increase quality of life. It also benefits small business relative to box-stores, increasing
                economic diversification and freedom. You also can increase CAFE standards, and make incentives for smaller and lighter cars
            </p>
            <p>
                2. nuclear power— I favor the “crazy” option of PACER fusion, but even liquid reactors that use Thorium, and fast-reactors and breeders that use up the naturally non-fissile component of Uranium are good enough to meet
                energy needs for hundreds of years. All the large polluters are already nuclear powers, and can transition as new designs are made available.

            <p>3. renewables— this can produce something like 40% of electricity, I think.</p>
            <p>4. reforestation— this is accounted for in some cap and trade, it preserves wilderness and is an incentive to leave the country’s recognizable wildernesses wild, rather than turn them into strip malls.</p>
            <p>
                5. R&amp;D — there are lots of unexplored options in nuclear engineering, and geothermal engineering. The USSR had deep boreholes that can be used for generating power. You can make photosynthetic algae produce gasoline by
                engineering their proteins to generate, that’s a renewable source of carbon fuel which is carbon neutral. This type of R&amp;D investment is generally good for economic growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you produce a carbon neutral economy, other nations will copy it. I think the US should be a leader here. Don’t pretend that the current US way of life is so great, most Americans spend half their life driving to and
                from places, and live in total isolation, due to the vast distances between any sort of place to go. So you gather at a mall instead of in a local square. I think you underestimate the degree to which a moderate incentive
                can increase the quality of life, without bureaucratic oversight, just by a financial incentive to reduce carbon emissions.
            </p>
            <p>These ideas are off the cuff, I am sure someone who knows more will say something more profound.</p>

                I don’t know, I’m not an expert, or involved in the groups. All I got from ICCC models was that the water-vapor warming is about an extra factor of 10 from the warming predicted by CO2 alone, and everything else you can
                ignore. I bet you can get that water-vapor figure just from ocean evaporation, without using a computer, but I am not sure, as they do all sorts of complicated stuff that I can’t check. The factor of 10 (don’t quote me on
                the exact factor— it’s a ballpark thing) is what is confirmed in ice-core and weather data. The point is that the scientists pass the common-sense meter, and all reasonable checks that an outsider can reasonably do.

                It’s clearly unacceptable to experiment with the planet’s climate, because we have only one planet, and we can’t screw it up. The uncertainties are relatively large, but there are certainties— like that the world will warm
                at least by an amount comparable to what it has already warmed in the next 50 years, and again in the next 50, if we do nothing. Those certainties are already unacceptable.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason to tax carbon is to reduce carbon usage. I don’t know why you think this will lead to a decrease in quality of life, it will probably make incentives to reduce sprawl, reduce the amount of time you spend driving,
                go nuclear, and explore geothermal and wind.

                Regarding when you know enough, you know enough with certain confidence to predict that the carbon will warm the atmosphere in the next 50 years at least by an amount comparable to how much it has warmed already, and that’s
                on the borderline of “completely unacceptable”. It will do so again in the next 50 years if we don’t reduce our carbon, and that’s probably a “catastrophe”. While I am not sure it’s a total catastrophe, hey, maybe the Sahara
                will become a rainforest, and the arctic ice will be gone, producing great shipping lanes, if you are realistic in your projections, you see that it’s not likely to have positive effects, and it’s not like gambling with the
                world’s climate is an experiment you want to do.

                I didn’t use any drama or embellishments, scientists don’t do that and didn’t do that when selling the arguments internally to the field. People used melodrama to make propaganda after they recognized the problem, and I
                don’t blame them, because the level of public discourse is so low, that reasoned arguments get drowned out.
            </p>
            <p>
                I understand your fear of regulations, and invasive bureaucracies choking an economy, but in this case, you have to answer the question “how can we reduce carbon emissions worldwide?” Markets don’t respond to this type of
                externality. People know that you should do it minimally non-invasively and without harming economic growth, and it is difficult to prevent new accumulations of power, and you want to do it without a massive bureaucracy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think the easiest way is just a carbon tax of the cap-and-trade variety, coupled with R&amp;D programs for nuclear power. Nuclear power is really the only carbon neutral fuel which is certainly capable of powering the
                planet essentially forever. But current nuclear plants are ridiculously inefficient (using only the fissile .007 of uranium), and there are much better reactors that can breed new fuel. But it’s up to the R&amp;D, the
                estimates from business, and the cap-and-trade prices to get these rolled out as fast as possible, with minimal invasive oversight.

                That’s true. That’s why you need observations and ice-core data, because for all you know there’s a negative feedback that cancels out the effect, like maybe “more CO2 leads to forest growth and clouds that reverse the
                heating”. But the detailed models show that there is no significant negative feedback (and lots of positive feedback, most significantly water-vapor), and the observations and ice-core data confirm the model prediction, with
                the positive feedback, up to a factor of 2 uncertainty (approximately, I don’t know the uncertainty, it gets smaller all the time, but it’s still large). So that’s enough to be sure. Science accumulates knowledge in this
                way, you need to predict, and test, and check, and predict again. But you also need to know when to stop and say “ok, it’s understood”.

                Yeah, yeah. I found sincere communists, I found sincere IRA supporters, I even found a (long ago) connection to a real Basque terrorist through a friend of the family. I know an Italian who vaguely sympathized with the Red
                Brigades, I even personally saw a Weatherman once, in the audience at a screening of a movie about that group (he stood up during the Q&amp;A period), even though there were only about 12 people in that organization. I am
                100% certain those organizations had sincere members, that they aren’t concocted threats.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand I don’t know a single Jihadi sympathizer, or anyone at all that is dreaming of any sort of caliphate anywhere at all, let alone in the West, or anyone who knows anyone who knows such a person, and that’s
                after asking around a bit with several Muslims about family and connections. Sorry, I call bullshit. The number of such people, if not zero, is small enough that they can’t possibly be a threat to anyone, except where a few
                people pretending to hold this ideology (even they are not sincere) are in charge of large amounts of money.

                The uncertainties in the data and the modeling regarding global warming doesn’t matter. The effect is something that you can understand for yourself in 10 minutes, and verify that it is significant with some additional
                personal calculation time. It doesn’t require computers, and it doesn’t require relying on experts. It’s a very simple theoretical prediction, and it is verified by observations. You should stop complaining about nonsense,
                and learn it.

                The causal mechanism is known in this case, extra CO2 increases the opacity of the atmosphere to infrared light by a known amount— it’s due to scattering by CO2. I was trained as a physicist, I have enough classes. Blocking
                infrared light is how you make a greenhouse, hence the 1970s name for the phenomenon “greenhouse effect”, which I still think is the best name. It has the causal mechanism right in the title.

                You don’t know how to do quantitative estimates in science. The CO2 warming calculation is very simple— you just need to know the rate of diffusion of infrared light in the atmosphere based on the CO2 concentration. It
                doesn’t require a computer, you can see that more CO2 leads to a warmer Earth without any assumptions or reliance on experts, and you can see it’s a significant effect, although you don’t know the feedbacks, so you can’t
                make a certain prediction without further data. But it’s a very simple effect to understand and predict.

                What the heck? Before the industrial revolution? Are you mad? We’re in the 21st century. Of course the region has more water! Saudi Arabia has desalination plants, wells are dug industrially. Your perception of the wealth in
                the region is grotesque. Syria and Lebanon are not that poor, people had relatively good living standards there. Iraq wasn’t that poor either, before sanctions, and all these countries were totally secular before 2000.

            <p>
                A tax on carbon will just produce incentives for innovation toward non-carbon energy. There is no barrier to being 100% nuclear, like France, and there are good plans for fast reactors. There are even “out there” proposals,
                like the “PACER” fusion power plant, which extracts the energy of H-bomb explosions, which are theoretically economically competitive, but were too scary to try due to proliferation fears.

                Sorry, but I can’t find any Jihadis. They aren’t anywhere when I ask around. I asked a bunch of Muslims from various countries “do you know Jihadis of this sort through any connection”, nope, nope, nope. There aren’t such
                people, except for isolated crazy people and shadowy organizations in the far corners of the Earth. I don’t believe in popular movements with no popular support, especially not when their platform is batshit 7th century
                nonsense. These threats are concocted, they are insane.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, I can do the CO2 warming calculations myself on a back of the envelope, and see that a 30% increase in CO2 should yeild observable effects. While I can’t get the magnitude of the effect precise, I know
                it’s a warming, and I know it’s significant. I can then use ice-core data to see exactly how much warming to expect, after taking into account ocean water, and so on, and it matches the warming since 1970. Note that I didn’t
                rely on any uncertain models for this, I can do all this myself with an envelope and rudimentary ice-core data. Then I see that the models are consistent with these sanity checks, and then I can trust the scientists who
                model. That’s how you verify science. You don’t use media reports, because these say idiotic things— like “scientists predict ice age!”, and they say it with a straight face. Scientists never predicted an ice-age in the
                1970s, despite media reports. These media reports were planted stories by quacks reacting to the scientists who predicted global warming.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scientists who predicted warming in 1970, long before any warming was observed, were not taken seriously by most climatologists until they were confirmed independently by two large data sets collected later, one was
                current climate data, the observation that every single year is warmer than the pre-1980 average, and warmer than the 1990 average, and again by the ice-core data tracking CO2 and global temperate over tens of thousands of
                years. That’s a slam dunk for a scientific hypothesis, it’s just true that our CO2 emissions are warming the planet, and you should just get used to it, because it is never going to go away.

            <p>Bernie Sanders probably won’t agree with what I have to say, but regarding your top three concerns:</p>
            <p>1. illegal immigration.</p>
            <p>
                Illegal immigration has stopped since the US economy tanked. The net immigration from mexico is zero or perhaps slightly negative today. This is an issue hyped up by the media, but it’s total nonsense, it has no basis in
                reality anymore. It was a problem in the 1980s and 1990s, now, it’s nothing. The US is simply no longer an attractive place to live.
            </p>
            <p>2. The war of fundamentalist Islam against us</p>
            <p>
                You have never met a Jihadi, you heard about them on TV. Nobody you know, Muslim or non-Muslim, is either a Jihadi or even in any way a Jihadi sympathizer, nobody you know has ever met a Jihadi sympathizer, nor do they know
                anyone who knows anyone who supports any of these groups.
            </p>
            <p>
                By contrast, if you wanted to find a communist sympathizer by asking around, it was pretty easy (it’s still easy). If you wanted to find someone who supported the IRA, neo-Nazis, it’s a bit harder, but not too hard. These
                neo-Nazis were never considered a real threat to civilization. With Jihadis, go and interview as many Muslims as you like, you won’t find any, directly or indirectly.
            </p>
            <p>
                To find a Jihadi, you literally have to stumble on an isolated insane person willing to set their underpants on fire, or else you have to go to the ends of the Earth. There is no such thing as a threatening political
                movement without any supporters, doubly so when their ostensible platform is totally insane 7th century batshit nonsense. No modern person in Syria or Iraq could possibly support such midieval nonsense, I know these places
                (I am Israeli by birth) and they were normal modern nations with normal secular populations before this recent trouble started. finding a Jihadi in Damascus would be like finding a King Arthur style knight in modern day
                Britain, it’s that anachronistic.
            </p>
            <p>But now you see what is effectively an army of midieval knights ravaging the countryside surrounding London. How did that happen? Tthere are still these organizations, like ISIS, you see on TV.</p>
            <p>
                In the case of ISIS, you have to look at the funding. There was a movement to destabilize the government of syria, and Western aid and arms flowed to a bunch of different groups. Among those groups, the most violent and
                repressive had a “Sharia law” mantle they put on which, in their warped minds, allowed them to gang rape women and terrorise civilians with torture and murder. The most vicious of such groups was ISIS, the more vicious you
                are the more success you have (the same is true of the Phalangists in the Lebanese Civil War, and they had no religious pretentions). Such terror tactics force people to submit unwillingly, through fear of torture and
                murder, not through any sympathy.
            </p>
            <p>
                These amoral folks then gained control of oil fields, and got an small army of young western teenage boys to come join them, using their money for propaganda, which was also Western aided, because there are conflicting
                interests. There are tons of moles and infiltrators in these organizations, paid by intelligence agencies, and you don’t know where the money is coming from, where your own tax dollars go. In project Gladio, the worst
                atrocities, it turned out, were committed by the CIA moles and infiltrators, not by the sincere members. Moles and infiltrators don’t have a conscience, and they will do anything to look more committed and radical than the
                next guy, just to not get found out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Right now, Turkey helps ISIS out because they are opposing a socialist Kurdish revolution in Rojava, the Kurds are a minority in Turkey who constantly seek independence. So Turkey shot down a Russian plane. Now some in the
                US seek to impose a no-fly zone against an ISIS with exactly zero airplanes.
            </p>
            <p>
                ISIS is collapsing as their army is deserting. They are losing every contested battle now, and their only remaining strength is in propaganda. There is 0% support for these people in the affected areas, people were polled in
                Lebanon (an affected area where people are still free to speak), and exactly 0% supported it. ISIS is not Muslim, it is not even pretending very well, it’s clerics are nonsense figures, hired for show. I’m not going to say
                that Palestinians like the US, but even among Muslims who don’t like the US, there is no religious basis for this dislike, it’s based on policy, and there is no motive for attacking the US, as any such attack only causes
                problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding 9/11, I invite you to consider that the US was staging military exercizes on the same day at the same time as the actual attack, simulating multiple simultaneous hijacking, as reported in 2002. There were uncannily
                predictive simulations of attacks during the London bombings too, and in nearly all other incidents of modern terrorism. The person who ran the 9/11 military drills is not a Muslim, he is an insincere Christian
                vice-president with a pacemaker. I suggest you look at the proper place to vent your anger.
            </p>
            <p>3. Political correctness run amok.</p>
            <p>
                I don’t see any change. In fact, I see a rise in frank speaking due to online exchanges which are full of vitriol, and outright hatred. I don’t like hiding things behind a facade of politeness either. If you mean that
                certain internet fora are overly censored, I agree. But it’s not anything a president can do anything about, it’s a cultural shift that is coming from the bottom up, not the top down.
            </p>
            <p>Sorry to tell you, but your top three concerns are made up media hooey. I am not trying to insult you, but the media is insulting your intelligence.</p>
            <p>
                Regarding Obama’s policies: yes, these have increased the gap between rich and poor. The problem with this gap is that it is contrary to the predictions of theoretical efficient free markets. In an efficient market,
                competition is supposed to control everyone’s wages, so that nobody gets to siphon off millions of dollars into their pocket. The reason is simply that if you are coming to GM as CEO and asking for a million dollars a year,
                theoretically, someone else should be able to say “Hey, I’ll do that for half a million!” and they’ll hire the other person.
            </p>
            <p>
                That doesn’t work at all in our economy, because there are tiers of management, and classes of people, and you just can’t submit a resume for CEO of GM, no matter how qualified you are. Further, these companies don’t take
                managers based on “lowest competent bid”, but based on name recognition, and the perception of the ability to do political maneuvers. These perceptions have nothing to do with skill.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason there is massive concentrations of wealth is not because of innovation and entrepreneurship, it’s because there are massive corporations which receive large amounts of profits, and then divvy up a certain fraction
                to their top management, instead of dividing it up in dividends to shareholders. The shareholders can’t complain about it, because the pay-packages are issued in hidden stock-dilutions, through equity issued to managers.
                These policies are part of the cause of the skyrocketing inequality. The other part is the competition between laborers and unemployed, and the lack of bargaining power employees have in such a situation. Employees cannot
                bargain their way to higher wages anymore, because, unlike the CEO, they will be fired and replaced.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason Obama’s policies lead to more inequality is because Obama was doing pure monetary stimulus, meaning he makes money through the Fed, and distributes it to banks. The idea is that this money should find itself into
                new businesses, and then to new employees, and then to new spending, without the government deciding what that spending should be. That policy simply didn’t work, the money enriched bankers, and didn’t do much to increase
                business investment, because the lending climate is terrible, and new businesses are no longer profitable investments (they would get killed by the giant businesses that have taken over the economy).
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe the only sensible policy is to break up the large businesses, but Bernie Sanders is more conservative, and just wants to implement a jobs program. Unlike financial stimulus, jobs programs go to the people who
                spend, without the banks as an intermediary.
            </p>
            <p>Regarding Sanders policies:</p>
            <p>
                1. Minimum wage and wage increases: the US has a problem today in that all small businesses are being gobbled up by gigantic businesses. Mom and pop stores are disappearing, and getting replaced by Wal-Mart and Cosco, and
                whatever other suburban monstrosity you see. These entities gain nothing from their size, except better contracts through their muscle, and the ability to pay extremely low wages to an army of people who are desperate. They
                can do this because these people have no choice, if they don’t take the job at these large places, they will be destitute. The policy of a high minimum wage is paradoxically designed to protect small business, and to
                increase spending, allowing such small businesses to flourish under fair competition. Such programs are required to avoid a collapse in wages to subsistence, which happened before in the US, in the depression, and is
                happening again.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. The point of college incentives is to decrease unemployment, as students are out of the labor market, and their degree allows them to find new jobs at a higher tier, allowing for greater job mobility. The tax on
                speculation is to place some friction on trades, which right now take the form of automated computer trading. I don’t know whether you follow the issue of “microtrading”, but this is the practice of looking to see when
                someone places a sell for say, 10,000 shares of Apple at 20.89, waiting for someone to issue a “buy” order at 20.89, and then BUYING those 10,000 shares at 20.89, and placing them up for sale at 20.93, forcing that person to
                buy the shares at 4c extra, just because you had the extra information that this person wanted to buy, and you are situated closer to the trading room computer by some microseconds. This type of practice is eliminated by a
                small transaction tax. Many such fraudulent practices are eliminated by a small amount of friction in trading. Subsidizing college with these tax receipts makes sense, as it props up wages.

                3. Nobody is silencing political speech, the point here is that donations of money are not the same as speech. If you want to make any ad, gather the money for it, and run it yourself. Unlimited contributions are not speech,
                they are bribery.

            <p>
                4. You need to understand Keynsian economics. The classical equilibrium for wages is when there is 0% unemployment, and workers can negotiate for a wage without competing with an army of unemployed. As you get closer to this
                situation, you get fair wages. When you have a mass of unemployed people, wages collapse. To reduce unemployment by a jobs program is how Eisenhower stabilized the US economy in the 1950s, and incidentally, how Hitler got
                Germany out of the depression in record time. It is a policy that ensures that a person can find a job, so that the private sector needs to pay a fair wage, and not count on the threat of homelessness and destitution to
                retain employees.

                5. There is a limit on minimum wage, which is when inflation starts. We are nowhere near that limit. The hard limit is the productivity in the US divided by the population, around $70 an hour. You can’t raise the minimum
                wage to $100 without at least 100% rise in prices. This is why monetary policy is a balance between unemployment and inflation, and also minimum wage policy. The higher the US minimum goes without inflation, the more the
                economy expands.

                6. Global warming is not imaginary. CO2 in the atmosphere heats up the planet, and it is easy to see that the warming we see is plausibly a consequence of the 30% rise in CO2 concentrations without anything other than an
                envelope and a few quick calculations. The prediction of warming was made in 1970, by several people, long before any warming was seen, and it was confirmed by observations since. It is doubly confirmed by ice-core data from
                Antarctica. There is no doubt about the effect of CO2, and there is no doubt that the CO2 emissions are responsible for warming the planet.

                7. Bernie Sanders is aware of the downward pressure on wages that illegal immigration causes. Protecting people who are already here by giving them a path to legal status, making sure they receive minimum wage and benefits,
                that goes a long way to ensuring the immigration doesn’t hold wages down. When it is not under-the-table, immigration is a positive influence on the economy, as you get all sorts of new influences and ideas, and subcultures,
                from a more diverse population. But regardless, there is no immigration problem today at all, and if it returns, it would only be because Sanders fixed the economy and people want to come here again.

                8. Black people are getting shot for no reason, dude. In 1995, I had just read about a young black kid on the subway who was shot holding a candy bar, the policeman said it looked like a gun, and then later that week, a
                policeman pulled me over for some traffic infraction, and I held my hands over my head, as I was worried he would shoot me (he just told me to put my hands down). That stuff happened every other week when I read the Times
                regularly, nobody said anything or noticed that it was always unarmed black kids getting shot. The level of police misconduct in this society is appalling, and intolerable, and any reform policy should be welcome. I would
                suggest to view the Netflix series “Making a Murderer”. There is no threat in reducing police misconduct, the rise in crime of the 70s and 80s was entirely due to drugs, a receding problem.

                9. Nobody should discriminate against gay people, or any other kind of people. You don’t like it, don’t engage in interstate commerce. You don’t like attempts at theocracy in Syria, why do you like it any better in the US?
                If someone doesn’t want to sell to gay people, let them run a private club, where they can discriminate all they wish.
            </p>

                A single-payer health plan is not exactly central planning, look at France. They have a private and public health-insurance market coexisting, with the public providing basic services, and the private insurance providing
                extras on top of that. The role of government is to make sure citizens get the basic level of care, if they want some crazy add-on, they can get private insurance in addition.
            </p>
            <p>
                The level of planning involved here is simply the minimum amount required to reduce unemployment so that wages rise again. This minimal level of planning is unfortunately necessary, and has been known to be necessary since
                the 1930s, to avoid the collapse of our economy to a third world economy. The most famous economist who advocated unemployment reduction is Keynes, and it follows from the general failure of industrialized markets to adjust
                unemployment to zero. If they did that automatically, there would be no need for government economic policy, but then again, everyone would be making a pretty high wage.

                If your definition of socialism is planning, then Bernie Sanders is simply not a socialist as far as you are concerned, and you can say he is misappropriating the label. If you haven’t examined his proposals you should, as

                Regarding trust-busting, the whole point of monopolies is that they are not a competitive market. You don’t have a choice any longer– you are forced to deal with the rail monopoly, the oil monopoly, the cable monopoly,
                whatever it is, to get the service. Free markets are predicated on competition to control prices and produce efficiency, and nobody pretends that they work without competition. It wasn’t just TR, it was Eisenhower,
                Kennedy,Johnson, Nixon, Carter. Anti-trust was bipartisan for 80 years, and should be bipartisan still, as it works to make competition.

                Power is not just about politics and violence, it is also about wealth and control. The problem with extreme wealth s that it comes at the cost of economic diversity, and it can destroy sectors of the economy. When large
                corporations takes over a competitive market by buyout, that’s the end of innovation, the end of rising living standards, and the end of your economic future.

                If you think “unemployment” is undefined, you have a psychological problem. “Subsistence wages” means you take the rent plus food plus gas to get to work and back, the absolute necessities, and compare that to the salary
                drawn by a WalMart employee (even in the presence of minimum wage). They are often within a factor of 2. The Pareto efficiency prediction is that the average wages everywhere are somewhere comparable to the mean productivity
                per employee, say $65 an hour. Which is the closer prediction? There is nothing vague here, or meaningless, or philosophical, this is the foundation of modern economics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mainstream economists are not sitting in a closed room plotting anything, this is a structural cul-de-sac. This is another thing that Marx wrote about, the way in which the power-structures of a society indirectly control
                academic thinking, by the wealthy owners exerting power, through endowments and grants, to purge any ideas they don’t like from academia. In this case, any economist who mentioned Marx in the early decades of the 20th
                century was simply purged as undesirable by pressure on departments to be friendly to big donors. SImilarly, again since 1976, left-leaning economists were simply purged one by one from academic departments, and quack
                Chicago school economists replaced them. Chicago school and Keynesian were running neck and neck, despite the Chicago school getting every objective prediction wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                That Keynes ripped off Marx is obvious to anyone who reads Keynes and Marx. Keynes was simply exploiting the hatred of Marx produced by the leftist revolutions of the early 20th century to steal his main predictions and
                dress them up in bourgeoise clothing. Keynes publically hated Marx, but privately hired Marxist economists as his closest associates. Keynes was the number 2 guy with no significant or correct original ideas, he was just
                selling Marx for the economist masses.

                Regarding NaSDAP (Nazi party), their economic platform was stolen from Keynes and Roosevelt, and was relatively reasonable. They didn’t come up with it though. They were able to go further, because Hitler was a dictator, and
                made sure everyone had a job by expanding the jobs programs until this happened. Hitler’s economic policy was massive road construction and military spending. Once unemployment was eliminated, wages were relatively
                egalitarian, as is always true. Hitler went further in terms of economic planning, and included ideas of “class cooperation”, which basically meant the government met with big business leaders to let them dictate general
                policy directions, making his government a “dictatorship of the bourgoisie” (at zero unemployment). This idea, of letting corporations dictate their own regulation, is a staple of Reagan and Bush economics, it has nothing to
                do with Bernie Sanders.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hitler’s jobs program— road construction and military spending— was copied by Eisenhower in the US. Roosevelt’s job programs were smaller and mostly ineffectual. It wasn’t the worst policy in the world, it worked at the
                time, but it still produces concentrations of power, in the US, Eisenhower called it “The Military Industrial complex”.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t like Hitler’s economic program so much, because what I said above is not Hitler’s, it’s not Keynes’s it’s not Marx’s and it’s not Lenin’s. It’s MINE. The new thing here is the disintegration of monopoly power, the
                structural splitting and decentralization of large businesses using tax policy, and this was never done, not in the US, not in Germany, not in Russia, nowhere. It is a libertarian anarchist idea, but it isn’t proposed by
                anarchists either. Ain’t no father to my style, boss.

                Sanders does not advocate government planning, he advocates policies to reverse the concentration of power in large private institutions. Reducing private concentrations of power is as important as reducing government power,

                The issue with liability is complicated— it is clear the makers of Sudafed shouldn’t be liable for brain damage if someone uses their product to manufacture amphetamines, but they might be open to liability if they knowingly
                engage in bulk sales to such people. This should have no effect on the price of legal Sudafed purchases, it would only make it harder for mass-producers of amphetamine. The same goes for legal gun purchases vs. mass purchase
                and sales to out-of-state gangsters.

            <p>
                It is simply wrong to say that Marxist economics makes false predictions. You don’t know what Marx predicted— it is exactly what happens in industrializing capitalistic economies. He didn’t pull his stuff out of a hat, he
                was observing English wages during the industrial revolution, and he supported his conclusions with overwhelming evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                The famous prediction Marx made is that the same capitalism which works for cottage industries is unstable to industrialization. Industrialization leads to consolidation of cottage business into gigantic industrial
                businesses by consolidating capital in banks and granting it to a few individuals to build an enterprise. These enterprises purchase wage labor as a commodity, and each one replaces many small businesses due to industrial
                efficiency. They therefore produce some unemployment, which theoretically should be absorbed by new industries as they appear, and this is what happens as long as there is sufficient demand for products. But the bugaboo is
                the wages— the unemployment drives down wages of all commodity employees far below what they would be in a Say’s-law zero-unemployment situation, the theoretical equilbrium. Absent regulation, any big industrial firm ends up
                paying subsistence wages to the vast majority of workers. Since these workers are underpaid relative to the economic equilibrium wage, there are two effects— first there are enormous returns on capital to the capitalists, as
                they don’t have to pay out their profits in wages, and second, the empoverished workers are not able to purchase all the products the economy can theoretically produce.
            </p>
            <p>
                This loss of demand eventually leads to a total collapse of business production, and ends either in total ruination or in revolution. The “ruination” scenario is what happened in chunks of South America until the recent
                socialist victories there, where the economy split into tiers, with a large underclass living on subsistence wages with enormous unemployment, side-by-side with a small number of well-connected owners and lackeys reaping
                enormous profits, who charge prices for their labor on an entirely different scale. The same process happened in the US after the frontier closed (the thesis is that the frontier could absorb any excess unemployed labor
                through land-grants, turning unemployed into subsistence frontiersmen). But even before 1890, post Civil War in the 1870s and 1890s, American industrailization produced recurrent collapses, the last and worst of which was
                the great depression.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is nothing that Marx said about the problem that is incorrect, he in effect predicted the depression, and his prediction is that absent intervention, such a depression is permanent. This experiment is not wise to try,
                but it has been tried in countries which industrialized under enforced free-market policies, like in South America. His analysis is not only insightful, it is probably the only significant insight in economics, which is why
                he is so famous.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keynes’ policies are based on the fact that Marx is the “he who must not be named” in economics. So Keynes takes Marx’s observation that worker produced demand is too low, and makes up a fable for why that is. He pretends
                that the too-low wages are a temporary glitch, and proposed “temporary” public spending to shore up demand. As anyone who implements Keynsian policies knows, these policies are anything but temporary, they are not
                anti-cyclical, they are avoiding a permanent and catastrophic collapse.
            </p>
            <p>
                The interventions in the market in the US and elsewhere are all really responding to this critique Marx made, except nobody is allowed to say it (except me, as I have no political constraints). All interventions since the
                1930s are purposefully aimed to prop-up wages and shore up demand, while simultaneously pretending that this is just temporary anti-cyclical intevention. Eisenhower stopped pretending, and instituted highway spending as a
                permanent Keynsian stimulus. Nixon didn’t pretend either, he used stimulus cynically to get reelected.
            </p>
            <p>
                The interventions cannot decrease and will never decrease, because there is no law that demands labor be paid the proper wage to purchace the maximum industrial output in a situation with commodity labor. In the modern US
                economy, the government arranges the level of demand by manipulating the unemployment and the money supply. If the government refuses to do this for some reason, you end up with a tremendous depression which leaves you in a
                situation comparable to 1980s South America, where America hypocritically disallowed any Keynsian policies despite using them at home.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s Marx in a nutshell. Regarding Marxist-Leninists, they fetishize Marx, and they usually go further, and propose a specific remedy for the problem: government ownership under one-party control. I don’t agree with this
                remedy at all, and neither did the majority of socialists in most of the 20th century, including Dilas, Orwell, Tito, Atlee, etc. it’s just that these bozos were the loudest voices.
            </p>
            <p>
                The “labor theory of value” is something that is often misunderstood in Marxist economics. It isn’t actually Marx’s idea, it is taken from an earlier bourgeoise economist named Ricardo. The point of it is that in a
                frictionless free market equilibrium, profits go to zero, labor prices go to a standard wage, and the price of product is reduced to the expenditures that go into it, which ultimately boils down to the standard wage times
                the number of average hours that go into producing the product. While Marxists often cite this as normative, it is also the same as Capitalist equilibrium, and it only differs from other theories in philosophy. Your
                philosophy shouldn’t matter, it is just political, I don’t care what you call it. The trade-value in equilibrium is what the price of a product would be in a frictionless situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The deviations from the labor-cost situation are those where there are monopolies and concentrations of power. These are, according to you, “how markets are supposed to work”, but this is not what the theorems people prove
                are about. The Pareto theorems about efficiency relate to equilibrium, not to situations where certain people are sitting on property generating high prices which don’t reflect average labor cost times hours worked. Any
                deviation is an inefficiency, and what you are doing by celebrating deviations from the law is maximizing inefficiency in an economy. These inefficiencies are every multi-millionaire, every billionaire, and everyone with a
                patent or a copyright, but we accept a certain amount of inefficiency to reward innovation. You can’t let yourself accept inefficiency to reward anti-innovation, as in consolidation and rent-seeking.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you say “socialism effectively wants to turn the entire economy into government granted monopolies”, you are talking about a very specific form of socialism— the kind advocated by mid-twentieth century political
                figures, say Atlee, so that I can pick a well-liked leader of a free country. He nationalized the coal industry. This type of centralized socialism generally kills innovation dead, it is effective only for certain naturally
                decentralized activity where innovation is relatively easy to recognize and copy using objective tests. An example is state sponsored R&amp;D, where individual labs are relatively easy to evaluate. In those cases where
                innovation happens largely at the individual level, where there are simple objective criteria for success which are comparatively easy to recognize, distant pay-offs which make private financing effectively impossible, and
                generally agreed public benefits. I don’t think the importance of the NSF is up for debate. I would argue that public education, laying down communication and transportation infrastructure, and space-exploration are exactly
                the same kind of thing, where a Soviet approach is good, because these are the things the Soviets were best at! They were best at chess, athletics, things where it is easy to objectively identify the winners, but maybe not.
                You know, try it and see.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nobody is advocating this type of socialism for the economy as a whole today, definitely not Bernie Sanders, and definitely not me. But this doesn’t mean that there aren’t other approaches (which Bernie Sanders has never
                supported either). One key point of socialism is fair wages— that the wages paid reflect the rate at 0% unemployment, where labor is scarce. This can be produced non-bureaucratically by a jobs program, as long as there is a
                program that ensures that no unemployed person will be turned down. The wage of a state subsidized job can be tied to their productivity at laying down fiber-optic cable, putting down new roads, etc, whatever objective thing
                they are doing. The wage for this public job is an effective minimum wage, because if you are offering less than that, you had better be doing something really interesting to justify it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second point of socialist thinking is that workers’ labor must not be alienated labor. That means that a worker’s complaint needs to have a certain probability of affecting the workplace conditions, and in case it
                doesn’t, that worker should not have a hard time finding a workplace which is more responsive. For this purpose, a graduated corporate income tax is a good remedy, as it produces small firms.
            </p>
            <p>
                A third requirement of socialism is that the profits are not accrued distantly, but are distributed widely, so that any corporate are not accumulated by a small class of top management. This can be easily produced by a
                policy of “no insider equity”. Corporate salaries, unlike equity packages, are actually pretty reasonable.

                A fourth requirement of socialism is the idea of a plan for the future. I believe that this can be taken care of by non-governmental organizations, with no power of coercion, which can freely adopt members, much as religious
                institutions do today. The goal of these is to produce a social plan, and if you don’t like your religion, you just change to another competitor. These organizations can go further, and press certain businesses to adopt
                fairer wages and become worker-owned, simply by applying economic pressure. No government needs to get involved.

                All of these things are either purely voluntary, or done using regulations that are already largely in place. They require no onerous bureaucratic oversight, they are structural policies. They are also not far from what is
                already done. For example, in the telecom deregulation act of 1996, the infrastructure was socialized for the public, and the carriers would provide services riding on top of this. Of course, telecom recentralized in the
                2000s, using the shift to wireless and online, but it must be decentralized again.

                Regarding health care, Europe has a tremendous advantage because businesses have nothing to worry about regarding health care— the public part is state, and any private add-ons are the individual. The business never has to
                worry about it. In the US, businesses have to arrange for health insurance, and big businesses get breaks due to their contracting power and much larger bundle. I would assume the US would follow a French model more than the
                more old fasioned and centralized British model, but I don’t care which, as right now, I personally can’t see a doctor.

                Sanders policies can’t be argued to be a significant increase in state power— all the regulations are already there, they’re old, and the enforcement precedents for his proposals are there too. The regulations of monopolies
                was established by Teddy Roosevelt, with the Sherman act, and breaking up rail, oil, and communication monopolies was harder than breaking up banks, as there was physical infrastructure issues regarding those. Banks are easy
                in comparison. Public works spending was standardized by Eisenhower, and never stopped really, just the levels go up and down according to political priorities. So I don’t know what you are griping about. Any public
                contracting on roads goes through a bidding process, and while it is not optimal, it isn’t the type of waste you see at the Pentagon, and the money helps struggling districts, and constitutes the most effective Federal
                financial distribution program from wealthy states to poor ones. This redistribution of money is how the US prevents Misissippi from becoming Greece.

                In the 1980s, anti-trust enforcement was given up, and the justice department redefined competition so that basically two to five gigantic firms that shut everyone else out are perfectly fine. This was assumed to be healthy,
                just because it was healthier than the USSR, where it was one state-run gigantic firm. Five competing gigantic firms, as in clothing, is better than the USSR, but it’s still terrible in terms of innovation and labor
                alienation. I don’t agree with this type of centralization policy, I think economies innovate only when barriers to entry are low. I can give you a list of examples til the cows come home of how innovation worked, and then
                disappeared when businesses got large.

                I doubt you considered strongly graduated corporate income tax seriously, as it is not at all like other anti-monopoly measures. It is nearly impossible to circumvent, except by false splits. The goal of contract reform is
                to ensure that ostensibly independent firms are actually independent, and not just declared independent for tax purposes. The goal is to get firms to a managable size, much like Unix puts together small programs to achieve
                arbitrarily complex goals. When you have “everything and the kitchen sink” firms, they can’t do any one thing well, they do everything half-assedly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of non-bureaucratic reforms like graduated income-tax and transparent contracting is precisely to avoid putting any men or women in charge of any other men or women. Transparent taxation policies like this are not
                easy to circumvent, as they require a special exemption for your large firm to be legislated into law by a public deliberation process. The goal of campaign finance reform is to avoid giving anyone the power to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that the end goal of minimizing centralized power is best achieved by such policies, that they are not pointless, because they really do try to make sure that power is broadly distributed. I am painting a rather
                more bleak picture of the US today, due to recent experience with retail in suburban Connecticut, where it is a nightmare of chain-stores and lifeless malls, with zombified people living empty lives. Seeing it, it is a
                wonder that the suicide rate is so low.

                Hitler turned the economy around in about 8 months, long before the takeover of Austria. The reason is that he reduced unemployment to zero. In the USSR, there was no great depression (or for that matter, any recessions at
                all), because there was always zero unemployment since the early 1930s. I am not advocating either Hitler or Stalin as models, these are terrible leaders, the point of this is that your critique is incorrect. The reversal of
                depression in Germany predated any annexations, and was caused entirely by putting the unemployed to work in road construction and rearming the country. In the USSR, the labor was used to industrialize and electrify the
                country.

            <p>
                In the US, the same policies did not put everyone to work, and worked to a lesser extent. When the war came, everyone was employed, and the economy recovered completely. This led to four decades of consensus that full
                employment is the primary goal of government economic regulation, a consensus that was reversed in the 1980s, leading to the problems we see today.

                Morgenthal was a bourgeoise dipshit, a rich nitwit like all the other high-class hangers-on around Roosevelt. He, like nearly all economists of his generation, had no idea what Marx was saying, only Keynes did. Morgenthal
                wouldn’t understand an aggregate demand graph if it bit him on the leg.
            </p>
            <p>
                The slowing down of growth in the US is a product of neoliberal policies that reversed Keynsianism and anti-trust regulation in the 1980s. The erosion of free labor is caused by the free-fall in demand cause by low-wages.
                Low wages come from competition with the unemployed, and also through mergers and consolidation that alienate labor, reduce actual efficiency, and remove all innovation and competition. These things were disguised in the 80s
                and 90s due to the computer revolution, which increased productivity so much, it seemed there was growth. But wages were static in this period, despite the growth in productivity.

            <p>
                On these points,Bernie Sanders is only minimally suggesting to restore the sensible Keynsian policies favored by Eisenhower and Nixon. He isn’t proposing more radical measures. Whatever Morgenthal said, he is dead, and he is
                dead wrong. I have no respect for that airhead.

            <p>
                As far as I can see, he is not advocating increasing state power in any significant way, nor is he advocating reducing state power either. He is advocating using the existing moderate level of state power to reduce
                unemployment (by a jobs program and subsidized college) and reduce the power of big-business (by enforcing anti-trust law and breaking up banks), and reducing the cost of business through a public health program (this
                benefits business in Europe— health-insurance bundles for employees is one of the so-called “efficiencies of scale” in box stores). These policies are a no-brainer, they are a combination of the best standard Democratic and
                Republican policies of the past 80 years. He also wants to make incentives for worker owned business, and to direct R&amp;D efforts towards the problems of global warming, and he advocates reducing state power of
                surveillance. In general, unlike any of the other candidates except for Rand Paul, he advocates a strict, essentially libertarian, approach to civil liberties.

                The “handful of big-business owners” is not at all fictional, you need only look at the distribution of income and property in the US to see this. The US economy does not have a broadly distributed ownership class anymore,
                and the stock of publically traded corporations does not usually reflect expectations of dividend, but expectation of growth for a monopolistic business. The profits are divvied out to a handful of multi-millionaires and
                billionaires at the top, through equity programs. The higher management is rewarded with a non-negligible fraction of corporate profits. Even if you own equity in a public corporation, the company will reward stock and
                options to it’s management, effectively diluting your stock and stealing from you to enrich it’s board of directors. These awards are not market based, they are the corporate management lining their own pockets with the
                profits, instead of distributing it to shareholders and taking a competitive salary, as would happen in an idealized frictionless market.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding “anarchy”, the position of traditional European anarchy is the minimization of BOTH state and private power. This is tricky, as the way to reduce state power is traditionally through a network of businesses which
                provide services, while the way to reduce business power is through government regulations. This creates the perception that there are only two alternatives— increasing concentrations of private power, or increasing
                concentrations of state power.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t believe in this dichotomy, because I believe that simple regulatory frameworks, much simpler than the current nightmare of regulations, are capable to reversing the concentration of power in private organizations.
                The only thing you really need, I THINK, is a strong financial incentive for firms to split up into smaller firms, something which can be done using a strongly graduated corporate income tax based on the number of employees.
                The other thing is a strictly regulated contract law that makes sure that entities which are independent are open with their suppliers and publish their supply contracts and prices, and suppliers are required to price the
                same to all buyers (within reason— so a standard box of screws doesn’t cost the same a single screw, but the standard box of screws is the same price for Walmart and my local store). These policies can encourage the
                unfreezing of a frozen economy, by dividing up businesses into managable chunks that can be competed with without raising billions of dollars. The contract law should also be standardized enough that corporations can’t
                legislate to consumers through fine-print in their service contracts.
            </p>
            <p>
                As far as I know, nobody suggest this as policy except me. But I like Sanders because he proposing older ideas that have already been tested in many places in the world, including the pre-1980s US, and are certainly
                beneficial.

                Your reasoning is based on false 18th century microeconomic model, and this was explained by Marx in the 19th century, and repeated by Keynes in the 20th century, and is basically folklore today. The rate of unemployment is
                not determined simply by the way in which businesses consolidate and therefore require more labor for overhead and day-to-day operations. It ALSO depends on the total wages gathered by all the workers in the business, the
                so-called “aggregate demand” that they generate, in Keynsian terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consolidation lowers wages and reduces aggregate demand, and the loss of aggregate demand is GREATER than the difference in the number of employees in the chain-store vs. the small business network it replaces. Obviously,
                because the labor costs for the chain are lower than the total payments to those working in the small businesses, that’s their entire “efficiency”! The gained “efficiency” is precisely that the pay of the workers is reduced
                (assuming this is the only source of their margin, it’s not— they also get special deals from suppliers).
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though a certain number of extra people are needed to do the same amount of work in a chain store, the reduction in demand due to their low wages in a chain-store dominated economy leads other businesses (that have
                nothing to do with the chain store) to close, which increases unemployment elsewhere. Everyone ends up working for the chain stores eventually, regardless of skill, collectively doing less than what they were doing before
                the chain store actually took over. This is not theoretical, there are college graduates and entrepreneurs who are forced to work for chain stores today.
            </p>
            <p>
                I should point out, on the 0% chance that you go and check the Marx reference, that Marx wasn’t exactly talking about chain stores and small retail businesses in Capital I, but about large automated factories replacing small
                individual cottage industries, leading to a complete collapse in aggregate demand (an observation he demonstrates with extensive British labor statistics from the mid 19th century— I think Capital is the first systematic
                collection of such statistics). But it’s the same principle. In the case of factories, there actually ARE economies of scale, they are real, and due to automation. In the case of retail consolidation, the gains have nothing
                to do with any automation. They are simply due to rotten wages, and due to political power.
            </p>
            <p>
                The criterion of fairness for prices is described by free efficient market theory— the fair price paid for a product is the competitive price when there are an infinite number of competing producers, and the fair price that
                goes to labor is the price that the labor can charge in an economic equilibrium with effectively no unemployment. That’s the model in economic textbooks. In this equilbrium, any “theory of value” is equivalent to any other,
                they only differ in philosophy, and I don’t care about that.
            </p>
            <p>
                In such a perfect efficient free market, corporations have no profits beyond what is required to pay costs and salaries and return on capital costs. All workers make roughly the same salary, roughly up to risk and hours,
                quality of work, etc, which account for a difference of a factor of 4-6 in salary. The owners of the factory make about the same as the workers, with a bit of a premium for risk. That’s what economic equilibrium looks like
                theoretically, and it is also what actual markets look like in a village economy with small businesses with independent producers. If you look at a typical small business, the owner is not making more than 5 times the
                employees.
            </p>
            <p>
                But in real markets, when you have enormous corporations, the model is completely distorted from this idealized situation, the kind where the statements you made about “more demand for workers means higher wages” makes
                sense. In the enormous corporate world, unemployment is intrinsic, it is part of the system, as the industrial economy hires and fires workers in chunks of 10,000, so people migrate to the cities to be a part of the labor
                army, producing a certain amount of unemployment. This is unavoidable.
            </p>
            <p>
                The threat of unemployment, when it is present, drives the wages of all labor to subsistence. The only exceptions are cases where someone has some leverage to charge higher prices for their labor, due to some scarcity in the
                service that they offer. These scarcities are never permanent, eventually other people learn to do what you are doing, and your wage recedes to market average. The only people who extract large salaries are not those who
                have skills, but those who are positioned to siphon off corporate profits into their pockets, without any bidding war by people willing to offer the same service, a bidding war that would drive their compensation to market
                average. Such people have an effective monopoly on a position of power, and are selected from a separate class than ordinary workers. These workers skills are not computer programming, engineering, or any other rarified
                skill, but the ability to shake hands, be nice, and look people in the eye and convince them that they are trustworthy. These skills are the only route to wealth, and they are not skills, they are the opposite of skills.
                They are social bullcrap.
            </p>
            <p>
                These fairness criteria are accepted by most people. The price you expect to pay is the competitive price, not “what it’s worth to you”. Even if you are dying, and would pay $1,000 for a glass of water, the water’s price is
                the competitive price, not the maximum price you would pay. The only person who can charge a price which is at the maximum of what an entity will pay is someone with a monopoly, a famous name, a celebrity, someone with a
                government granted monopoly, a patent or a copyright. These are not free-market prices, free-market prices are essentially egalitarian and reflect the labor embedded in a product.

                It’s not about agree or disagree, it’s obvious why the big firms take over. The companies that employ slave labor are cheaper, because they pay their workers too little. The equalization of wages in a zero-unemployment
                free-market with fair-contract law would quickly put WalMart out of business, as it is a terrible place to work and a terrible place to buy, except for the deals you can get.

                The goal of socialism is to protect you from a handful of big-business owners who are just as overweight, ignorant, and unstable in their sex-lives. These owners are taking over the economy, and it was a policy for over 100
                years to reduce their power by anti-trust action. This has reversed in the last 40 years, and now big-business is the only business in most of America.

                What I am describing is NOT an efficiency of scale, it is exploitation. Efficiencies of scale are actual efficiencies— doing the same thing with less labor. There is no reduction of labor in the operation of a chain store,
                if anything, it’s more hours of human labor per unit product, it’s just that the labor is not paid anything at all remotely fair. The difference between a chain store and 1000 small businesses is that the labor in the small
                businesses is free and self-directed, the products are more diverse, there is more potential for innovation, because the business is self-managed. The owner of a one-person business is making $100,000 a year to justify the
                business, and can quickly and effectively respond to the market with her own brain. She stocks her own shelves, she decides what products are good, which are not, and it’s not up to a small bureau with 8 cigar smoking
                businesspeople in a room.
            </p>
            <p>
                The labor in the chain store is effectively enslaved and making $25,000 a year. The only efficiency gained is the false efficiency of reducing the average income of those working to give you the product. Reduction of wages
                is not an actual efficiency, but it sure looks like one when you do a corporate quarterly report.

                Even when the firm passes the savings on to the consumer, the consumer is only getting a deal because there are other people whose labor is too cheap, and their lives must be subsidized by government programs. The only
                difference between the big store and the small is that the employees at the big store are being paid far less than their labor would be worth under proper competitive conditions. If there were zero percent unemployment,
                nobody would work at WalMart unless the wages were astronomical, because it’s a truly terrible job.

            <p>
                While there are a handful of exceptions to the rule about big business, they are always unstable to buyout and consolidation. The pattern of industry in the US is a remarkable period of free market innovation, like with the
                competition between free-press newspapers in the 1960s, that ends when one well-financed entity takes them all over through buyouts (as happened with the free press when Rolling Stone bought them out and killed the market).
                The resolution to such consolidation is active policy to ensure business stays competitive, and this is what the Sherman act was supposed to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Sherman act is not enough, in my opinion. In order to make a healthy economy, one needs to encourage a zoning policy that fights sprawl, and a tax policy that fights against size, so that big firms are punished for their
                size. This is simply to counteract the terrible power that comes with size, the power to hire labor at ridiculous rates, the power to drive competitors out of business with predatory pricing, and the reduction of say in what
                the actual wares are.

                If Wal-Mart were a flea-market, with independent vendors hawking different things in different departments, the stocking and restocking would be more efficient, the wages would be fair, and the orders would not be
                centralized and homogenized. This type of thing would raise prices somewhat, but only in the sense that minimum-wage labor and large-size predatory contracts wouldn’t work. There is no additional advantage of these large
                businesses.

                I don’t agree that small firms producing crazy products will always exist. They are unstable in a situation such as today, when large firms are taking over. The consolidation of power in a capitalist economy produces an
                alienated workforce that is chronically underpaid, because the labor is not freely competitive, but is competing with an army of unemployed, and there is no potential for small business, because it is quickly consolidated or
                bought out.

                There are no choices anymore, only horrific gigantic retailers that give me a headache. I will never buy from these, so I’m limited now to the NYC area, but even here, it is impossible to avoid regarding clothing, and in the
                last decade, the shops in NYC are closing at a dramatic pace, slowly getting replaced by these monstrosities, and I will have to leave the country. I assure you that it is not like this in Hong Kong, in Israel, in Italy,
                where small businesses still exist for retail, and small businesses open and succeed regularly. Regarding US software, internet service, cable, rail, buses, soft-drinks, candy, even taxi service and NY cart vendors, these
                are all just outright monopolies.
            </p>
            <p>
                While many of the other large businesses are not monopolies in the traditional sense, they have a handful of other gigantic competitors, they are large businesses which replaced thousands of local small businesses, and
                because of their size, they are able to exert contractual power in restraint of free trade, as they can use their size to underpay employees and undercut competitors with predatory pricing. That puts them under the scope of
                the Sherman Anti-Trust act, and so the use of the word “monopoly” is appropriate in spirit, as they really should not exist. There is nothing more efficient or beneficial about having a Walmart replace 1800 small businesses.
                They are cheaper because they employ underpaid labor, all but slave labor, and get special deals from suppliers due to threats allowed only by their size. The “savings” they pass on are costing your entire economy, because
                these businesses cannot innovate as well as 1800 independently owned shops. Actually, they cannot innovate at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Large businesses have a lot of overhead and bureaucracy, and are less efficient than a network of small businesses. They only gain an advantage in a situation where they can hire wage-labor at low cost, and manipulate the
                governments and zoning boards to give them a deal. They also rely on the ridiculously subsidized roads and automobiles that have made most Americans, those outside NYC, spend half their lives driving places, rather than
                living.

                Worker owned business, in the old days, did sort of take over the market, in the age when every business was small, many family owned, and operated. Independent contractors, small firms making a few things, these firms are
                often worker-owned, and even when they are not, workers have a great deal of say in how the business is run, and the owners listen and respond to their concerns. When the economy was organized this way, the efficiency was
                higher, and all the innovation comes from these firms anyway. The issue is that when there is a low minimum wage, and a bought-out government, small business can’t compete with big business paying slave wages and getting
                special contracts due to the size and muscle. This has replaced the healthy American small business economy with gigantic box stores and ridiculously inefficient multinationals, that are hardly distinguishable from Soviet
                firms.
            </p>
            <p>The worker owned businesses in the US are not market tested, and regardless of the market, they should be the norm, because workers prefer working there, and the products are better.</p>

                Regarding Sanders comments about choice, he was criticizing the illusion of choice regarding underarm deoderant. If you look at the active ingredients and composition, the firms are all putting the exact same product in
                different shaped boxes, with tiered pricing to different socioeconomic groups. It’s the same story regarding laundry detergent, regarding breakfast cereals, and the illusion of choice is produced by a single non-innovative
                gigantic firm, sometimes two firms, placing the exact same product in 18 different boxes. This is not real consumer choice, which is defined by many small manufacturers taking risks, and producing actually different things,
                as you will find, for instance, with natural deoderants, or alternative detergents, where the firms producing them are tiny.

                Hitler implemented road construction Keynsianism (copying FDR, later copied by Eisenhower) and got out of the depression in less than a year. Britain had Keynsian policies throughout the postwar boom, so did all of Western
                Europe. Scandinavia and Yugoslavia had more radical policies, which encouraged worker-owned business, and boomed even more. Morgenthal’s opinion is ridiculous, the only failure of the New Deal was that it didn’t do enough
                spending, because Roosevelt was not a dictator, and Hitler was.

                would be happy if both the government and the citizens agree to limit themselves to crossbows domestically, but that’s not going to happen. I am not a spokesperson for Bernie Sanders, I’m just a supporter. I’m much further

                Even if your income is high, a pro-growth policy increases it in absolute terms, it just increases the income of low-wage earners more, so you might not be so wealthy in relation to your neighbor. Redistribution policies are
                required for growth, I am sorry to tell you. Without it, you get a third-world economy, with tiers of society cut off from each other, obscene inequality, and massive inefficiency. Eventually, you get a revolution. In the
                current climate, most people are working for gigantic box stores, and making a terrible wage, and need public assistance even with a full time job. That’s the government subsidizing effective slave labor. When those workers
                get paid fairly, the whole economy grows through their purchases, and continues to grow until the productive capacity is stretched, at which point you start to get inflation. I don’t see inflation as a problem today, low
                wages are.

                I agree that illegal immigrants drive wages down, but that’s because they have no legal protection. Immigration to this country is not exploding. My parents came here 35 years ago on an H1b, and I can assure you that
                American education is not competitive. Americans, even the best educated ones, are mathematically and scientifically ignorant compared to people in other countries. It’s not your fault, you just have no good schools until

                said “Of course!” Not even granting legitimacy to the other side. He is not Obama, and he isn’t willing to compromise on the constitution, or on civil liberties, but he is also a good politician and will say what is
                necessary to get elected. Support him, he is your best hope for a reversal of the police state. I mean it. That’s why I support him.

                Presumably the illegal semi-automatic was procured by stealing the legal one from somebody. Countries without semi-automatics don’t often see criminals with semi-automatics— the criminals get cheap illegal handguns with

                wrong with saying you need to reload after 6 shots (or however many)? That’s the kind of public policy debate Sanders is proposing, not taking away all the guns.

                Keynsian driven economic policy describes every Western nation in the last 80 years. It is the reason that the Fed can print money without spiraling inflation. The Republicans predict inflation every time a government has

                armed communist militias, Tito led an armed population. The hard left is not always out to take guns away.

                His statement that you quote, when made specific in discussions, does not explicitly talk about handguns, but is, upon clarifications, revealed to be about guns used to “kill large numbers of people”, that is military style
                automatic and certain semi-automatic weapons with large magazine clips. He thinks those should not be on the street, and that’s the extent of the regulation he has proposed.
            </p>
            <p>
                He has not yet included handguns, because handguns can be used for something other than killing people, in particular offering security from attack, through the threat of killing people. But he leaves himself wiggle room on
                this, because he is completely to the right of his entire party, as am I, on this issue. Perhaps you don’t like it, but it’s far more supportive of gun rights than any other Democrat. Hillary Clinton would like all guns
                confiscated, all gun manufacturers out of business, and is proud to say so.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea that you would protect yourself from “thugs” with guns is pretty silly. Unless you are a small business owner, or landowner, i.e. if you are a typical city dweller who doesn’t own a liquor store or jewelry shop, you
                most likely won’t protect yourself with a rifle or handgun. You will just get yourself shot in a gunfight, or accidentally shot by your kid finding it in your small apartment. But the ownership of guns has been historically
                useful in preventing Fascism, which is why I personally accept it, against my initial judgement, going along with George Orwell and Karl Marx, who both, from experience, said that liberty and gun-ownership go hand in hand.

                No, I don’t know anything about firearms, I hate guns. But, despite this, I strongly support the RIGHT to own firearms, and I am POSITIVE that Sanders does too, as I have been following every statement he has made this
                campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
                My position is a TINY MINORITY position in the Democratic party, so if someone like me is running for president, he would have to be careful. Bernie Sanders supports gun ownership too, explicitly, because he SAID SO, and
                SAYS SO whenever anyone asks him for specific policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                “The American people have a right to own firearms” is his quote from the last debate, and it is consistent with his voting history, and specific policy proposals. Other Democrats generally don’t believe in an individual
                right to own firearms, constitution be damned. Everyone else in the Democratic party is out to curtail gun ownership rights drastically. I don’t agree with them on this issue, but frankly, it’s not my top priority, because
                it’s ultimately protected by an amendment, so it realistically can’t be touched.
            </p>
            <p>
                The positions he has taken on guns are mildly inconsistent, as he is facing a tough primary fight on the issue. He agrees with his own state’s zero gun control policy, and has voted to support it. But he also is sympathetic
                to people in cities who want to see an end to gun violence, so he shows empathy, without boxing himself in with specific proposals that would restrict guns unduly. A president has to understand murder victims in Chicago as
                well as gun enthusiasts in Vermont. Bernie Sanders is the only one who can get the two sides to talk to each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                He hasn’t taken any explicit position regarding regulating handguns. His statements are vague, and only troubling to you because you simply are not part of the urban Democratic party. You could summarize his position as “No
                gun control at all in Vermont. Best if there are no guns in Chicago.” It doesn’t make sense, exactly, so you need to look at his record, and his record and explicit commitments are firmly on the pro-second-amendment side of
                the issue.
            </p>
            <p>The remainder of the Democratic party has as a top priority ending the gun culture in America. Bernie Sanders doesn’t. He has never voted to over-regulate guns.</p>

                The drills regarding airline blips and simulating airplane crashes were reported in the New York Times, along with other newspapers (I read about them in 2002, and didn’t think much at the time). Most Americans know about
                one of these from the small amount of attention they got, the “coincidence” of multiple seemingly unrelated military exercizes simulating hijacking on the exact morning 9/11 is more or less a well documented fact in the
                American press, and common knowledge among well read folks, regardless of politics. It is not reported much outside the US. You can find ample verification by following the links in the link I gave recursively, and using a
                search engine.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mainstream story makes these drills, simulating multiple simultaneous hijacking on the same morning of 9/11, a crazy coincidence. The existence of the drills is not disputed by anyone. but you do need to think a little
                about how a false flag must work in order to understand the significance. That’s what I provided with the framing story of the false flag, a sketch of how the one person who headed all of the drills pulled it off without any
                co-conspirators. Important authors who noticed long before I did are Webster Tarpley and whoever wrote “Flight of the Bumble Planes” in 2002. It is important to know how the 9/11 false flag was staged, because otherwise you
                don’t understand WHY all these drills are coinciding, without the framing story, it just looks like the most uncanny coincidence in history.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you understand that 9/11 was done from within the American government, and possibly only by only one responsible person: the vice-president, it stops being a world issue and becomes an issue of American corruption. The
                problem here is covert activity, secrecy, and unnecessary drills turning into terror. False flags are pulled of by the US and it’s allies in other countries all the time, for instance, the Syrian gas attack blamed on Assad.
                it just doesn’t happen on this scale, and modern technology allows a person powerful enough to head enough military drills to do it essentially alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                That means you need remedies, like open government, and especially open drills. You need to be able to trace CIA payments so that no covert money ends up attacking the US. It is difficult, because the CIA is largely
                independent now, and can’t be audited well.

                I have written about it at length elsewhere, I will link to a summary someone else made on 4chan at the end. To make a long story short, the US military was simulating crashing airplanes into buildings, radar blips
                simulating multiple hijackings on air-traffic computers, and had live-fly drills involving god-knows-what military aircraft buzzing around throughout the attacks of 9/11, on the same morning. There were other more peripheral
                drills as well. While simulating a terrorist attack while the same attack is going on might seem to be the coincidence of the century, it is not, once you understand how to pull off a 9/11 false flag. In order to do it
                without an army of traitors, to do it essentially alone, one person has to be in charge of ALL the drills, and this person needs a precise exact set of drills to pull it off. Those drills you would need are precisely the
                ones we know about, with an additional drill one can infer which is not reported, because all of its participants were killed on the flight identified as flight 93. Here is a link to more details:

                I am sorry, but I have been to other countries, and the US health care system, even if you are wealthy, is the worst in the world by orders of magnitude. You get bad treatment, you get pushed drugs and tests you don’t need,
                just for profit, and you pay three times what you should, and that’s if you get a break. Every other country you get prompt effective treatment that costs at most half as much, and the results are much better both socially
                and customer by customer. I got treated in Hong Kong once, and I was startled at how much better China’s health care was than ours.

                Bernie is explaining the difference in perception of guns in rural vs. urban areas. Guns serve no legitimate purpose in any city, they are always used for criminal activity, robbery or murder, and they are essentially
                useless even for self-defense, except in certain circumstances. Bernie Sanders is explaining the divide in the country, and explaining why it is tough to get a consensus.

                He isn’t saying that there should be different Federal laws for one set of people rather than another, he is saying it is a tough issue. And he is right. I live in NYC, and I wouldn’t touch a gun with a ten foot pole. But I
                understand the position of someone living in rural South Carolina who likes to target practice, who likes to shoot, and feels confident that his gun is not going to get him killed.

                This is true, but a factor of 6 is a large factor— it’s the difference between a 50K salary and a 300K salary, and this is the actual typical incentive for a small-business owner to run a competitive business. Larger
                salaries only come in gigantic firms that operate on completely different principles. In large business, the risk is always insured, the innovation comes from buy-outs or rip-offs of small business, and the real big rewards
                are handed out politically to the board of directors, and the board of directors does not consist of entrepreneurs, but a bunch of snotty Ivy-League brats who maneuvered up the heirarchy by sycophantism and glad-handing.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you think entrepreneurship risks are too great, you can suggest a government program for subsidized entrepreneurship insurance, or negative taxes on smaller businesses, that would be just fine by me, but Bernie Sanders
                had not suggested this. You might also be able to make this a private business, although in the market today, it would not be worth it, as no entrepreneur can really make it without the help of gigantic (already structurally
                insured) venture capital firms, as large corporations will generally destroy your venture before you have a chance to grow.

                He isn’t lying, but, yes, he is doing pretty much exactly that. He’s straining to the center of the Democratic party on this issue, and the center of the Democratic party pretty much believes “guns are used to shoot people.
                They are a bad product, like cigarettes, and should be illegal.” That’s their position.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sanders doesn’t believe that, and he’s appealing to this Democratic party center with more honesty than Clinton ever could muster in a million years. This is the ONE issue that Clinton is further left than he, and can appeal
                better to urban voters, so Clinton made it a big deal, and Sanders is doing his best to bend and twist, within the bounds of honesty, so he doesn’t lose the primary. He’s doing about as well as he can.

                You really don’t appreciate how scared people in cities are of firearms. Nobody has a gun in a city, except for criminals. It’s a big divide. People in NYC are scared to death of guns, and want them banned outright, and
                don’t understand your stance. They wouldn’t want to own a gun even if it were free, it’s entirely useless here for any sort of protection except in stupidly getting yourself killed in a firefight, or accidentally getting
                yourself shot.

            <p>Keynsian stimulus is not correcting lack of private sector investment, it’s correcting something else, which you probably don’t agree even exists (but it does).</p>
            <p>
                You are right that Keynes said stimulus should be temporary, but you must understand that no Keynsian takes this seriously, because they knew something about the economic context. The Keynsian policies of the 1940s were
                doubled down on in the 1950s, and again in the 1960s, and yet again in the 1970s. There was nothing temporary about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason is that Keynes is really responding to Marx’s prediction that demand is too low in industrialized economies, because the wages of workers are not in equilibrium. In a classical “small town economy”, with a
                butcher, a baker, candlestick maker, you get equilibrium roughly when the wages of the average professional equalizes, so that an hour’s worth of candlesticks are of approximately equal value as an hour’s worth of baking.
                This equilibrium is the outcome of Smith’s invisible hand, it produces a relatively fair distribution of income, with some differences of a factor of 4-6 based on talent and ingenuity and hard work.
            </p>
            <p>
                In an industrial economy, you get a completely different sort of labor— the hired employee. The employee does not negotiate from a position of strength, he is competing with the unemployed, and he can be let go at any time.
                So his wages go to subsistence, and absent intervention, they stay there. The owner of the factory gets all the profits, and no ingenuity or hard labor is required, other than the ability to become part of the owner class.
                It’s a perversion of the Adam Smith ideal, but often you hear people pretend that our industrialized economy is still rewarding hard work by a factor of 4-6 pay inequality, just like the village economy. That’s not what is
                going on. We have a factor of 400-40,000 wealth inequality that has nothing to do with talent or hard work, but based on class identification.
            </p>
            <p>
                This process of producing inequality though the transition to industrial labor is what Marx works hard to show in Capital. The point is “too low demand”, which means, workers aren’t being paid enough to buy everything you
                could be making.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keynes kept this idea, but Marx is totally taboo in normal economics circles, so he had to make up nonsense to justify it. He made up a just-so story about workers refusing pay-cuts, and so on, so as to get the result he
                needed— too low demand. Once he had this (which was really just a rip-off of Marx), he advocated government spending to compensate for the lost demand. This is the classical situation with Keynsian policies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The thing is, the demand really never goes up, unless workers are making a bunch more money, and they never do unless unemployment drops to low single digits, because wages are always depressed when there are people
                unemployed. So Keynsian fixes become permanent, their goal is to keep unemployment at 5% or so, and you get obscene military spending, and road spending, whatever, whose only purpose is to raise wages for people by
                decreasing unemployment. It’s a very indirect way to do it, because you don’t want to interfere with the free market too much. It wouldn’t be necessary in theory if workers got a wage that reflected their labor, if they
                weren’t treated as a disposable commodity.
            </p>
            <p>
                But without these interferences, you aren’t going to have demand in the maket, and the industrial economy crashes. This is what happened in 1929, it’s what is happening to a lesser extent today, and it is always true that
                the US is not operating at anywhere near it’s productive capacity, because of money distribution problems. Sanders proposes Keynsian fixes, but also hints at more structural fixes that will try to raise wages for workers
                intrinsically, so that it is more like the “village economy” than the “industrial economy”, at least as far as what wages look like.
            </p>
            <p>I am sorry for writing so much, but it’s an involved topic.</p>
            <p>
                Regarding the promises and the potential— you need to give Bernie Sanders a chance. He has advocated tough policies, including sending certain bankers who engaged in fraudulent marketing of derivatives to jail. He has the
                backbone to prosecure malfeasance, and there is a reason people go out of their way to make propaganda against him. Please listen to him, give him a fair shake, because he is not a run-of-the-mill lying politician, he is a
                principled man.

                I don’t believe it needs a definition, because it’s exactly the question of whether police take your information seriously. Sanders isn’t calling for laws to prevent weapons stockpiles. He is just saying “you are allowed to
                report suspicious weapons activity”, and you are. I don’t agree with him on reporting that kind of nonsense, but I don’t think he’s so wrong on it either.

                He is not promising pie-in-the-sky things. Public education and public health are sensible, because the private sector always screws them up. He is also about enforcing anti-trust regulation against the giant banks, and
                protecting your business from predatory practices by monopolies. This is essential for the health of the US economy, it used to be standard Republican policy since Teddy Roosevelt, until Reagan redefined the word
                “competition” so that it doesn’t mean anything.

                You need to learn to differentiate propaganda from history. The crimes of Stalin and Mao are real, but they have nothing to do with Keynsian economics, or Clement Atlee, and neither with Tito, Dilas and George Orwell, or the
                Anarchist revolutionaries of the 20th century. History is not a simple thing, and it doesn’t often come with clear-cut good guys and bad guys. That’s why it is important to understand all philosophies, including the ones you

                Sanders is not making new laws to take away your rights. He is advocating repealing laws like the Patriot act and corporate pork which took away your rights in the last decade, and have not been repealed, due to a bought out

            <p>That’s Mao’s book. Marx’s books (Capital/Manifesto) are actually very good, and his ideas are the basis for Keynes’s reevalation of the role of money in an economy, which is the foundation of modern economics.</p>
            <p>
                The point of Marx is that workers get paid too little, when big corporations call the shots. they always underpay their employees, because the employees compete with a pool of unemployed (Marx called this the “reserve army
                of labor”). This competition ultimately destroys the economy, and leads to a revolution, if not corrected by something.
            </p>
            <p>
                The split in the 20th century was regarding what to do with this observation. Keynes was the mildest— he said you should print money and use it to hire workers in government projects, so that workers would get paid more by
                reducing unemployment. That’s what people did in the US in the 50s, 60s, 70s. Scandinavians and Yugoslavians decided that workers should own the businesses and decide how the profits are distributed. Russians and Chinese
                decide that the government should own the businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea of a centrally controlled economy is ridiculous, as it leads to the government being essentially a gigantic super-corporation. Nobody proposes that today. Sanders is calling for Keynsian policies, which should not
                be controversial. He is also proposing incetives for some worker-owned businesses, to see how it works out. None of this is coercive, or communist. It is a good idea.

                He supports SOME gun regulation, but not any regulation of principle, nothing that would take way your normal guns. He’s not completely pro-gun, but he’s the best Democrat on this issue for you, and you are attacking him.
                You should be voting for him instead. It’s like attacking Rand Paul on civil liberties, when all the other memebers of his party are far worse.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sanders is not a communist. He is a social Democrat, he is has always OPENLY been a social Democrat, and that means he is out to make sure gigantic corporations don’t take away your right to form and build a business. Right
                now, monopolistic firms are taking away small businesses faster than they are created, more businesses close down in the US today than are created.

                Sanders is the Democrat who supports the right of people to own guns, to hunt, and to shoot at targets. He is saying that it is ok to report suspicious activity, if they want (it is their right), he is not calling for the
                police to take away the weapons.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should look at Sanders honestly— who else supports ALL your constitutional rights? Including the right to be free of the threat of indefinite detention, and extra-judicial execution? Warrantless wiretapping? He not only
                supports your gun-rights, he supports your free speech rights, your right to habeus corpus, and Republicans have fought to get rid of these, sometimes with the help of Clinton.

                He didn’t say the guns should be taken away, he said “you should report suspicious activity, like weapons stockpiles, if you are suspicious”. This is a question regarding what citizens should do, and it’s a bad question, and
                a dumb question, because it’s not about public policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bernie Sanders, unlike other Democrats, generally accepts the right of Americans to own guns. He doesn’t want to take ANY rights away, but to restore the rights the Bush administration took way, and Obama has failed to

                There aren’t any significant acts of terrorism committed by Muslims. There are acts of war in unstable countries, there are crazy individual murders with no coherent political motive, and there are false flags. ISIS might be
                the exception to this, as they seem to be self-financing now, but as their leadership is about as Muslim as Ghenghis Khan, I doubt it. In order to end Modern terrorism, it is important to put Richard Cheney on public trial.

                usually totally blind to race issues, and they unintentionally pick up on disrespectful racist cues from the culture, which drives young black people up the wall, sometimes resulting in violence. It’s not justified, but you

                authority very strongly, and when the authority structure of society is against you, there are some people who become violent. It’s stupid, but it happens.

                decades, linked to real world activity with my name on it. If you google the name “Maimon” you find it is a common Jewish name in Israel, it’s the family of the Maimonides, found in Russia and North Africa. My father is a
                Tunisian Maimon who emigrated to Israel in the 1960s. My father’s North-African ancestry probably helps make me immune to your real motivation, which is anti-Arab racism, but regardless of his ethnic background he’s an

                The reason I mention the IRA, the PLO, the Basques, the Weathermen, the Baider-Meinhof gang, and the Red Brigades, is because these are the last authentic terrorist organizations active in the West. After the infiltration
                and destruction of terrorism by projects like Gladio in the 1980s, modern communications tools made terrorism both counterproductive and impossible, and it disappeared entirely in the mid-90s, to be replaced by it’s fake
                state-sponsored counterpart— Al-Qaeda and ISIS. There are no authentic terrorist organizations active today.

                There is no Muslim doctrine of lying to non-Muslims just as there is no Jewish doctrine of lying to non-Jews. By the way, that nonexistent doctrine, regarding Jews, is an old anti-Semitic trope used to explain why Jews
                didn’t reveal their sinister agenda. Your racism is old, it is that same old deadly Hitlerian version of conspiratorial anti-Semitism that needs to die, regardless of whether the target is Muslims or Jews.
            </p>
            <p>
                But of course, you will now invoke the doctrine of Jews lying together with the doctrine of Muslims lying, to explain why I am purposefully lying, and then you will conclude that the Jewish and Muslim conspiracies have
                joined forces.

                original ideas, old ideas. The best theorists have about a 50/50 mix of correct and incorrect ideas, and the percentage of incorrect ideas RISES with the quality of the scientist, because originality means you are sometimes
                wrong. Dirac had the varying G theory, ‘tHooft thought Hawking messed up a factor of 2, Witten had cosmological constant cones, Galileo thought circular pendulums are equichronus, every great scientist has wrong ideas. This
                is why science does not criticise people, it looks at the ideas themselves. But you’re not a scientist, just an idiot.

                It’s called the “steady state universe”, and Gold worked on it in the 1950s. He also worked on other things too, he had a long career. Steady-state is a very good theory, it’s just happens to be wrong, as discovered by data
                collected later, in the 1960s. That’s not a strike against the theorists, who were honest and worked well to develop it. A mathematical part of steady-state theory (positive cosmological constant deSitter vacua) survives
                inside modern inflation theory, and in the far-far future (100 billion years from today), steady state will be a correct theory in certain sense, the universe will settle into a deSitter vacuum (but without the constant
                particle creation the steady-state folks theorized). It’s no strike against a scientist to be wrong, your job is to be original and to be parsimonious. Nature tells you when you are wrong, and in the case of abiotic oil,
                nature agrees with Gold.

                to reproduce quantum mechanics from local hidden variables. His work on this was valuable even when it was wrong (although these are his three worst papers, they are justly forgotten today). You are too ignorant to criticise
                the science, so you criticise the scientist. It’s funny.

                Actually, I discovered it for myself. I recanted for a week or so under pressure from colleauges who laughed at me, but then I read Gold’s book and confirmed I’m not crazy. So you would be more correct to say “you read zero
                books” than “you read one book”, as I don’t read to get scientific ideas. Kudryavtsev for sure read zero books, there weren’t any. The idea is correct regardless of the number of experts on the other side, and it is
                sufficiently obvious by now that the more you argue against it the dumber you reveal yourself to be.

                Regarding methane, however, the battle is already won. Abiogenic methane is believed in the west to constitute the “vast majority” of methane. Of course, it’s not the “vast majority”, it’s “all”, but you can let them come to
                their senses slowly, as they are only slightly less dimwitted than you.

                Methane is abiotic even in the West, the Western oil scientists capitulated on this about a decade ago, that’s the first real crack in the crumbling biogenic theory. What is still disputed in the West is that coal is also
                abiotic. Coal is the end product of methane percolating through porous sedimentary rock, turning the rock to carbon gradually by carbon substitution, preserving preexisting rock features like sediment layers and fossils.
                Peat is not a precursor of coal, it is the same carbonation of vegetable matter exposed to methane outgassings. It is easy to demonstrate both claims by seeing the close association of methane and coal and methane and peat,
                both form exactly along the migration paths of methane, as orginally observed by Kudryavtsev and confirmed by later research. Everything the industry says about the science in the West is total horse manure. This is all
                covered in Gold’s book “The Deep Hot Biosphere”, which despite the seeming originality, is largely a summary of 60 years of Soviet research.

                still accepted in post-Soviet Russia, Ukraine, Vietnam, and anywhere else where they have 30,000 ft deep oil wells that show that the biogenic idea is a crock. You are exactly right that it is like global warming.

                An alpha particle is going too fast initially for electron capture. That’s why people didn’t know what the heck it was at first, and called it an “alpha particle”. It’s just 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Once the alpha stops,
                it’s positively charged, it attracts two stray electrons and they attach and emit ultraviolet light, and then it’s Helium. That’s how all the He on Earth is formed (any He in the atmosphere escapes eventually, the He is too
                light to stay bound to Earth). The concentration of He in oil shows it was passing through a place with lots of radioactive decay. This is a smoking gun of mantle origin, because that’s where all the heavy radioelements are.

                It’s not BS, but you need to know some chemistry and physics to see that. The easiest way to demonstrate it is to look at the He content of oil— He is produced from radioactive decay. But much more is known, the whole
                pathway of oil and coal formation was pretty much entirely sorted out in the USSR, with some minor contributions in the 1990s from Gold at Cornell, and a replication of the crucial Soviet experiment about pressurized
                methane. At mantle pressures and temperatures, the methane is unstable to forming short-chain hydrocarbons, and these form petroleum by percolating through rock. The Western theory is BS, and it really has no leg to stand
                on, but this is it’s last stand, as the internet makes it clear there is no evidence for the biogenic theory, it was just an entirely wrong guess.

                Ha ha! Yes, quantum gravity. That’s another thing the press gets wrong. String theory solved quantum gravity in cold spaces in 1997 (but still, not for an expanding universe, no inflation, so not our universe quite, but
                close). I am personally a proponent of string theory, like many other physicists, and string theory was a joint Russian-American development, but to be fair, mostly Western (it was first developed in California and Italy in
                the 1960s and 1970s, the Russians got ahead briefly starting in the early 1980s with Polyakov and Knizhnik and that gang, but they were never as sophisticated after 1984, the Americans were definitely ahead here after 1985.
                The great string theory work is mostly American, and it is what for me makes the case for America being number 1. It’s hard to judge this stuff, dude, I am trying to be fair.

                You can assert all you like, but the unequalled contributions of Russia to physics are mostly freely downloadable online today, and you just make yourself look foolish. There is no dispute that the best physics papers of the
                1970s and 1980s are Russian, this is true just by citation counting (SVZ and BPZ are some of the heaviest cited papers of the era, along with the American Weinberg paper for the standard model). The Nobel committee is not my
                problem, they have been out of touch for decades. That’s why the Dirac medal was established, and if you look at the Dirac medalists, the Russians are fairly recognized (and Europeans too, especially Italians, who are also
                regularly slighted by the Swedes).

                You don’t understand why the USSR had the largest oil production in the world. It’s not like it had a large amount of oil in 1945. This worried Stalin, as he knew the West would control the Middle-East oil. So in 1950, he
                set up an all-union conference on the origin and exploration of petroleum. This was like a Soviet “Manhattan project”, it was enormous, and by 1955, Kudryavtsev had proposed the abiogenic hypothesis as a plausible theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                By 1975, the USSR had demonstrated the basic principles of abiogenic petroleum, and rejected the voodoo Westerners use to dig for oil, opting instead to dig extremely deep boreholes in a grid, all over Siberia. The deepest
                holes in the world are a byproduct of this exploration. They found a ton of oil by digging where Westerners won’t simply because the Western science failed to discover that petroleum is abiogenic (we’re catching up now, due
                to the internet).
            </p>
            <p>
                This is in every way a failure of Western science, and it can be attributed to Capitalism. The oil scientists are working for large oil companies, and they are not able to reevaluate the fundamentals of their field, no
                matter how much the data disagrees with their theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                The modern kleptocracy has no relation to the USSR oil exploration, which was just fine in Soviet times, actually, much healthier than it is now. The state-run oil and gas industry was perfectly competitive with the West,
                actually, because they understood oil much better, they took the West to lunch.

                In physics, which is the only field I am qualified to judge, the USSR was arguably the best, and if not the best, it was a close second to the US, in any case it is a very tight race. If you ignore the 1960s, where you have
                Landau’s school leading the research on He4 and Superconductivity (although the Americans had Feynman’s theory and BCS theory, just to be fair), and just go to the 1970s and 1980s, the Russians were first with Gribov’s
                Reggeon perturbation theory, Polyakov’s conformal bootstrap, inflation theory, they had the remarkable Gribov domains, the Shifman Vainshtein Zakharov QCD sum rules, the BPZ revolution in critical phenomena, the Polyakov
                string, 2d gravity, incredible stuff. It is highly technical (so highly technical that it is not appreciated by non-specialists), and it wasn’t flashy enough to get the attention of the Nobel committee, which was somewhat
                biased against the USSR, not by conspiracy, but just due to Sweden being a Western nation. Soviet science was rather insular due to travel restrictions and no-need for publicity by their scientists. But everyone who reads
                the technical literature of the 1960s-1980s knows that the USSR was the powerhouse, and you couldn’t get by without JETP in your library. It’s not just physics of course, they were strong in most technical and engineering
                fields, with the exception of biological engineering, where they were somewhat behind.

                But the US folks were much better in computational stuff, like Renormalization group theory, and Western Europeans and Californians developed string theory, so it’s not like the US was slacking off. Like the space race, it
                was a tight, tight race, that benefited all of humanity. Just the Russians, in my opinion, produced more sophisticated baroque work. Compare the BPZ paper (a masterpiece) with, say, great American papers like those of Edward
                Witten. They are both great, but the Russians are more “out there” and more technically dense, the ideas come from outer space and it’s HARD stuff, I mean, hard for even specialists. It’s a total judgement call, and I’m not
                going to argue this for too long, because it’s silly, but there is no doubt that Russia had the strongest or at least second strongest physics in the world in the 1980s (it’s gone downhill since the collapse).

                Although the Russians were somewhat ahead of the US in analytical tools like dispersion relations and conformal theory, in parts of condensed matter physics, in analytical tools for high energy physics, the Americans were

                revolution, e.g. Orwell’s “Homage to Catalonia”. The same pattern continued in the 60s, 70s, 80s, the Soviets took over Cuban socialists with promise of oil and aid, like they promised arms and aid to infiltrate the Spanish
                unions. The Soviet influence in the US was essentially nil, the American influence in the USSR was much greater. Google is your friend, man.

                I don’t think it was a good system, I am not an advocate. But it had good scientists and engineers (equal to the US), an excellent education system (the best I think), reasonable heavy-industry (although out of date by the

                The main problem with the USSR was the lack of innovation. The terrible leadership was a symptom of a much larger disease in the system, which made the whole economy and politics basically frozen in time. You couldn’t do
                ANYTHING, it was a nightmare to start anything new, you would need to rub elbows with lots of people, and the only thing that ever got done (outside of science and engineering— where they were world leaders) was copying the
                West badly, always about eight to ten years behind. Yugoslavia was ahead in this regard, as Yugoslavian industry was managed locally, you can read Dilas for criticism of the USSR system from a Yugoslavian viewpoint somewhat
                more libertarian than Tito’s.

                The lesson of the USSR for me is that you can’t have a “vanguard” deciding things for other people, the only proper way to do socialism is not by top-down imposition, but bottom-up, by voluntary association, without anyone
                coercing others. Since I don’t believe in coercion, I am not going to coerce you to agree on this. I do agree with you that the problems in the USSR were deep rooted in the system itself. If you want to see what the “good
                socialism” looks like, look at Linux development, which is similar to open science.

                I am just doing my duty in explaining the situation in the Middle-East to you, it’s not particularly fun for me, but it’s educational for you. Syria was a Soviet-allied state, it is far more secular than Gaza (Gaza is about
                as religious as most of the US). Syria and Lebanon are probably slightly more secular than Israel nowadays.

                British crusader. Syria and Lebanon are more secular than Connecticut. Can’t fool me bub, I know the places.

                The former USSR was indeed a very complex society, but unfortunately, it’s leadership was not, and the leadership decided foreign policy. The leadership was a dozen simpleton functionaries chosen by a process of
                groupthink-selection who did nothing the least bit innovative or creative. If the USSR’s leadership was anywhere near to being as diverse and representative of it’s people, it might not have been such a terrible place to
                live.

                I am not taking about my microcosm, I am talking about sampling— the support for radical Islam (as it is defined by the media) among actual Muslims you can meet and talk to polls at as close to 0% as is possible to measure,
                unlike the support for the IRA, or the support for the PLO, or Hamas, or Hizballah (I have found people who support those). That level of support means it is not remotely plausible that ISIS and similar groups are in any way
                an organic Muslim movement, they are a creation of funded agencies whose goal is to destabilize foreign governments. It is an INSINCERE movement, a movement of non-Muslims putting on a headscarf and yelling “Allah u akhbar!
                Yitbach al Yehud!” just to make a bogeyman for you to hate.

                You are being trolled by your own governments. The “Islamic propaganda” online is just made by intelligence agencies to catch radicals. They catch the same people that take the flat-Earth society seriously. They sometimes
                get a person to light their underpants on fire, or to shoot people, or to join a rapist’s organization like ISIS, but they have no real Muslim support, nothing. No serious person takes this stuff seriously, you won’t meet
                any. And I don’t believe in mass movements with no masses behind them.

                The only conclusion is that radical Islam is financed by something other than Muslims, and gets its support from something other than Muslim masses. That something is your tax dollars, and Turkey’s, and oil sales. The
                movements are fake, they are not organic, they are produced by Western intelligence agencies, much like the Contras.

                By contrast, the Kurdish movement in Rojava is a real popular movement, it is a secular socialist movement of Muslims, it comprises the forces that defeat ISIS regularly, and who are opposed by NATO through Turkey. And I
                assure you that it is easy to find people who know Kurdish KPP supporters just by talking to any three random Turks.

                This is not fiction. The USSR hated the new left, as it competed with the “old left” of trade unions. But even the “old left” American trade unions purged their Soviet-leaning members from positions of leadership in the
                1920s, during the first red scare, and even before— Samuel Gompers hated the communists because he believed they were economically illiterate (regarding that generation of communists, he was usually right). The USSR didn’t
                like any movement it couldn’t buy out the leadership of. The USSR had a very narrow agenda, of producing movements with heirarchical power structures whose leadership it could then merge into the communist party of the USSR
                with promises of oil and engineering.

                Of course I tried to find them! When I heard about Maoists and Trotskyites, I tried to find some, and found some. I even found a person who knows a Basque terrorist incidentally through a family friend. A popular movement is
                characterized by some nonzero degree of popular support, and if you want to find an IRA supporter, just ask 3 Irish people, and you’ll find one of them knows somebody who knows somebody.

            <p>
                On the other hand, when I asked Pakistani muslims, Iranian Muslims, Palestinian Muslims, looking to know if anyone in their extended family or network has ever MET an Islamist anywhere within their personal lives, the answer
                is “No. Never.” This kind of sample extends to an (unrepresentative) sample of thousands of people, and all of them sincerely report “No, not this type of radical”.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that these Muslim people (unlike me) still BELIEVE some fraction of Muslims are radical like this, mind you, just not anyone they know, or anyone they know know, and so on, just maybe some “other” somewhere in
                Bangla-Desh somewhere, or in the hills of Afghanistan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I am talking to people in the West, but their networks extend, and when I asked about Maoists and Basque terrorists, I found them. This “radical Islamic terrorism” is in the uprecedented position of having no popular
                support.

                The bloody history of Islam is neither here nor there, most religions have a bloody history, including the Jews, if you look back to the seige of Jerusalem in the Roman wars. We are living in the modern world, and Muslims
                outside of Saudi Arabia had their religious shift to secularism in the beginning of the 20th century, and you don’t usually go backwards. Secularism only reversed in Iran and Afghanistan, and in both cases due to superpower
                meddling and financing of movements without real popular support. Iranians aren’t fanatical Muslims as a rule, perhaps Afghanis are, I never met an Afghani, but for sure no one I can speak to holds this ideology, or knows
                anyone who does.

                I am sick of hearing about a movement whose supporters I cannot find, and whose ideology it is impossible to believe anyone seriously holds. If you want me to believe that some millions of people today are living in the 8th
                century, SHOW THEM TO ME, and not in anonymous propaganda tweets from paid shills, but a real person who you know personally.

                The difference between a bigot and a racist is the degree of political power. When Muslims are attacked, Jews are usually next in line. The Europeans shifted from anti-Jewish to anti-Muslim bigotry with little problem, it’s
                not much harder to go the other way. If you do not stand with your Muslim brothers and sisters, who will stand with you? It is much easier to support the fabrications of the last 15 years than to open your eyes, but if you
                wish to be an ethical person, you must not be silent when even a minority of your country turns to fascist bigotry. Remember that in 1932 elections, the NASDAP only won 40% of the vote, and yet was able to finnagle its way
                into power, because the opposition was divided, socialist against communist.

                How many Islamists have you actually met, Yehuda haLevi? Have you spoken to one? I try to find them, to see if they exist, and I always come up empty. All I meet in real life are ordinary people of Muslim religion, some
                religious, none with any political aspirations to a caliphate in New York City. If you can’t find any members of a movement, what kind of movement is it?

                The members of ISIS are all bought and paid off, the leaders are insane 20-somethings with guns who care more about raping women and murdering people than any prophets. Their finance comes from wealthy individuals and oil
                sales, they literally have 0% support in any affected regions where people may speak freely. The phenomenon of Muslim terrorism is a fabricated non-movement, it doesn’t exist in any numbers significant enough to cause any
                threat to anyone. One would be better off being concerned about Mexican cocaine dealers.

                The New Left was not sponsored or endorsed by the Soviet Union, which did not like the Democratic ideals and individualism associated with the movement. The USSR had zero influence in American politics past the 1950s, either
                overtly or covertly, it had very little influence since the first red scare of the 1920s. Some on the new left were communist leaning, but they were more associated with the 1968 Prague Spring, the “communism with a human
                face”, than with the 1917 revolution. Their activities were suppressed by the communist party of the USSR, as it suppressed all true leftist democratic traditions in 1936 Spain, in 1960s Cuba, in 1950s Hungary, and tried to
                do in Yugoslavia. The deplorable inertia and conservatism of the USSR’s huge lumbering bureaucracy is hard to understand for those with no experience with it, considering how fluid and radical leftists were and are

                The pot culture is uniformly libertarian, usually left-leaning but not always, but by construction always self-defeating, because the drug destroys the users’ memory and motivation very gradually. It slowly eats away at only
                the highest cognitive functions, until there is nothing there anymore, and you have a shell of a person. So these emptied out former leftists forget their mathematics and education, forget the principles of economics, all
                they have are vague emotional cues, which are then filled by television and rock and roll in such a way that they join the mainstream right (and simultaneously stop smoking pot, stabilizing at this endpoint). This is what
                happened to an entire generation of radicals. I mean, even John Lennon supported Reagan at the end, after his brain was eaten away. I don’t want people to go to jail, or get harassed, just to please voluntarily avoid these

                You don’t understand what “gold standard” means. The gold standard means that the amount of money is tied to the amount of gold, so that if you want to double the amount of money in circulation, you need to mine enough gold
                to double it’s abundance. The Fed can always raise the value of the dollar by simply decreasing the number of dollars available, although this would be a really stupid thing to do, so it never does this. Modern money is
                issued by central banks, for social ends, it has no intrinsic ties to any commodity. That’s a good thing that people fought and died to get for over a hundred years, starting with Shay’s rebellion in the 1790s.

            <p>
                Gold is traded in dollars too. Honestly, there is some effect of the international demand for dollars, but this is not particularly important for anything resembling productive economic trade. The role of currency is just as
                an intermediate for getting people to move stuff around and work on it, so that it becomes useful.

                Please, think about what you are saying— if the dollar were tied to oil, the price of oil wouldn’t change, instead of halving, as it did over the past fiew years, the price of everything else would double. There is no
                commodity which serves as an anchor for the value of the dollar, it is entirely determined by Fed policy. This is essential, because it allows the Fed to produce inflation when it is needed, and control inflation when it
                gets out of hand.

            </p>
            <p>
                The rejection of Keynsian economics is especially serious in the case of Rand Paul, who advocates a gold standard. Paper money was won during the Civil war, but lost again, and it was only won permanently in the 1930s. In
                every period, the gold standard led to periodic deflationary busts, no loans and bad terms for borrowers, and economic contraction. It’s a debate we had already.

                handful of times, just to get a sense of what it does (it makes you forget mathematics). My only activities online regarding marijuana is to warn against it, because it is a tool to decimate the left. In the US, nearly all

                This view is idiotic considering the situation in the US market today. You don’t have any choice where to buy clothing, internet, building-products, food, or computer products. You MUST buy the terrible products of enormous
                monopolies, because you have no choice. Either wall st. picked exactly one firm to make large, as for example it did with Google and Facebook, or else the larger firms piggy-backed on their size to make predatory contracts
                which got them special price-deals which allowed them to get rid of all small local business, as in the case of Walmart. Further, as an employee, you MUST work for one these enormous firms, because the only alternative is
                unemployment and destitution. While some people are willing to endure that kind of suffering to fight monopolistic firms, you can’t expect everyone to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
                This idiotic facade of choice only becomes meaningful in an honestly competitive environment, with hundreds of small-business competitors, protected from monopolistic price-fixing and predatory contracts, and for employees,
                it is only meaningful under conditions of full employment at reasonable wage, Then you can really choose between products, and between workplaces, and the competition is real. This is the situation with small business, it is
                not the situation with facebook or Walmart, or Time-Warner Cable, or McDonalds, or Apple, or any other national chain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Full employment has traditionally been the number one priority of American socialists, while ensuring competition has been a traditional Republican concern, in the 1950s and 1960s, until Reagan stopped doing it. In the
                1980s, anti-trust law was gutted, as the notion of “competition” was exanded to the point where it became meaningless. Breaking up large businesses that stifle other businesses used to be the one thing conservatives and
                liberals agreed on. Not anymore. Since political commitees can’t be trusted with anti-trust, they get corrupted, perhaps it is better to replace anti-trust law with a graduated corporate income tax, to produce the
                appropriate tax incentives to split firms without any direct meddling by government bureaucrats.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, once you have the choice you talk about for real, every employee will certainly want to work at a worker-owned business, and every consumer would want to buy from such businesses, as their products are simply
                superior, as more brain-power goes into every decision. But you don’t need to legislate the outcome, just ensure the fair-playing field, avoid the concentration of capital in monopolistic business, make sure each businesses
                is of size 10-1000 people (supplying each-other by contracts), and the rest should happen naturally through competition.

                I agree about the collectivization, it was a catastrophic policy which took the land away from the workers and gave it to the state bureaucracy. I am not advocating this Soviet nonsense in any way. I am simply describing how
                it worked, so as to refute the argument that it failed because of “lack of incentive”. This is simply incorrect. The Soviet Union had PLENTY of incentive, and in many areas, like Science and Engineering, heavy industry, it
                had much stronger incentives than the West (and in those areas, it was extremely competitive). Soviet industry failed not because of lack of incentives, but because of a total lack of innovation, which has little to do with
                incentives on work, and everything to do with hierarchical power-structures that produce ossified bureaucracies with no innovation potential.

                In the West, you would just start in a new firm. But in the East, to start a new firm, you would need to beg the same people who thought your idea was stupid to begin with. The Soviet Union relied on vacuum tubes into the
                1980s! They only partially switched to transistors, and they lagged behind in silicon technology to such an extent that the home computers were nearly 8 years out of date. There was NO FREEDOM to innovate.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is why freedom is essential— so that people can try out new things. The rewards for innovation do not have to be monopolistic ownership of a billion dollar firm, they can be a million dollars and the satisfaction of
                creating something new, which is the typical situation in a healthy competitive economy. The problem is that people think that the rewards that come to managers of monopolistic firm in the West have anything to do with
                innovation. The large firms in the West are not very different from the Soviet counterparts, they are hardly ever innovative. The innovation comes from below, from small firms that get created, and in a situation like today,
                where there is no good market for new products and enormous profits in monopolized businesses, all the capital goes to the giants, and you get a stagnant economy.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was one way to innovate in the Soviet Union, actually, which was when some big cheese came in and fired all the managers every 5 years. That’s pretty much what Stalin did. This produced a sort of turnover in the
                system, but this also involved mass jailing and executions, and horrible terror, and so on. The administrators hated the job insecurity of these types of purges, and made sure the top levels would keep them at their job,
                after Stalin died. But this is talking about a dead system, it’s not like anyone is advocating a return to the Soviet era.

                In the totalitarian Soviet Union, in the factories in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, you got paid proportionally for each “piece” you made (whatever you were making), so if you were making double, you took home double the pay.
                I am not advocating communism, but your idea that incentives don’t exist under socialism is mentally retarded. On communal farms, you would get paid based on the management structure of the farm, they were owned locally, so
                it would be based on your productivity on the farm, according to the management determination. These policies made people work about equally hard as they do under any other incentive system.
            </p>
            <p>
                When people talk about “incentives” under capitalism, they aren’t talking about these types of incentives, that is, getting paid for how much you make or for your productivity, but about the “incentive” to become obscenely
                wealthy through the competition to become a member of the owner class. This type of competition, unlike the competition to produce more and better stuff, doesn’t do anything at all to improve the economy, instead it produces
                monopolistic firms with no innovation. Nobody wants to work hard when you can just become Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, and rely on hired slaves to do your work for you, so that you can take home the profit.
            </p>
            <p>
                The end point of monopolization is a Soviet economy, with enormous dead entities holding the whole economy back. This is what happens when there is no conscious design of competitive and innovative markets, where people are
                able to earn according to their ability to produce.

                is the Bob Dylan recipe for celebrity— you work the left when you are obscure, and then switch to the right when you are getting powerful, so as to cement your power by appealing to the media owners, revealing which side you
                were really on all along. This idiotic recipe works naturally when you are on drugs, as the gradually declining IQ will lead you to conservatism eventually no matter where you start. It doesn’t work anymore, as online,

                There is no such thing as an employee that is worth $7.50 an hour. The price of labor is determined by supply and demand, and you can get away with paying someone $7.50 an hour only when this person has no choice, because if
                he doesn’t take your job, he has no job at all. This is a product of artificially produced unemployment, caused by a distribution problem in an industrial economy, where the money doesn’t go to the laborers because of
                unemployment, and the too-low demand by too-low wages spirals back to prevent full employment. In an economy with full employment, the mean employee salary rises to the exact level required to buy the maximum industrial
                output, which is roughly the GDP divided by the population, give or take a factor of 5, and we are nowhere near this level of wages, as the productive capacity of the US is nowhere near stretched by consumer purchases. There
                is a ton of productive capacity that is lying idle, and right now, banks won’t even lend to produce new industry, because there is no reasonable chance of getting any new consumer spending. This has been known for over a
                hundred years— the problem of low wages is caused by competition with the unemployed. Mandating a minimum wage never produces higher unemployment, it produces higher wages and lower unemployment, contrary to all idiotic
                predictions from the right (and in line with Keynsian predictions), until everyone is employed. Any further increase in minimum wage at this point just produces inflation, so it is also relatively harmless, compared to
                unemployment. The only time you need to worry about capital is when there are no institutions willing to invest. Under conditions of moderate inflation, they have no choice— invest, or lose money. This has been also
                understood for over 100 years.

                Exactly. Monstanto created a set of superficially attractive products whose intended effect is to produce a takeover of the seed business. Bundling is always “effective” for the consumer, because it saves people hassle. If
                you get IE with Windows, what’s the point of having Firefox? Why should you go to 6 separate private businesses, when you can just go to Walmart? This produces a Soviet economy, exactly one gigantic company for everything.
                Bundling is the essence of monopoly, it’s anti-competitive behavior, it gives the consumer a little bit of superficial convenience at the expense of the diversity of economic activity, and once you remove diversity from the
                seed stock trade, you kill an ancient tradition of seed stock evolution, and you lose thousands of years of biological heritage in favor of a nasty monoculture, and that’s the end of progress in agriculture, forever, except
                for the various iterations of stupid ideas that come from big business.
            </p>
            <p>
                Monopolies happen, they happen not by government meddling, but as a result of thousands of individual choices, which cumulatively are against the best interest of a healthy sector of the economy. That’s why we passed
                anti-trust law over a hundred years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                The answer to this is simply to avoid bundling insecticide with seed, and to avoid bundling herbicide resistance with seed. Adding vitamin A to rice, that’s pretty nifty, and it has no effect on competition, which is why it
                wasn’t done by a large corporation. It is also why one shouldn’t be blindly against GMOs, just against Monsanto GMOs, or other large corporate GMOs. These are just stupid GMOs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the government will sadly never enforce any regulation against the interest of big corporations anymore, not after Citizens United, it’s falls to the citizens to do it. Citizens given a choice to eat GMO corn or
                non-GMO corn will simply band together to get rid of GMO corn permanently, because of their collective revulsion at eating boatloads of Bt insecticide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Practices that are successful in the marketplace are not automatically good, they are only beneficial when they are competitive practices, that allow others to reproduce what you did, and the go a little further. Breeding a
                tastier tomato is just fine, nobody is going to regulate that, but if you try to produce a tomato whose sole purpose is to undercut all competition, you need to be controlled before you destroy the industry. Competition is
                not easy to maintain, it is already lost in most sectors of the US economy, because nobody cares to enforce anti-trust anymore.
            </p>
            <p>[here is a response to JP’s question below— who decides what things are “bundled” and what are not?]</p>
            <p>That is the most important question, it is the essence of the enforcement: what practices are anti-competitive, and what practices are not?</p>
            <p>
                Anti-trust law is a beast, because it is extremely flexible, and can be interpreted so loosely that nothing is a monopoly, so, for example, Amazon competes with my local bookstore. This loose interpretation is the current
                one, it was produced by Reagan appointees, and it pretty much continues under Clinton, Bush II, and Obama, with a handful of exceptions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conversely, anti-trust law can be interpreted insanely restrictively to argue that labor unions make monopolies on labor, as was done in the 1920s. The problem of enforcement and clarity is always there, which is why the
                justice department has lawyers looking over mergers, and other lawyers looking at specific anti-competitive complaints. It’s extremely big government, but it is recognized as important traditionally by both free-market
                libertarians and revolutionary socialists, it’s completely cross-party, and anti-trust enforcement is recognized as one of the most important functions of government world-wide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anti-trust regulation is always difficult, because you are asked to answer what activity of bundling are “in restraint of trade”, and what activity of bundling is just expanding business. It’s the question of what is
                “dumping” vs. “lowering prices”, “collusion” vs. “friendly implicit contracts”, “efficiency gains from merger” vs. “reduction of choice”. It’s extremely difficult to draw a firm line on anything at all. Nevertheless, by
                general agreement, putting internet explorer in the operating system, and putting insecticide in corn, should definitely be considered unacceptable bundling practices in any interpretation. The reason is that they shut out
                an enormous segment of the market for reasons that have very little to do with net benefits in the production cycle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The legal criterion is the nebulous assessment of whether you are allowing a fair environment for competitors. Can someone else fairly reproduce what you did? Can they come out with a reasonable competing product within a
                reasonable frame? Would you want them to?
            </p>
            <p>
                When you bundle insecticide with corn, and it is unlabelled, your efforts are not easily reproduced, they are of dubious benefit as compared to spraying the insecticide, and they are INTENSELY disliked by the public, who
                would prefer to separate the insecticide from the food by washing, and to not buy insecticide-laced corn, no matter how harmless the insecticide is purported to be. By preventing labelling, you prevent giving the public a
                choice. Even if it took no massive R&amp;D and it cost no money, other corn seed providers wouln’t necessarily want a Bt producing version of every corn variety they have. There is no clear efficiency gain in removing the
                separation between the insecticide and seed, spraying is not the most expensive thing in the world. This means that ultimately, disapproving of seed-insecticide genetic bundling is a sensible pro-competition policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                But although it is the government’s job to protect business from bundling, in this particular case, the consumers can do it all by themselves, if you just label the product. They will get rid of bundled Bt corn, while
                keeping golden rice, as consumers can be pretty good as sensing evil products when they put a mind to it. So in this case, nobody is asking for law-enforcement to do it, just for labelling to let the citizens do it all by
                themselves. That’s a no-brainer
            </p>
            <p>
                In other cases, where nobody can see the inner workings, it is often important for the government to be zealous in taking action, not punitive action against a firm for bundling so much as preventative action, to prevent
                this sort of activity from killing the industry. has been the source of INCREDIBLE amounts of litegation over the decades.
            </p>
            <p>
                But this is the standard position. If you ask my opinion, it is important to restructure corporate contract law and tax law to give companies an incentive to break up into smaller firms, without any direct intervention. With
                a graduated corporate income tax, and a good contract transparency and standardization law, you can ensure that companies will split up separate divisions that produce separate products, and collaborate through open
                contracts, not because anyone in the government made them do it by direct meddling, but just because it saves them money. This is my own position on anti-trust law, I don’t think anyone else shares it today.

                and the ten million (literally) other small farmers who can provide you with an unimaginably vaster diversity of seeds than any large monopolistic organization by small online orders, and who maintain the knowledge and

                age when picked, and the exact breed of all meat, and the animals’ age and weight. But I’m not the dictator of anything, so I take what I can get.

                Labelling fully will improve consumer choice, and it might perhaps allow tasty vegetables a market edge. It does go beyond GMOs, but my interests are in the market failures of agriculture in general, of which GMOs are only a
                small part. The main market failure is the tremendous regress in the quality of food in the first world. The only explanation for the market domination of crappy vegetables is that the consumer doesn’t know what exact kind
                of vegetable they are getting when they are buying it.

                I AM NOT claiming there is no competition TODAY, I know it’s still not hopeless. I am claiming there is a SERIOUS CREDIBLE THREAT to competition in the future, as seed diversity is radically plummetting already, wherever
                GMOs are introduced and take over, as small seed providers get locked out of the market by Monsanto, using GMO bundling tactics. The trend is now to monopolization, and the leader is Monsanto. It only uses GMOs for this
                purpose, achieving complete market dominance. If GMOs take over the corn market, corn seed diversity is destroyed, as all the local non-GMO corn varieties are put out of business, as it is impossible (and undesirable) for
                all the seed providers to make GMO modifications to all the stocks simultaneously, they’re small. This is TERRIBLE for agriculture, it is a potential loss of huge chunks of seed heritage.

                buying another operating system, there just ISN’T ONE, because nobody can compete in that sector anymore, even though the product is terrible. Still, you can install Linux, thankfully, but that’s a miracle you can’t expect
                in seeds The point of government anti-trust is to prevent loss of competition, but you can’t trust governments on this anymore. So the consumers can just do it by boycotting the product.

            <p>But “organic” doesn’t tell me if the tomato I am buying is an inedible”natural” polypoidy monster. It’s not just GMOs that are a problem, it’s all sorts of shitty food.</p>

            <p>Right, but, you know, aim at one target at a time. The GMO seeds make the practices worse, because the lock in is enforced by the genes. It’s another business destroyed by secrecy, IP, and ties to government.</p>
            <p>Lock in enforced by genes— means the corn expresses insecticide genetically, and you can’t swap out for a competing insecticide, nor can you take the insecticide and use it on your tomatoes.</p>
            <p>
                Secrecy— where did the Bt gene go? What parts of the promoter is expressed in plant? Which other protein networks in the plant are disrupted? Which non-coding RNA interaction cycles are disrupted? The majority of this is not
                deliberate secrecy, but ignorance, as the genetics of plants are extremely complicated, like the genetics of mammals. This is not like bacteria genetics.
            </p>
            <p>IP— patents, copyrights, and trademarks.</p>
            <p>
                Ties to government— Monsanto gives donations to Clinton, has advisors to Obama and Clinton, is consulted on all matters of agricultural policy, and can manipulate lab testing results by various tricks, to get past regulatory
                agencies. It has an army of lawyers, and it can manipulate US elections and policy by corporate contributions, like every other gigantic business. This does not involve any conspiracies.

                I gave you a MUCH MORE DETAILED answer than what you asked for. “Organic” is a useless label, it doesn’t tell you MUCH OF ANYTHING, as the organic standards are controlled by big agribusiness. Seed X and Seed Y tells you
                exactly what you’re buying. If you want to include “Fertilizer brand X”, that would be ok too, but I don’t care about that, and I don’t think anyone else does either.

                The vendor lock-in comes with bundling deals for products made by the same company— the herbicide goes with the seed. Like Internet Explorer comes with Microsoft Windows. This is the old Monsanto practice. The new monsanto
                practice is “you don’t need to spray anymore”. The seeds are simultaneously patented and secretive (paradox isn’t it! Patents are supposed to tell you how to do something), and the modifications are hard to reproduce. Not
                that anyone would want to reproduce these idiotic modifications. The business practices are odious, they are a repeat of other attempted monopolies, and they are reducing the diversity of seed stock, and putting the farming
                economy in danger.

                All foods should be labelled with the precise seed stock of all the ingredients, so that you know exactly WHICH mutated tomato you got (by seed ID), WHICH brand of apple, which brand of squash. That will save people trouble.
            </p>
            <p>
                The labelling of GMO food will not come with an “adverse health effects” sticker, it will just tell you what’s in your food, and where it came from. That’s the least you can do. There are possible serious health effects from
                trans-fats, but nobody is asking people to say that on the box, just to make sure people know what they are buying.
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing wrong with asking for labelling with INTENT TO KILL, that intent is not a problem. If you like GMOs, buy them! Convince your friends to buy them. There will always be a niche market.</p>

                Labelling is for WHATEVER THE CONSUMER WANTS TO KNOW. Yes, you do have the right to satisfy whatever activist demand you have. And you have the right to know which foods are bred with mutagens also, by more natural means. In
                fact, I’d like to know exactly what brand of seed grew the tomato I am buying, because those gigantic bright-red tomatoes taste like crap, and similar elephantine polyploidy-up-the-wazoo plants. If the consumer wants some
                information to make a purchasing decision, it MUST be provided, as anything else is a form of fraud.

                No! Not different. The same. Anti-GMO protesters have a right to “scare people”, and people have a right to either get scared, or not. Those little scary warnings on cigarette boxes, they give people information, people can
                choose. Likewise, ingredient labelling allows people to choose, and allows other people to try scare them about corn-syrup and nut allergies, and for people to make up their mind how much they want to be scared by it. YOU
                DON’T GET TO DECIDE FOR THEM, ASSHOLE.
            </p>
            <p>
                With labelling, it becomes the consumer’s choice whether to support the GMO product or to reject it. The antis are betting that the public will reject it, and since they are right, the only entity which is really scared here
                is Monsanto, as they know their business will collapse.
            </p>
            <p>I personally am not scared of eating GMOs, I just don’t like Monsanto, as their business practices are monopolistic and corrupt. So I will not buy Monsanto GMOs, but maybe someone else’s, I’ll buy.</p>
            <p>
                The person forced to buy GMOs is anyone who purchases a product without a label. It is idiotic to force people to buy in ignorance because your product won’t survive with full information to the consumer, it’s a form of
                fraud.

            </p>
            <p>I don’t want to eat GMOs, not because I intrinisically hate GMOs, but because I don’t like MONSANTO, and I want to help put them out of business.</p>

                You dipstick, there’s a question of quantity— when you spray Bt, you can wash it off, it’s on the surface. When you put Bt in the genes, you can’t wash it off. The amount of Bt matters, and it’s always up to consumers to
                decide what to eat.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Bt not going to kill you, it’s not going to give you cancer, but it might give you a bit of unpleasant bowel movements, and WHATEVER THE HECK IT DOES, it’s not up to YOU to decide what OTHER PEOPLE EAT! Your position is
                infantile— if people don’t want to eat corn-syrup or palm oil, for WHATEVER REASON, no matter how much you disagree with it, it’s THEIR DAMN CHOICE, NOT YOURS, and you have no business making it for them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only way to fix agribusiness is to allow the consumer full informed choice. Not choosing GMOs is the tip of the iceberg, I wouldn’t choose those horrid tomatoes and cantalopes which are bred to be gigantic either,
                because they taste like crap.

                Private competitive corporations simply can’t do research in any meaningful way, which is why we have an NSF. In order to do research, you need a safe place with safe funding, and freedom, and corporations have pressure to
                remove research branches, whose profits always come in a too distant future. The only corporations which could do research were monopolies like Bell, which were forced to spin off their labs into separate companies when they
                became competitive. Science and corporations don’t mix so well, sorry to tell you, profits don’t come to the first scientific inventors, but to the second in line who commercialize the product, nearly always a different set
                of people than the first.

                Bullshit. The famines of the last 100 years have not been caused by crop failures, but by political failures like collectivization or war. Anyway, GMO/non-GMO have nothing to do with this, they encourage crop failure
                slightly by monoculture, but this is not the main problem with them.

                The food tastes better because it’s from a local tradition, and isn’t bred to be 8 times the size by polyploidy. Whenever the farmers start using US agricultural seed stock, or US practices, the vegetable quality plummets.
                The transformation of Israeli vegetables from “tasty” to “tasteless” happened in the late 1990s, and people REMEMBER, and they COMPLAIN, but there’s nothing you can do about it as a consumer, because you don’t know what
                you’re buying until you get home, and American vegetables LOOK really good, they just taste awful. I don’t know what caused it exactly, but it was like day and night, but it has nothing to do with freshness. US vegetables
                suck because of their breeding, and they suck just as bad even when you get it direct from the field.

                How the heck can I know when I buy an ear of corn if it’s GMO or not? My goal as a consumer is not to “shop organic”, it’s just to put Monsanto out of business. “Organic” is simply a marketing ploy, a tool exploited by large
                businesses to sell food at tiered prices to the bourgoisie and proletariat, much like the different brands of detergent, and the different classes of watches and pens. They’re goal is to put small businesses out of business.
                So I don’t have any interest in buying “organic”. I want to buy “non-Monsanto”, not “organic”.

                Sprayed on Bt is easy to WASH OFF. On the other hand, EXPRESSED Bt is IMPOSSIBLE TO WASH OFF, because it’s inside the kernels themselves, it’s part of the plant now. It may be “totally nonlethal” and “totally nonmeasurable”
                in its impact, but you can’t say it’s “totally harmless” with a straight face, because that’s not YOUR CALL TO MAKE FOR OTHER PEOPLE. If you want to eat Bt, I’ll prepare you some Bt soup, and Bt jam on Bt bread, and GO
                CRAZY, you can pig out on Bt all day long, But it’s not your place to make that decision of what to ingest FOR OTHER PEOPLE, who are not interested in a Bt smorgasborg. Whether to ingest Bt or not, that’s the consumer’s call
                to make. You know that some people think sugar is harmful, others think corn syrup is terrible, and others won’t eat coconut or palm oils. Those are much more obviously harmless than Bt proteins, and yet, all of them are
                able to see explicitly when that stuff is in their food, and make that decision themselves.

                Dude, stop being an idiot. Third world food is better in every way, as anyone who ever ate fruit and vegetables outside the US (and now, unfortunately, Europe also) will attest. American agriculture produces crap food, and
                extremely unhealthy people. Only US meat is reasonably tasty, but even the livestock breeds are more diversified in every other part of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Famines are caused by war and lack of money, not lack of food, at least for the last 80 years. Monstanto does nothing to prevent famine, they make the situation worse. First world agriculture is done by gigantic corporations
                with enormous government subsidies. They corporations don’t give a damn about diversified practices, or diversified genetics, and they only care how big their fruit is. They’ll breed (natural) mutant plants that are two to
                three times normal size exploiting “natural” polyploidy, and these plants are terrible tasting and would lose in any market competition to traditional crops, except you can’t taste your fruit at the supermarket.

                The destruction of first world agriculture happened a while ago, and it s spreading by gradual infestation to other countries. In Israel, you could get good vegetables until only about a decade ago, now they are just the

                . It seems that animals fed Bt proteins (the insecticide corn expresses) get runny stools. Now, I don’t think that’s the worst thing in the world, it’s similar to Olestra (if you remember that), but it’s not inert, and it’s
                not benign, and the public rejected Olestra too.

                This isn’t golden rice we’re talking about, it’s a plant that expresses a mild toxin throughout it’s flesh. That’s what corporations produce, they are not responsible enough to be given control of the food supply, no large
                entity is. Food production has been a distributed industry in most of the world, and when it is taken over by large agribusiness, that’s the end of your ability as a consumer to buy a Cantaloupe that doesn’t taste like

                Yeah, yeah. The good Soviet seeds were marginalized by the incompetent Soviet government, which is the usual thing in communism. Good stuff from the bottom, suppressed by ruthless stupidity at the top. They had a top seed
                guy scour the world to produce the best and most diverse seed collection known to man, people starved to death protecting the seeds during the siege of Leningrad, and yet the seeds were ignored and misused during the Lysenko
                period. The fellow who created the collection was executed by Stalin for political opposition to Lysenkoism. But the seeds did find some use later, during the Khruschev era. These seeds were not patented.
            </p>
            <p>
                Seed breeding is not the hardest of science, and when it is done OUT IN THE OPEN, it is extremely beneficial, including GMOs. But when it’s done by private parties seeking a monopoly, it’s a catastrophe through and through.
                This is an economic argument, decrying monopolies, it is not anti-progress, it is anti-corporatism. I am sorry that you can’t see it, but you are too blinded by self interest.

            <p>
                There is no case where “90% marketshare” is won by a good product. Microsoft Windows is a disaster, likewise for Verizon internet, or whatever other monopolized service you’ve gotten. The essence of progress is healthy
                competition. These seed policies are destroying the economic competition, and not by producing a better product, but by bundling herbicide and pesticide “solutions” that are easy, but costly in long-term consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no way that you can tell me that a bundling of pesticide into corn is a better idea than spraying corn, it’s absurd. These are not sophisticated gene insertions, and the toxins involved are not neutral to animals,
                they cause minor problems, and we don’t know what they do exactly to mammals. The bundled seed product is just a little easier for a farmer, it comes with a large corporate guarantee, and it’s selling the farming community
                up the river. It’s certainly not a question of disliking science, as I said, I like academic GMOs just fine. it’s a question of deliberate monopolistic practices, business infiltrating the FDA and manipulating safety
                standards, and slowly producing an anti-competitive stranglehold on humanity’s oldest industry.

                These are not individual farmers, they are factory farms, and the “return on investment” is a deal with the company to provide herbicide for free, or some other monopoly-bundling nonsense. I don’t know the business aspect
                very well, but I do know the biology, and it sucks balls. These companies should not exist, they have been a net negative for agriculture. Compare them with the socialist breeders of the 1960s, who brought you the modern
                agricultural revolution, this is the usual capitalist perversion of progress into regress.

                Yeah, you’re right. But that’s not a policy. You can’t fix it by turning off the money, you would just plunge the nation into depression, because tight money means layoffs and businesses closing. The only way to fix it that
                I see is to break up the big banks in a targeted way, tax wall street in a targeted way, and have progressive taxation work its magic as best it can, and then invest the tax money in jobs, research, and so on. I don’t have
                all the answers, but complaining is not a prescription either. I see the problem, but that’s not a solution. It’s not like I was a big fan of TARP, but without a stimulus, you have 1929 all over again.

                Yes, the artificial stimulus to Wall Street is a serious problem, but what do you want people to do? Priniting money is not done because it is good for wall street, but because the economy has too low demand, and the goal is
                to put the money in the pockets of workers, not in the hands of wall street. But it’s tough when banks are not lending. I mean, I’m supporting Bernie Sanders for this reason, because he really will break up the big
                wall-street investment banks, and tax transactions to remove horrors like microtrading and generate revenue. With competition, you won’t see the kind of systematic rip-off that has happened until now. There is also a
                proposal for more direct methods of transferring wealth to low-income folks, like hiring people to build roads and bridges. But it’s next to impossible to do anti-depression spending in our economy without propping up wall
                street, because they stand between the Fed and the public. Do I like it? No. But can I do anything about it? Not really. You can’t expect that increasing rates will improve the economy, that’s what they did in 1929.

                It is IDIOTIC to compare breeding to GM. Breeding introduces alternate configurations of proteins, at random, but you know what those proteins are, and what they do, because they are a combination of the proteins in the
                plants you breed. It is next to impossible to mutate a plant protein into a toxin by breeding, you would have to cross a plant with a known toxic plant, and nobody would ever do that. Maybe you could breed an almond to
                concentrate cyanide. But nobody would ever do that either, and you couldn’t do it by accident, you would need to select for cyanide content.
            </p>

                GM introduces a completely alien modification, whose result must be tested much more thoroughly in order to ensure safety, and yet the testing is done by agencies in the pocket of the industry. Further, the modifications are
                not essential, they are just for the purpose of vendor-lock-in and commercial domination, they work no miracle on the plant itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                The genes introduced for herbicide resistance lead farmers to overuse herbicides, and increase the level of herbicide in food indirectly through this. They are also pointless, as farmers should just weed a little better
                instead. The genes introduced for pest control express pesticides directly in the plant bulk, and lead to chronic ingesting of (very mild) toxins by every consumer. Spraying is the classical way to introduce pesticide, and
                then you wash it off. You can’t wash off pesticide in the genes, and whether it’s classified as harmful or not, I don’t want to eat pesticide, and neither do you.
            </p>
            <p>
                The results of these pathetic gene insertions are not worth the effort and cost, as the change in yeild is insignificant compared to traditional methods and selective breeding, it’s a zero on yeilds. But by using predatory
                pricing and patent lock-in, together with brand advertisment and propaganda, a gigantic firm like Monsanto aims to remove competition, and position itself as the sole provider of patented seeds to farmers. This is abhorrent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even breeded and patented seeds are not a great idea, but breeding is easy to reproduce independently, and has no potential danger. If the modifications were more substantial, like actually introducing serious modifications,
                I would like it. But they are pathetic modifications, the kind of thing you learn in “gene transfer 101”.

                The economic dangers of this are obvious, as the worst-case scenario already happened in Tech, with Microsoft, Apple, and Google destroying the entire ecosystem with monopolistic practices and takeovers. When you allow
                gigantic private corporations to dominate a market sector, efficiency plummets, and you get crap products. Universally.

            <p>Farmers don’t see “much higher yeilds”, there is no intrinsic difference in yeilds. They see perhaps a lower pesticide bill, or a discount on their seed price.</p>
            <p>
                I am not against modifying plants on principle, I like the idea of artificial biology. But the point of GMO as practiced by Monsanto is vendor lock-in and monopolization of world agriculture, and it must be resisted the same
                way Microsoft is resisted. The catastrophe Microsoft caused (and Google is now causing) to the tech industry must not be repeated in agriculture.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dangers of GMO are not so much to health of human beings, as to the health of the world’s farming economy. If all IP is lifted, if all seeds are free to breed, and if you don’t keep secrets, it can be a useful
                technology. The current system is developing it into a proprietary monstrosity, whose only effect is destruction of the diversity of seed stock, and a takeover of third-world agriculture by inefficient monopolistic first
                world business. First world agriculture is already busted, unfortunately, and it would take a lot of activism to get it healthy.

                It’s not anti-science. The modifications to crops are simply a vendor-lock-in, and encourage over-use of pesticides, or in themselves constitue plants which generate toxic pesticide compounds throughout their bulk, not just
                sprayed on the surface. The safety testing is nonexistent, there are no benefits in yeilds over selective breeding, and there are much better ways of introducing genetic modifications than having a big corporate entity do
                it. There are research universities that do this sort of thing with careful controls, and no manipulation power to skew test results their way, and no profit motive to do so. You are risking the monopolization of
                agribusiness when you support Monsanto, and Bernie Sanders should promise libre-seeds forever. Seeds, like software, are better when they are free.

                here to argue about why we’re not here. But it’s not clear how common stable Solar Systems are. Stars are stable for longer than 5 billion years, but planets can drift all around, and they don’t need to be in stable orbits,
                I mean, so many gas giants have migrated to get close to their star. It’s totally open, it’s important to know.

                Darwin made no claim about the mutations being “genetic damage”. This hypothesis is the result of the fruit-fly experiments in radiation from the 1950s, where it was discovered that mutation rate is proportional to
                chromosome damage. But the mutations themselves, when they aren’t protein mutations are NOT random, they are controlled by RNA networks, and the result is much closer to intelligent design than to modern synthesis, because
                the mechanism of rewriting DNA is authorly, proceeding by inserting functional chunks into the genome, not by any random process. The random hypothesis is simply impossible, the IDers are right about this.

                Mutations are not “completely random”, they are very purposeful, biologists have been misled by looking at protein coding regions, where incidental rare mutations (like sickle cell) occur. Most mutations are in non-coding
                regions, and very tightly regulated by RNA networks. That’s not accepted yet, but it explains the main source of friction between biologists and anti-evolutionists. It’s a form of intelligent design, but the designer isn’t
                God. It’s RNA.

                Cool! I guess it wasn’t new to me. I thought of it in 2014. I didn’t see this before. The answer to the question is “obviously not random”, but you have to understand the current brain-dead consensus in biology—- they think
                the retroviral sequences come from ACTUAL VIRUSES. That’s as idiotic as denying evolution, and it’s a mainstream position today.

                The question is how the crossing over happens in those individuals when they try to reproduce. It requires new biology to line up 2 chromosomes with one. I am not denying that it happens, I am pointing out that it requires
                new biology to make it work, because you need a way of organzing the chromosomes in partnered pairs along a split/merge and then decide how to produce the offspring crossing over. This requires a brainier RNA network in egg
                cells than what is normally assumed by biologists, the RNA has to line up corresponding chromosomes with each other correctly, and this is not a trivial feat for the network. I agree with you on the facts, although I am not
                sure about the viability statistics of the offspring of chromosome-merged and chromosome normal humans.

                No, I just didn’t know about the “vestigial telomeres”, your comment is the first time I heard of it. But I should look at the sequences myself, because there is a lot of “telomere-like” sequence in the middle of
                chromosomes, there are lots of embedded repeats, and it is possible that the split occured in the telomere-like region instead. I don’t know if anyone else proposed this, but it must be investigated without bias. If the
                telomere regions are more likely from a merge, I have to change the assessment of course.
            </p>
            <p>
                The common-ancestry is not the issue with the chromosome merge, but the mechanism of merger is completely unknown. To merge chromosomes, you need a mechanism that can do it, and the presently acknowledged mechanisms are too
                dumb to do it, as they assume chromosomes blindly line up. The real mechanism must involve non-coding RNA linking up the chromosomes in corresponding parts, and it needs to work with split and merged chromosomes, because we
                know this has happened in history. It’s the strongest argument they have, because it really requires new mechanisms of biology, all the rest of the stuff they say is drivel.

                This is nothing like XXY syndrome, inXXY mitosis, you separate the chromosomes individually, and you still end up producing some normal sperm. For merged chromosomes, it’s not like that. and it is not at all clear that the
                Chromosome 2 merged in humans, it probably SPLIT in Chimps (I think the latter is much easier to explain than a merge). Either way, merge or split, you need to get the sperm and egg to reattach the parts to do crossing over
                on the split/merged segment, so that the offspring are not less fit. This requires a more sophisticated crossing over machinery than what is usually admitted to. This is a theoretical prediction that must be confirmed,
                because we know the split/merge happened hisotrically, and it is a new prediction, nobody says what I just said.

                mostly a clock for species divergence.

                No, this is false. The “direction” is maximizing the computational complexity of the totality of life, and it doesn’t go backwards, barring a catstrophic event, like a meteor impact. This is evolution propaganda with no
                evidence you are citing. Compare Cambrian life to modern life, or even dinosaurs to birds, and you see the sophistication of the parts increases steadily with time, especially the brain. There were no talking parrots

                Those diseases and disabilities are not hereditary. It’s all like this, all our “attractiveness” traits are really future fitness traits, and among them, humor, vitality, youth, strength, height, and good secondary sexual
                characteristics are the most prominent. Evolution works at the bottom, weeding out the 10% of humans who won’t reproduce in each generation, it doesn’t work at the top, because the top is hard to identify. Who knows who is
                the “most fit”, nobody does. But we know who the least fit person is, unfortunately, because nobody wants to go on a date with him.

                Unfortunately, it is true. The methods our sexual selection uses for determining intelligence are much more accurate than our psychological testing. We use “sense of humor” and “vivacity”, which are a natural intelligence
                test that is used for reproduction selection. In addition to humor and wit, we also choose fit, strong, vigorous people to reproduce with, regardless of gender.

                extremely small modifications, and completely obvious under natural selection and normal mutation, you have no idea where they came in, as they could mutate in human or chimp ancestors, or in a common ancestor, or anywhere.

                RNA from RNA networks using actual reverse-transcriptase, through mechanisms like reverse-transcribing ERVs (endo-retro-viruses— they’re 40% of the human genome). These modifications produce very intelligent mutations.

                No, the evolution to a new host is by spot mutation of something like 4 positions on some protein alleles, they are very limited in thier parameter space, as their evolution is by protein. To evolve to “no host at all” never
                happens with a flu virus, it requires a virus that is descended from a parasitic bacterium, and even then, only if there is enough “bacterium” left to survive without the host. I am afraid this is a terrible example, viruses
                are highly degenerate things, especially flu viruses, which are 8 proteins and a shell, infinitely far away from enough to be self-sustaining.

                Do you really think that the population of 10,000 that were this common ancestor left bones around we can find? The chances are 0%, we’ll never find fossils of them, we aren’t that lucky, and even if we did, we wouldn’t know
                it for what it was. The inference of a common ancestor is obvious by looking at DNA sequences (as well as homologous characteristics, other fossils, and so on). It’s not a bluff, it’s an obvious inference if you look at
                protein sequences and time their divergence. Stop being retarded.

                There are about 5,000 ape-shaped creatures around us, always on the verge of extinction. There are 7,000,000,000 human shaped creatures. If we keep going the way we are going, there will be NO MORE ape-shaped creatures among
                us, and that will be the tragic “completion” of the process of evolution as you ask it to happen. Do you really want that to happen? Evolution is not a nice process, it doesn’t involve coordinated planned change, it involves
                brutal species destruction, and you should be grateful that this destruction is not yet complete on apes, and hopefully, if we get our conservation act together, will never be.

                I am giving you a reasonable answer, made up, like your stupid bloodline story. Really, focus on the split Chromosome, it’s a FAR better case for your position. How the heck did the first split chromosome ancestor Chimp have
                viable children with non-split chromosome partners? That is required if chimps and humans share a common ancestor, and modern split-chromosome babies are usually non-viable, and extremely negatively impacted, and usually
                sterile. To explain this event requires an actual modification to modern genetics, which is not widely recognized in mainstream biology. Your blood-type nonsense is a property of blood proteins, and it is entirely explained
                by ordinary selection on gene alleles.

                on, stop being stupid, this is not a mystery if you know how DNA evolves. A better question you should have asked is how the Human Chromosome split into two in Chimps— this is a bit stronger mystery.

                The form of government is not in question, nobody is contesting it, a Democratic republic is a good form of government regardless of economic policy. Human nature is not the issue either, human nature is a mixed bag. The

                I despise Reagan, but I have to admit that Ronald Reagan advocated widespread ownership of enterprises through employee equity packages, with the hope of creating “The Ownership Society”, something Bush 1, Clinton, and Bush
                2 echoed. This benign idea of enterprise ownership distributed to employees gradually perverted itself into a program of lavish stock options for upper management, boosting inequality instead of reducing it. The reason the
                outcome was opposite of the intent is because conservatives can’t fight structural perversions of egalitarian ideas, because they don’t understand the class structure, and how political decisions work in a class system.
                Socialists do understand this, and when Socialists implement distributed ownership, the ownership really is distributed more broadly.

                The most important element of socialism is fixing the market failures in modern capitalism. This can be done coercively, but then the cure is worse than the disease. The correct way is to do it non-coercively, as distributed
                ownership and distributed decision making is truly more efficient, and can easily win a fair competition. Like Linux.

                The record of socialist policy is relatively good, and it only gets better when it is stripped of any element of coercion. Socialism is not an intrinsically coercive position, it is not pointing a gun and taking stuff,
                despite your indoctrination, and despite the fact that it was like this in China and in the USSR. Socialism is intrinsically an outgrowth of modern economics that identifies the fundamental sources of market failures,
                realistically analyzes the social forces that makes them hard to fix, and adjusts public policy to turn these market failures into market successes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The interests that oppose fixing market failures are those that profit from these failures, which means large monopolistic business, their managers and owners, and the monopolized large media. These will not benefit from
                competition, as in a market, their wages would regress to the mean, and they know it. Socialism is the only method to approach a textbook competitive Capitalist equilibrium most closely, despite the fact that this sounds
                paradoxical.
            </p>
            <p>
                The opposition to competition within the market system is the main source of conflict inside the political system— owners do not want to compete with anyone, they want their employees to compete with as large and desperate a
                pool of unemployed and destitute people as possible, and they buy out the government to ensure that this happens. This situation is what Marx called “The Class Struggle”, and it manifests itself not just in policies that
                allow formation of monopolies, and gross inequities in ownership and compensation, but in an overwhelming blast of facile analysis that brainwashes people into thinking that these perversions of market equilibrium are doing
                anyone any good. These are contrary to Capitalist theory and Socialist theory both, but only the socialists ever do anything about it.

                In every country outside the Soviet sphere of influence, socialist policies have been a tremendous success, as these policies produced the post-war economic boom. Socialism is not something that you should attach to Soviet
                famines, any more than you should attach Capitalism to the Irish famine, which was produced by Laissez-faire economists in England. The issue in these famine is power and neglect, which happens whenever you try to put a
                large number of people under the yoke of a small number of people, whether in England or in Russia.

                because it is a living art-form that inspires the whole world, from France to South Africa, to Palestine, to create new worlds out of their minds. There are plenty of great African American academics, the greatest in their
                fields, people like Maryland’s Gates in Supersymmetry, W.E.B DuBois in history, but that neurosurgeon clown running for president is not one of them. While I am not Sub-Saharan, I am half African, and if colonialism went the
                other way, I would probably be classified as borderline, but passably black, as the power structure would expand to blackify rather than whitify. But regardless, all this black/white American nonsense is extremely

                It’s a new kind of socialism, one that you haven’t seen before, at least not if you haven’t run Linux yet. Linux is a socialist kind of product, it is free to modify and the modifications are again free to view and modify
                themselves. This kind of freedom encourages individual worker control of the means of production (in this case software), but in a different way, involving freedom and voluntary choice, not state coercion, and in a way
                compatible with many small market driven firms that can and do make a reasonable profit, and are collectively about ten times more efficient than any large corporate competitor. Compare the Git commits for Linux with the
                changes in corporate rivals, like Microsoft Windows, and you will see that Linux is about 10 times faster to innovate. Nobody confiscated anything to make Linux.

                The crony deals occur mainly between private parties. When Walmart took over from thousands of small private businesses, the government had no part in this. It did so by demanding special prices from suppliers, by threat of

                broken up into smithereens, and that the tax code ensures that even when Capitalism fails, income is confiscated and redistributed, so as to approximate market equilibrium anyway.

                Marx’s central contribution to economics was the observation that Say’s law is false, that demand in a market economy is not usually sufficient to purchase the industrial output. This observation is routine today, it is
                echoed by Keynes, but Marx was there first, as this is the main thesis that he pushes. This was amply verified in every depression before and since.

                I am not a dreamer in any sense of the word, because the time for dreaming has long come and gone, the time for dreaming was probably in Spain in 1936. The prescriptions of Marx have ossified by now into standard textbook
                Keynsianism in economics, and the goal of modern social democrats is to get 50% of the desired benefits of socialism just by taxation and monetary policy, to mitigate the market failure Marx identified, namely that workers
                are not paid enough, because they compete with the unemployed for jobs.

                The total Republican rejection of Keynsian economics, beginning with Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan in the late 1970s and early 1980s, following right-wing economic quacks, is one of the great stupidities in public
                policy in all of human history. Was it really necessary to go through the great depression a second time to learn that Marx had it right, and demand is not optimally adjusted by markets?

                My own preferred brand of socialism is further left than Bernie Sanders, and involves stronger structural incentives to keep firms small, instead of bureaucratic anti-trust law, a reworked contract law to prevent
                exploitative contracts between firms (including outlawing special pricing to friends) but without oversight (you can do it by a trick of using pre-specified standardized contract language, as tinker-toys to build up complex
                contracts from simple ones with standard language), and non-governmental efforts to induce worker control of industry, without coercion, by voluntary consumer and labor choices. People prefer to work where they can have a
                say, people prefer to buy from nice businesses, and businesses that listen to all their employees are more efficient anyway, so you don’t need a government forcing people to do anything, this can be a voluntary revolution
                which takes over gradually, as it already has to a great extent in the free software world.

                Mexico’s problems are largely caused by drug lords running amok, which is entirely fueled by the insane US demand for cocaine, demand which should be zero, considering the brain-damage that this awful drug reliably produces.
                With a sensible treatment policy, something proposed by Sanders, perhaps this problem can be relegated to the past, as after all, cocaine is not expensive to produce in bulk, and it should be easy to wean addicts off of it
                when there is a productive avenue available for them to channel their resources. People don’t become addicts when they have a good job and a significant say in how their workplace is run.

                the evaporating social safety net, the breaking of the social contract, and the production of wage slavery at low wages for the majority of people, it destroys the ability to do productive new things, as people can’t
                innovate when they are trapped in their jobs by economic pressure. There is no benefit to the type of Capitalism practiced by the US since 1980, Rambo movies are simply not very good, neither is Microsoft Windows. Linux is

                economics, for example, predicting price hyperinflation in response to the Bush and Obama stimulus packages (and similarly in response to the Russian money printing episode in the late 1990s). These predictions never
                materialize, they always fail, and predictably so, because these are predictions in equilibrium, and inflation doesn’t kick in until the productive capacity is stretched when you are out of equilibrium. This is something
                from Keynes 101, but they get it wrong again, and again, and again, and each time, it’s a different blathering excuse for why the prediction failed.

                When I say “equal”, I don’t mean “exactly equal”, I mean “competitively roughly equal”, which is what competition produces, and it translates to “equal up to about a factor of 10”, so an electrical engineer patents

                for them are deluded kids, insane people, or those who only chase after money and power.

                An organization with zero percent support can be destroyed just by funding the opposition. The problem is that Assad has only 10% support too, so it is hard to find who to help. The Kurds are the true popular movement in the
                region, and they have solid Kurdish support, and they fight ISIS back successfully, and they will win if they are funded. But Turkey won’t like it, because if they win, they will form a state, with a chunk of Turkey cut out.
                So Turkey is dithering on ISIS, and there is no excuse for this. The Kurds have been oppressed enough, doesn’t the principle of self-determination apply even when it annoys an ally?

                ISIS in Lebanon has the support of exactly 0% of the population, it was polled just a few days ago. I mean, the political support for ISIS was greater in Belgium or in Switzerland than it is in Lebanon. It is the same 0% in
                Syria, except you can’t poll the regions terrorized by ISIS, where people are not free to speak. The only supporters of ISIS are those who are directly paid by the organization, mostly young and mentally retarded. It is
                roughly the same all across the Muslim world, at least wherever people have a clue what ISIS is. The only support ISIS gets are from people who don’t know who they are.
            </p>
            <p>
                ISIS is not a grassroots organization, it is a creation of Western intelligence agencies, whose goal was to destabilize Syria, that operated on naked power and acquisition of resources, instead of through persuasion. It
                seems that it is now financially independent. That means it is a terrible problem, but it doesn’t mean it has any more popular support. There is ZERO support for ISIS in the region, and this is in stark contrast with the
                IRA, who had some minority support in Ireland, or the Basque insurgents, who had perhaps majority support, or the Chechnyans.

                The founders ideas were antiquated, but not unworkable. They are not opposed to modern economics, they are just corrupted a bit because the founders were largely large landholders and slave-holders. But they weren’t stupid
                slave-holders, they were relatively smart, so the framework of the constitution is a great advance, as it guarantees civil liberties, it guarantees freedom from confiscation and intrusion from the government, and allows you
                a guarantee of security in your ventures that other countries didn’t have until the 20th century. The US constitution is one of the great documents in history, but the type of socialist reforms one is talking about don’t
                involve confiscation of property, or onerous regulation, they involve structural changes that encourage widespread ownership of property. They are not incompatible with the constitution, which, by the way, institutes a
                rather terrible form of socialism in the Federal Post Office.

                Sorry, it is you who is the idiot. Socialist economics is something that does not require government takeover of industry, the point is to distribute ownership broadly, and this is something that even the Reaganites called
                for in the 1980s (if you remember). The stock incentives of the 1980s were supposed to produce socialism through capitalism, by distributing equity. This of course did not work, because equity went to managers in the form of
                options, and produced even more perverse inequalities than what was there before.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mild policies persued by Bernie Sanders are not even close to the type of changes that are required to make an efficient economy, but they are a small step in the right direction. Further steps, which are probably not
                endorsed by Sanders, would ensure that corporations stay small and nimble without heavy-handed anti-trust meddling, and that ownership stays distributed by incentives and contract law, not by government takeover. This is
                much more difficult to do than nationalizing industries, but it is in line with ideal efficient market theory and socialist theory both, so it is the correct policy.

                The key point is that income distribution is not going according to the model of competitive equilibrium. In capitalist equilibrium, in theory, all incomes are supposed to be roughly the same, because if someone is making
                more money than you, you just go do what that person is doing, until the supply and demand equalize. It only takes a tiny surplus of people who can replace you to drive your salary to market mean, ask a computer programmer,
                and they’ll tell you it’s true.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point is that ownership of capital produces rent-seeking behavior that pushes you away from equilibrium. There is no competition for rent-seeking positions, they are filled by a political process. The incentives to start
                a business need to be a healthy profit, but a healthy profit is not produced by starting a small business today, but by politically rising to a position of power within an already monopolized industry. These incentives are
                corrosive to free market capitalism, because they take you further away from equilibrium, allowing some people to starve, and others to siphon off industrial profits into their pockets.
            </p>
            <p>
                This situation is destructive, it ruins lives, and it also ruins entrepreneurship, because when you have exhorbitant monopolistic profits to find, investors no longer want to put money in small competitive firms, because
                these small firms have no chance against the big firms, even when their product is better. Even when they can compete in the market, they can’t offer the same absurd rate of return of a monopoly like Facebook, or Amazon. In
                this situation of monopolistic takeover of the economy, it is important to restore competition by progressive taxation and anti-trust enforcement, which hasn’t happened in the US in any serious way in over 40 years. It was
                done throughout the first half of the twentieth century with great success, breaking up Standard Oil, AT&amp;T, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last significant anti-trust effort was against Microsoft, and it failed miserably, ensuring the horrible situation in computer software will not be fixed for another generation. The previous anti-trust effort was the
                communication deregulation act of 1996, which broke up and deregulated AT&amp;T, and led to the internet boom. There is no case where a pro-competition policy has produced less growth, it’s always good, and enforcement of
                the Sherman act has only stopped because politicians are beholden to the billionaires who sit at the top of large corporations. From Grayhound, to Walmart, to Oracle, the whole economy is dominated by monopolies, with the
                only healthy parts being the exceptions to the rule, like the thriving small Linux industry.

                You really need to understand what markets theoretical equilibrium looks like. It doesn’t look like real markets in the US today, it looks like something crazily idealistic that you’ve never seen before. Pareto demonstrated
                that the ideal of capitalist equilibrium is indistinguishable from perfect omniscient and benevolent planning. The Capitalist competitive equilibrium is what socialism is striving to approximate, when it works well.

                You think my positions were popular in American institutions of higher education? They were last popular around 1969, all the socialists have been purged from American higher education starting in the 1970s, intensifying in
                the 1980s, and completed in the 1990s, so that by and large, American universities are now, like the media, barren wastelands of idiot conservatism, with a tiny handful of very old die-hards like Chomsky talking to
                themselves without anyone listening. I had to arrive at my position long before I went to University, and I had to avoid all (humanities) University classes in order to maintain it, because the classes were dominated by

                Socialism has nothing necessarily to do with government takeover of industry, that’s the split between the Anarchist socialists and the Government socialists. The government socialists are exemplified by Vladimir Lenin and
                Fidel Castro, the Anarchist socialists are exemplified by George Orwell and Milovan Đilas. The goal of Keynsianism, as practised by Clement Atlee, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and Richard Nixon, is to fix the problems
                identified by Marx within Capitalism by monetary policy and minimum wage, while the goal of slightly more left socialists is to ensure widely distributed ownership of businesses to their employees. Both are not in themselves
                condusive to government intrusion, as they don’t need to be enforced top-down by heavy handed intervention, simple incentives and progressive taxation should be enough to ensure roughly spread out ownership of industry.

                That depends strongly on the flavor of socialism you are talking about. In the USSR case, it did exactly what you said, it created enormous monopolized industries for every sector of the economy, and placed control of these
                industries in state ministries that nobody but a tiny handful of people had any power over.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the case of Yugoslavia, or Northern Europe, socialism diversified ownership by encouraging workers to own more capital themselves. The northern European countries, Sweden, Denmark, etc, explicitly took their cues from
                Yugoslavia in the late 1960s, after the repression had largely ended, not at all from the USSR, and they didn’t concentrate ownership into large state monopolies, but had a healthy market economy with lots of smaller firms
                widespread ownership distributed among as many people as possible. This is what Bernie Sanders is talking about (if you take his socialism seriously, which it is not clear one should), and he doesn’t plan on coercing
                anything, simply providing social Democracy, and some incentives to local ownership, while breaking up monopolies. All of these activities are within the mainstream in the US, and would have been endorsed by Teddy Roosevelt
                and Dwight Eisenhower, let alone Franklin Delano Roosevelt or Martin Luther King Jr.

                The issue with socialism is that it is very easy for power-hungry government officials to abuse it to exert undue control over industries, and destroy entire economies by destroying entrepreneurship. This is not a necessary
                part of socialism, this is the downfall of Leninism.

                The Mossad can arrange the demolition very easily, it doesn’t even need to be the whole Mossad, just a few agents. But they can’t arrange the military drills, and they certainly can’t pay agents any amount of money to hijack
                airplanes and crash them into buildings. The Mossad is not a savory institution, and it works in conjunction with the CIA, but even the CIA wouldn’t do this in whole, it would only be a few individuals here and there at

                It is not possible to blame Israel for this, because Israel just couldn’t do it. They have no control over American airspace, and they have no real Israeli motive for this, as unless you are in the administration and can
                control what the response is going to be, the effects are unpredictable. I mean, the US could have entirely pulled out of the Levant and adjacent regions in response to 9/11, for all that Netanyahu knew in 2000, and focused
                all resources on Afghanistan. Where you should examine the Mossad is for similar events inside Israel, like the kidnapping of three teens the summer before last, which was extremely suspicious, as well as the implausible
                effectiveness of the “Iron Dome” defense, which is likely hyped up beyond its maximum possible effectiveness, by propaganda.

                I lived in Israel, I was born there, and I was visiting in the summer of the attacks, and the media situation in Israel, while slightly better than that in the US (because it’s a much smaller country) is still much worse
                than it was in the 1980s, when the press regularly investigated government malfeasance. Netanyahu’s administration is not above covert activities inside Israel. Israel is probably one of the funding sources for ISIS (as is
                the CIA) to destabilize Syria, ISIS has no support within Syria or Lebanon, and operates entirely on payments and bribery, power, without any actual religious justification or any base of support.

                This is why it is important to explain the drills, and their implausibility, because they don’t require nefarious foreign agents infiltrating the whole government. You certainly won’t find it. All they require is a team of
                programmers for the radar blip drill and simulation (who don’t even have to be in on the plan), and a demolition team. Those could ALL be Israeli agents without the attack being an Israeli operation, because none of these
                people would know why they are doing what they are commanded to do. In the end, you need to blame the drill coordinator, not some evil Jews, because although you find plenty of mighty evil Jews in positions of power in
                Israel today, they aren’t powerful enough in the US to do anything like this.

                You are missing Bayesian inference, see my answer to your next post below. It is important you don’t use your intuition, because this intuition is biased by the blast of propaganda, which gives you a gut feeling that the

                If you want an in-depth description of proper inference for laypeople, there’s Richard Carrier’s most recent books “Proving History” and “On the Historicity of Jesus”, which do a fair job of describing how it works
                (although, just as a plug for physicists’ methods, it is easier to do it using logarithms of probability, which doesn’t require as much tedious multiplications and divisions, and allows you to do it in your head to the rough
                ballpark accuracy which is all that is required in these types of debates).

                Richard Carrier has explained how to weigh evidence like this for a completely different case, in “Proving History” and “On the Historicity of Jesus”, and in Carrier’s case, the evidence is ancient, and has much lower
                quality. The method is Bayesian inference, and the quality of the evidence is the relative factor of confidence that it gives you for either the “coincidence theory” (the drills are coincidental— required on the official
                story) or the “one-man conspiracy theory” (the one that predicts the drills).
            </p>
            <p>
                The “one-man conspiracy theoy” doesn’t just predict that SOME drills are occuring, it is a straightforward inference from this theory that you pretty much need all of the four drills I gave. You need drones, because pilots
                won’t do it, you need a simulation, because even with drones pilots still won’t do it, and you need real airliners and a switch in order to make it work (you also need a practice run for the simulation, which is reported for
                four months before 9/11, and you also need other drills to get satellite imagers out of their office, and to disable fighter response, etc, etc, all of which were occuring, but ignore that, as it only makes my case
                stronger). The only reasonable alternative inside-job scenario is rigging the actual airliners for remote hijacking from the ground, to take over the commercial plane itself and then pilot it into the building without a swap
                with a drone. But that this is not what happened can be established from the engine on Murray St. (which doesn’t match the hijacked Boings, but matches military aircraft), the speed of impact (too high at Sea-level for a
                commercial aircraft, but within tolerance for a military aircraft), witnesses (who attest to windowless uniform-color planes), and photos of the underside of the plane that crashed into the building, which show that the
                underside is that of a drone not a plane. Given these additional bits of data, the hijacked planes were not taken over by remote control, that theory is implausible even within the inside-job sector of theory space, you need
                a swap.
            </p>
            <p>
                But ignore all this secondary stuff, and just examine the drills. The scenario predicts multiple precise drills on that day involving airplane crashes, multiple hijacking, air-traffic control, and terrorism, and the
                frequency of such drills is at best 1 in 100, as it is not even 3 drills a year, these are more once-in-a-lifetime drills. Also, they didn’t need to take place in the morning, they could have been at different times, in the
                afternoon, in the evening.
            </p>
            <p>
                To have 1 drill coinciding is a baysian factor of 1/100 confidence, to have 2 drills coinciding is 1/10,000, and three drills on the same morning is 1/1,000,000. We have rock-solid evidence that the radar-blip drill was
                going on, rock-solid evidence of live-fly exercizes, and rock-solid evidence of simulation of crashes on that day, although the targets are not known to be the Pentagon and WTC with any confidence. There is also some
                indication of a hijacking drill, but this is from incidental testimony, this evidence is not solid like the others, which is not surprising, because all the direct witnesses to this drill died on the flights. The 1 in a
                million is a bit of an overestimate, considering the drills aren’t completely independent events, but it is an underestimate in a different way, in that the drills precise form is predicted also, not just their precise date
                (let alone time) and I haven’t taken any of this into account. The estimate above is more than reasonable, it is charitable, and you could make it better with up to a factor of 10, pushing in my direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                The level of confidence from the coincidence is therefore that the inside job theory is preferred by about a million to 1 as compared to the coincidence theory. Let me make an analogy. If you saw a magician levitating, and
                you found out that three weeks before he purchased a large amount of Niobium-Tin alloy, a dewar-full of liquid Helium, and heat-sheilding and thermostat equipment, and that he brought all of these along to the levitation
                date, you might say “that’s a coincidence, what does that have to do with levitation?”. Once someone points out to you that Niobium Tin is a superconductor at liquid Helium temperature, and that magnets float on a
                superconductor, you are justified in deducing that the magician was using a superconducting material and magnets to levitate, even if you didn’t yet get direct evidence for the purchace of a large quantity of magnets. That’s
                how inference works, it works by Bayesian rules, and the theory that best fits the evidence is the one that is overwhelmingly likely to be correct.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I must caution that by itself, without further evidence, you aren’t 100% confident yet, you need to make sure the story is consistent with ALL the evidence, because there might be some implausible story behind it all.
                For example, Bin Laden knew administration officials, and arranged the drills and exploited them to his own advantage, or nonsense like this, which is implausible, but the coincidence itself is already beyond implausible. In
                the magician analogy, maybe he intended to use superconductors to levitate, but the superconductor didn’t work, and he just ended up using wires in the end, or something like this. You can’t foresee all possibilities. This
                is why, despite the overwhelming confidence of the drills, it is important to review ALL the remaining evidence carefully, to make sure you have accounted for everything (aside from known lies, like the Bin-Laden confession
                video, or the known-to-be-hoaxed phone call to that administration official from his wife on flight 77)

                The ACARS and radar data obtained by Pilots for 9/11 Truth shows the swap of flight 175 and an unidentified plane from the military exercises of that day explicitly. I mentioned the engine, and the underside of the plane,
                and the witness testimony. In conjunction with the drills very occurence, this is enough for scientific certainty, it’s about as good as the current evidence for the Higgs Boson.
            </p>
            <p>I am sorry to tell you, but 9/11 was simply an inside job, without any qualification. There is no reasonable chance that it happened any other way than the exact way I said above.</p>
            <p>
                Now, it is incumbant upon you to explain the psychology of the deniers, and mainstream shills, who write nonsense articles like the above. What I said was said somewhat more verbosely by Webster Tarpley, and the author of
                “Flight of the Bumble Planes”, already in 2002. It just seems nobody paid attention at the time, and that includes me. The real psychology worth studying is why most of us were able to deny this evidence and buy a
                cock-and-bull story for so long. In my defense, I didn’t think about it all that much until the Boston Bombing, but that’s no excuse, I should have.

                Demolition is not quite enough to demonstrate that the attack was an inside job. All that it does is establish a cover-up of the demolition. That the demolition happened is completely obvious, given the physics and
                chemistry, but it is not in itself indicative of anything much. For all you know, all high-profile high-rises are rigged to be demolished in case of terror attack, to prevent them falling over and killing more people in case
                of collapse. That’s a terrible thing to keep secret, but that’s not the same as saying America attacked itself.

                The main problem is to persuasively explain that it WAS an inside job. This is not done using the demolition evidence, it just isn’t strong enough. To establish the inside job, you absolutely need to examine the drills of
                that day. Those confirm that it was done in pretty much the only way that it could be done, at least, the only way that doesn’t involve a massive conspiracy. The method I explain below doesn’t involve any conspiracy at all,
                it can be the plan of one person, the rest all believe they are simply doing their job for a scheduled military exercise, a military drill.
            </p>
            <p>
                The demolition itself is not hard to do in secret— just hire a team to rig the building up in advance. It can be 5-10 people, and you can hire Israelis, or whoever. I only say Israelis because of the report of dancing
                Israelis on 9/11. Maybe they set up the demolition. To cover it up is extremely simple, because you say “The demolition system was necessary for public safety, and we have similar systems on the Sears tower, and we want you
                to keep it secret, because otherwise the Sears tower will become a target”.
            </p>
            <p>As for the rest of the plot, every aspect of 9/11 can be arranged, planned and paid for, from within the government, using four simultaneous drills:</p>
            <p>
                1. Fake Airliner hijacking drill (to get airplanes)<br />
                2. radar blip drill (to confuse air-traffic control)<br />
                3. fly drones over the Eastern US<br />
                4. Flight simulate crashing airplanes into WTC and Pentagon.
            </p>
            <p>
                These drills are individually harmless, nobody doing them would suspect that they have anything to do with terrorism. But then your lone conspirator, who is in charge of these drills just changes things slightly— the
                simulation from drill 4 is attached to the drones of drill 3, and the radar blip drill, drill 2, is used to swap the drones of drill 3 with the airliners of drill 1 to make the flight paths seem continuous. Then the attack
                carries itself out.
            </p>
            <p>
                The complete evidence that the attack is an inside job is that these exact drills were taking place on 9/11, on the morning, inexplicably simultaneous with the attacks. These drills (at least 3 of them) were widely reported
                in the mainstream press, but of course, you wouldn’t consider this information anything more than a crazy coincidence. Once you understand how to pull it off, it becomes overwhelming evidence of an inside job.
            </p>
            <p>
                To arrange the death of crew and passengers on the planes, you have to do a little bit of shifting of boarding at the gate, which can be justified as part of the drill, to get the flight 77 passengers on flight 93, perhaps
                also flight 175 and 11, and you can also land the now untracked airliners, and transfer passengers from flight until they are all on flight 93 (it’s actually flight 11 in terms of the airplane used). Then you shoot flight 93
                down, and this is the other cover up. Both cover-ups are normal government nonsense, one to protect safety, the other to protect the military from civil liability.
            </p>
            <p>
                The statistical coincidence of drills and attack is impossible without it being a false flag, so that’s the end of the story. Regarding the “conspiracy”, there IS NO CONSPIRACY NECESSARY. All of this is done by whoever
                organized the drills, essentially working alone. I’ll let you look up who was in charge of all that morning’s drills yourself, but I assure you it will not come as a surprise— it was a well known balding neoconservative
                figure with a pacemaker. The modern information tools make it possible to do much more effective false flags, if you have the drills you need to pull them off in secret.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no counter-argument to this, there is no other possibility, the attack simply WAS an inside job, no ifs ands or buts. Still, only the demolition and shoot-down of flight 93 were covered up intentionally. The only
                concrete evidence this kind of thing leaves is an attack that coincides spookily with a drill to simulate a VERY SIMILAR attack. That’s all you would see in public, and that’s all you would see if you were investigating.
                Bush was probably clueless about this, the 9/11 commission was clueless, the only thing they covered up intentionally was the demolition, and possibly the shoot-down of flight “93”, if they knew about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                That doesn’t excuse the commission members from culpability, nor does it excuse the Bush administration. The solution to a covert attack in the US is a public review of all secret documents and drills, and an investigation
                of all administration officials, not sheilding people from scrutiny and shredding the official relevant documents, which is what Bush and co did.

                drones of drill 3 with the airliners of drill 1 to make the flight paths seem continuous. Then the attack carries itself out.

                coinciding spookily with drills to simulate such an attack, even to the government and those investigating. Bush was probably clueless about this.

                It is clear the the financial support for the flat Earth movement is coming from the same place as the UFO movement, from people who are conducting a social experiment on bogus ideas on the internet. It is extremely easy to
                disprove bogus ideas online, the flat Earth is refuted by the measurement of “how far can I see from a tower”, the law being that the distance the square root of the product of the height of the tower and the radius of the
                Earth. This law extends from ship mast-towers of 20 meters, where you can see about 10km to airliners at 10 km, where you can see things up to 250 km away. The law is very easy to check today, and it can be done by anyone
                from a local mountain.

                Americans have been by and large very stupid regarding socialism, which makes the public policy debates in the US by and large unlistenable, since ignoring socialism in economics is like ignoring quantum mechanics in
                physics. Socialism first fairly analyzes the concentration of capital in a few hands, and then gives remedies to undo the damage that this causes. Depending on the remedy, it can lead to fantastic policies, or else to a
                Soviet nightmare. Economically, Keynsianism is the child of socialism, it is the British and Obama version, but Keynsianism doesn’t work when banks don’t lend money as today, and it is rather anemic compared to the stronger
                prescriptions that Bernie Sanders offers, which involve breaking up large institutions and creating real competition, along with encouragements to create a real sector of worker owned industry. These proposals have been
                necessary since the 1980s, they really have the potential to modernize the American economy, but nobody before has had the backbone to introduce them.

                What Bernie Sanders is talking about is the horrific media situation in 1988, which was entirely hopeless, it was the darkest of dark ages. Among all the media outlets, only the highly technical scientific literature
                reliably told the truth. Even the abysmal Soviet party-censored press was marginally better than the American press in that period, at least when it was reporting on American and South American issues. This issue disappeared
                for me to a large extend in the early 1990s, as it became obvious that the internet would solve this problem, as it was intrinsically resistant to monopolistic information control in ways that other media is not. This meant
                one could foresee there the left movement in the US would grow in tandem with the shift to online media, and, although it was delayed by a decade due to 9/11, I think the expression is “Feel the Bern”.

                The market is based on a concept of a competitive equilibrium— what that means is that when you charge a price, you are controlled by others who can also charge a price and undercut you. The process of competition ensures
                that everyone’s salary ends up (roughly) equal, at least at full employment, because, to put it bluntly, if someone is making more than you, you start to do what they are doing. It only takes a little bit of surplus people
                to drive the salary to the mean. An example is computer programming, which used to be lucrative, but now makes an average professional salary.
            </p>
            <p>
                This prediction, equal compensation for all, is correct in market theory, but it is abusrd in real life— it’s never even close to what happens in real markets. The prediction breaks down in two ways— the first is
                unemployment. Competition with the unemployed (which don’t exist in a perfect market) leads salaries for certain jobs to plummet. State spending policiy is designed to remove unemployment by monetary policy. This is
                Keynesianism. The other place it breaks down is where people have extra power to leverage an enormous wage. Where you see large incomes, this competitive mechanism has broken down. For example, a CEO can demand a large
                compensation without worrying about a lower bid from a guy who sends his resume in to the company to replace him. Likewise for celebrity actors, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                These enormous compensations have nothing to do with optimal market conditions, and this is what progressive taxation is designed to fix. It’s to make the market look more like a textbook market, even when you know this is a
                hopeless fantasy. The two policies together, government spending to remove unemployment, and progressive taxes to make salaries (roughly) equal, together make the market more efficient, because it looks more like a
                reasonable caricature of the textbook ideal rather than something wildly distorted.

                What is not fair is that you are making more in the first place. Under perfect competition, you wouldn’t be making any more than anyone else. So it is important to confiscate the money of those who make a lot of it,
                otherwise the market breaks down. Sorry bub, those are the rules of economics.

                This is not likely a false flag, because the operatives were killed in a suicide operation, so they needed to be brainwashed young people, not seasoned intelligence agency people. They were likely receiving orders via
                internet, and getting supplies, guns and suicide vests, from couriers, and only needed to meet up on the day of the attack. France seems to have been immune to such false flags in the past. While ISIS is a Western and Saudi
                creation, once it acquired independent sources of financing through looting ancient art and oil production, it seems to have a life of its own, and it can no longer be controlled. This attack is probably what people are
                saying. That is not to say that past events, the ones between 2000 and 2010 are as they seem, those are clearly false flags, as they have reported drills associated to them, in ways that are statistically impossible. I doubt
                very much there were any drills in Paris on Friday.
            </p>
            <p>
                EDIT: It seems I was wrong about drills— there was at least one drill involving medical personnel that leaked. It could be an inside job, but then there is probably exactly one way to do it: have one “hostage taking” drill
                involving three stupid agents who are killed, and have additional agents shoot the theater and the original agents who take the hostages, killing them. The bombs are easy to do with drills too, same as the Boston Bombing.
                One just has to wait to see if any French leaks about drills come out in the next few weeks.

                It’s much simpler— you simply have to ask “what percentage of Musims support ISIS?” That percentage is closer to zero than you can measure in a poll, as you will not find any supporters except people who are literally
                insane, or on ISIS’s payroll. That’s the end of it— you can’t have a popular movement without popular support. ISIS is a creation of whoever is funding it, wealthy billionaires and some governments engaged in realpolitik to
                weaken other parties in the region. When the financial support dries up, the organization dies.

                those getting paid by ISIS, who support ISIS, they all wish they were gone. That makes it a foreign influence, not a local homegrown group, and it is gaining financial strength through criminal and commercial activity, not
                through winning friends and influencing people. Nobody supports ISIS except the people it pays and a handful of billionaires and people buying stolen goods and oil who keep the racket going. In a free election, they wouldn’t
                win even one seat of parliament, unlike the IRA.

                All the terrorist attacks in the West since 1990, with the exception of Basque events in Spain which have a long history, are done by groups whose support and funding is not indigenous and whose motives are insincere. These
                groups are not legitimate popular movements, you haven’t seen that kind of terrorism since the Weathermen, the PLO, the Red Brigades in the 1970s. Unlike these groups, the financing and political support for ISIS is not
                coming from local people in the region, it ALL comes from outside. These groups would not have formed without Westerners funneling money to them initially, like the Contras. They are hired mercenaries, not terrorists
                exactly. In the case of Al-Qaeda in the 1980s, it came from the US through the CIA, to destablize the Soviet supported government in Afghanistan. In the case of the Contras, it came from drug-smuggling to the US, and in the
                case of ISIS, it came from covert efforts to subvert the Syrian government.
            </p>
            <p>
                The attacks in the US in the 1990s, the WTC bombing, the Oklahoma City bombing, are all extremely suspicious, and come with no sensible motive or political purpose. In the case of the Oklahoma City bombing, the attack
                coincided with an ATF drill for bombs in the same building, make of that what you will. The attack in Africa, the other things are too poorly reported to make any picture of.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no Muslim terrorist agenda, there is no goal, there is no cause, there is no support. The only purpose of terrorism is to subvert Western governments, to make them more powerful and more imperialistic, and to make
                them spend more money on “anti-terrorism”, which paradoxically goes to finance terrorist organizations through paying infiltrators and moles. The cycle of governments self-financing their own threats is similar to the
                situation depicted by Terry Gilliam in the 1985 movie Brazil.

                wealthy donors, from commercial and criminal activity, and from state-level spending funnelled to these organizations under pretext of infiltration and spying. If you take a poll in Syria, in Iraq, wherever, there is zero
                support— the Arab governments universally denounce these organizations, as does every citizen you will ever encounter in real life. It is not reasonable to treat such terrorism as if it were an ongoing intractable clash of
                large scale social forces when it is a problem produced by an extremely small group of people supporting organized crime with donations and paychecks. Any such criminal organizations can be easily dismantled by directly
                attacking the funding sources. Nobody in the countries affected would miss them, except those fighters getting paid.

            <p>
                The fact that terrorist organizations exist means that someone likes them. From polling Muslims, you can see it’s not any Arabs or Muslims. But having crazy people with guns around allows a foreigner only donating money to
                destabilize whatever government it doesn’t like, without consequences, governments in France and governments in Syria. There is no benefit to ISIS from attacks in France, or from anything else that they do, there is only
                benefit to those who would like a militarized and surveilled West, and a Middle East in chaos. All the Republican candidates wholeheartedly support the war on terror, and point fingers at Muslims. Among the Democratic
                candidates, it’s just Clinton. She seems to be happy to live in the new world of artificial terrorism that the Bush administration invented. You can’t expect such nonsense to end if you elect those who willingly join in the
                charade, even if their contribution was the fantasy role-play involved in killing Bin Laden rather than real murder.

                Right. In about 20% of the controvertial cases, the vast majority of relevant experts are full of crap. This is why it is important to do a review, and online it is marginally possible. A second example of a whole world of

                Orwell died before English socialism was fully formed. He was opposed to the British system of Free Markets regulated by equally applied rule of law, because it was the architect of the British class system, and the
                systematic empoverishment of the working class, and various atrocities, from the Irish famine, to Colonial subjugation, and the internment camps of the Boer war.

                The point Orwell was making with his pigs was that the Soviet Communists were indistinguishable from the Capitalist oppressors, they were only different in the words they abused to justify the oppression. An oppressor class
                is an oppressor class no matter what the label. Orwell hated Capitalism for the same reason he hated Communism, he didn’t like the idea of a small group of people controlling the economy and telling everyone else what to do.
                He fought for the anarchist POUM in the Spanish Civil War. There is nothing wrong with equating the pigs to the capitalists, because they become indistinguishable from the humans by the end.

                The internet was not created by capitalism. It was created in universities, at CERN, and other solely government sponsored projects, and all it’s software was designed by free software people. Capitalism has been an
                impediment to its development, as the enforcement of copyright has prevented file sharing, idiotic patents hampered free software development, and corporate bodies wrote crappy inferior software. The only time that
                capitalism helped spread internet was in the 1990s, when the ISPs and companies were small. Once they were monopolized, they became stupid and useless.

                I do not follow any existing religion, I am telling you that it is NOT crazy, because there is a real idea behind it that you can’t see. An abstract idea, a very difficult idea, but a REAL idea, like pi, and if you don’t get
                it, you can’t criticize it properly. Your arguments sound like “How can pi exist, when every circle has a different circumference?” You just don’t understand the concept of God.

                (you need to scroll down, but there are interesting discussions there). The point of the monotheistic Jewish God (and also other versions of the monotheistic God) is as an abstraction of absolute perfect morality. All of
                these ideas are fundamentally equivalent as ideas, like different infinite series which converge to pi, although they come with completely different stories and traditions (like different series have different terms). The
                concept is sensible, and needs to be internalized, and it is not crazy, despite your superficial impression, and despite the craziness of the ancient stories that illustrate the concept.

                Pi also only exists in the human imagination as an abstract idea, but it is still undeniably true that the sum of the reciprocal odd numbers in order with alternating signs converges to pi/4. The fact that something is
                abstract doesn’t make it less “real” or less important. I am trying to explain the important idea behind the concept of God, perhaps ineptly. That’s the reason I wrote a lot.

                I am not trying to start a cult following. I possibly could if I tried really hard, I have a vague inkling of an idea of how to go about it, but it’s a stupid thing to do. I prefer to think about science most of the time,
                not religion. Anyway, it would be extraordinarily time consuming and dangerous, I mean, look what happened to L. Ron Hubbard. Also, I don’t think that 2015 is the time for starting cults and religions, it is the time to end

                That was a joke, silly. I got it from a rather vivid hallucination of the risen Jesus, like Paul. The hallucination came after reading Sade’s “The 120 Days of Sodom” cover to cover, and I recommend that book for the
                experience. That’s more or less the truth, although of course, I wouldn’t have taken this hallucination seriously if it didn’t come with a stone-cold rational solid ethical argument.

                Past authority and sounding-good-to-you are not the only two options for validating ideas. Otherwise new ideas would never come, especially the new ideas that don’t sound good to anyone. I would recommend learning
                mathematics to see how to properly validate ideas. The paragraphs you seek a citation for constitute a definition of the otherwise undefined word “God”, which everyone seems to have a different opinion about.
            </p>
            <p>
                The definition I gave for God might be surprising to you, because it isn’t what you usually hear, but this definition is not usually surprising to religious people in general, at least those that aren’t children. As Pope
                Francis recently said “God is not a magician with a magic wand”. God feeds the hungry not by magic, but by motivating people to feed the hungry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Religious people don’t usually sit around and wait for miracles, most religious people are not fundamentalists, and do not need to believe in literal miracles. God is what I said above, no magic, no miracles, just absolute
                ethics. I know, because God came down from heaven and told me. I don’t need to do anything more than assert, because it’s a definition. It’s a good definition, because once you understand it, religious people stop sounding
                crazy and start sounding sensible
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason it is confusing is because fundamentalists conflate it with something else, something impossible— a world creating magic person. That’s just a gimmick for children. Whoever seriously believes that crap is mentally
                ill. Unfortunately, most religious people hardly ever say what I just said point blank, because they don’t want to offend fundamentalists. I don’t care about offending fundamentalists, you need to understand that religious
                people are not talking about anything supernatural (at least in those cases where they are making sense).

                God isn’t a magic person in the sky, it lives in a different place than we do. That’s the Platonic idealized realm of pure mathematics, the world of abstract computer programs, the same place that the number “pi” lives, and
                the idealized perfect geometrical circle. It’s a very abstract idea, an idealization of perfect absolute morality. It is based on the concept of superrationality, and it can be idealized as having perfect knowledge about
                every one of us, because it is a Platonic idealization, and it can be idealized as having desires about our personal behaviors, because a consistent moral calculus attributes a utility to all actions. A Platonic idea like
                this just can’t do supernatural magic, but it can alter people’s minds and actions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only impact God can have on the world is through people’s ideas changing and converging, and people acting in concert to make change, as they did during the Christian revolution in the 1st-6th centuries. This change was
                so profound, that it had the effect of God inserting himself into history as a fake historical person. It is physically impossible for any spiritual God to insert himself into history literally.

                A mythical Jesus is not a conspiracy, it is a description of the growth of a religion with a crucified mythical messiah figure at the start. The mythicist position of Carrier is extraordinarily Jewish in character, as the
                mythical Jesus is derived from Isiah 53, from mesianic literature, and from the rituals of the temple. I would suggest you read Carrier’s book instead of repeating ignorant statements about mythicists.

            <p>Carrier’s is an egotistical narcissist. So what. He’s right about Jesus.</p>
            <p>
                His ego is a function of working hard in relative isolation on something counterintuitive and important. If he didn’t have an ego, he wouldn’t be out there challenging conventions. Progress depends on the unreasonable man.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nobody is more well studied or better informed than Carrier, because Carrier is the only one that actually gets a part of the profound depth of Christian theology. He understands Isiah 53 is a prophecy of messiah, that it
                predates the Gospel and inspires it, in that the messiah is prophesied to suffer and die in Jewish sources, so that the death of the Messiah is not embarassing to all Jews. He understands the role that Jesus’s blood
                sacrifice plays in removing the temple from Jewish life, and he has a tremendous grasp of both the original sources and the modern scholarly literature, which he has actually read thoroughly and independently. This is more
                than can be said for his critics, who think that the Christian theology is an ad-hoc imposition constrained to fit to historical events. Historical events are never so convenient to fit a pre-existing theology so well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Carrier understands the main point— that it is not the incidental portions of the gospel story that are used to justify Christian religion, it is the main arc. Nothing about the story is incidental or accidental, nothing is
                embarrassing, all of it is essential, every last little bit. This makes it more likely myth, not history.
            </p>
            <p>
                His conclusions are not at all the opposite of Christian scholars. He AGREES with the fundamentalist Christians about Isiah 53 (and he is right, unlike later Jewish commentators— he argues correctly using the 1st century
                Targum that the chapter refers to the Messiah), he AGREES with fundamentalist Christians that Christ is seen as a manifestation of God right from the beginning (other secular scholars have to make Jesus a man first, God
                later). Unlike other secular scholars, he takes seriously how WELL Jesus fulfils prophesy, including ALL the old testament sources and parallels to the NT sources, and his analysis is meticulous.
            </p>
            <p>
                He also understands what “most parsimonious hypothesis” means. When Paul says “according to scriptures”, the most parsimonious hypothesis is not “according to gospels”, because these are not yet written. The proper
                interpretation is “according to OT scripture”. Carrier shows you the proper scriptural basis for this claim, and also the claim of revelation. Your arguments are refuted in his book, without any use of Bayesian method,
                simply because you have no idea what you are talking about and he explains this clearly in simple English, no math.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding the Bayesian method, he does it reasonably well, with a few caveats I list below. Baysianism is simply a quantitative version of the heurisitic weighing of evidence that one does in a courtroom or history lesson,
                and the only purpose he uses it for is to make the underlying arguments clear. He does not give false precision regarding his numbers, his ranges are all over the place. But in all, he is relatively fair to the opposition,
                by giving very small Bayesian weights to either side. If you wish to argue the other case, you had better say what pieces of evidence, or what confluence of evidence, you attach strong Bayesian weight for historicity using.
                Good luck, because there isn’t any.
            </p>
            <p>If you demand that I quibble on the use of Bayesianism, I do have some quibbles. Although these quibbles are incidental, and don’t change his conclusions very much.</p>
            <p>
                I personally prefer to use log-factors to do Baysianism, as is standard in physics. These log-factors were introduced by Turing in WWII (probably others too, it’s like free energy in physics). The log-factor is how much
                better each evidence fits a given hypothesis as compared to the others, and only the difference in log-factor matters. Then you determine how much more likely hypothesis A is compared to hypothesis B by adding the log
                factors together for the hypotheses, and the exponential of this tells you the confidence. It’s a simpler methodology than using multiplicative factors, as Carrier does.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are two problems with Bayesian analysis. The first is dishonest people— Bayesianism is a tool that can be used to derive false confidence from 10 pieces of evidence each with probability 1/2. You can conclude that the
                10 pieces together give a 1 in 1024 chance of a hypothesis being wrong, when you are missing that they are not independent, and a proper alternative hypothesis can explain all 10 pieces from just one all-encompasing idea. An
                example would be if you found DNA at a crime scene, and matched it to a suspect with 99.9999% confidence using 20 alleles, but ignored that the suspect has an identical twin, who would also match all these alleles. In the
                case of DNA, one has easy ways to understand correlations in populations, it is much harder to know the correlations between evidence in history, because it depends on the dating and dependence of the sources. Carrier
                sidesteps this by telling you his assumptions on dating and dependence, and his probabilities are always global, they come at the end of the chapter, by putting together the historical discussion. He doesn’t use
                micro-probability false-accurate numbers to drive the conclusion, as dishonest Bayesians do. I have to commend him here.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other problem is simply that there are too many alternative hypotheses to consider, including ones that you just never thought of. This means it requires a long back and forth to make sure your conclusions are
                reasonable, letting other people propose explanations for the discrepancies which might make the implausibility go away, and not to take the numbers in intermediate stages too seriously. The probability can fluctuate wildly
                between what looks like “superficially impossible” and “superficially certain”, back and forth, all based on small changes in how you weigh the evidence in light of new explanations. It is this property that makes different
                experts reach different conclusions regarding historicity, the evidence, with slightly different Baysian weights, will lead to completely different firm opinions that superficially seem to be solidly based on the evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cure for this is humility, which Carrier displays in just the proper amount sufficient fo honest academic work. The Baysian factors need to be honestly estimated, as they tell you the summary of a person’s judgement and
                experience. Carrier is putting his judgement on the line, by publishing his Baysian factors, which lets you see EXACTLY how he is thinking. This makes it easy to criticize him, because he is transparent, while his
                non-numerical colleagues are opaque. But this is his virtue, and their vice.
            </p>
            <p>
                My only nitpick with his conclusion is that he doesn’t consider the “incidental Jesus” idea, the idea that Jesus incarnated on Earth anonymously, and got crucified anonymously. This needs to be added to the “minimal
                mythicist” hypothesis of a celestial crucifiction in order to produce the “most minimal mythicist” hypothesis. His rejection of this idea is facile in chapter 4, he says that if Jesus was on Earth, but as an unimportant
                person, he would expect Peter to want to know more about him, or to say something about this. I don’t think this conclusion is firm, because he has not considered the idea that Peter’s Jesus was a specific but anonymous
                “everyman”, like the contemporary “homeless Jesus” sculpture depicts. This is partially consistent with Paul’s description of Jesus incarnating as a slave, but it is not consistent with certain references to a heavenly
                crucifiction. I would put the odds on celestial crucifiction vs. anonymous crucifiction as only 2:1 or 3:1, meaning that Carrier’s version of a crucifiction and resurrection in the celestial sphere is not supported by as
                strong evidence as the rest of his case (but it is supported).
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding your ridiculous idea that Christians would admit something under torture, you are presuming that there would be some underhanded secret to admit! That presumes that historicity is what the early Christians
                believed, right from the start. It is preposterous to assume that historicity is the only thing that could inspire Christians to resist Roman barbarity, it is INSULTING to religious faith. No faith ever comes from history,
                it comes from the mind. The Jews who fought Rome in the three Jewish wars were not going by historical example to resist, and they were tortured and murdered far worse. Just because your faith is too weak to suffer and die
                for a pure idea with no historical basis, don’t presume that all others are similarly cravenly.

                A logical positivist cannot be converted by infantile stories of obviously impossible material events, but still, an atheist can follow the teachings of a mythical Jesus more assiduously than the typical theist follows what
                they believe is the historical one.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I would suggest to the Christian, if they wish to save the atheist’s soul, to explain why the myth is worth emulating, rather than arguing that it is historically valid, which can’t possibly work to convert atheists,

            <p>Carrier is a meticulous researcher, the best in the field by far, and is the only one who understands Christian theology as deeply as actual Christian theologians.</p>
            <p>
                But I am not Carrier and I did not make the claim that Jesus was a “Pure spirit being” (neither does Carrier). Jesus was incarnated in a body, but whether that body was in the heavens or on Earth, which I think is debatable,
                nobody claims to know him. Jesus was in an anonymous slave’s body, an insignificant body, except for getting crucified, and the historical Jesus, whether he was in the celestial sphere or on Earth, was simply not considered
                important by either Peter or Paul. Carrier is persuaded that the events happened in the celestial sphere, but this is not necessary, as they could have been imagined on Earth too, or in both places synchronously, or it might
                have been left vague.
            </p>
            <p>
                I read the entirety of the New Testament documents long before reading Carrier, and I don’t read atheist blogs, nor do I consider myself an atheist exactly. I don’t believe in the HISTORICAL Jesus, I believe that the RISEN
                JESUS is the sole cause of Christianity. The risen Jesus doesn’t need a historical body, He is powerful enough to manufacture a body for himself by getting his followers to modify the historical record, which is exactly what
                He seems to have done. Only honest Christians and theologians, and Richard Carrier, ascribe to the risen Jeuss enough power to write his own story into history without any material events to inspire them. I assure you that
                the spiritual Jesus can easily do that, and to deny that it can be done, to require a historical material source, is to deny the spiritual power of Jesus to transcend material circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you think a real teacher had to be there to inspire the story and tradition, your faith in the power of Jesus is extraordinarily empoverished. Do you REALLY think the risen Jesus, the same risen Jesus that defeated the
                power of Rome and converted a billion people, couldn’t get four people to write and synchronize fictional biographies of him in 80 AD and get them accepted as history? That is a lack of faith.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is hard to argue that Paul and Peter thought of Jesus as anything more than an anonymously incarnated divinity who got crucified to save our sins. Peter didn’t know Jesus personally, or if he thought he did, he didn’t
                know that THIS particular person, rather than that, was Jesus. He didn’t have a particular historical person in mind, he possibly left it open, or he might have been adamant that Jesus was in the celestial realm. I don’t
                know, and I don’t care, because it doesn’t matter. In either case, Jesus is not historical. Carrier makes a stronger claim, that we can know that the incarnation and crucifiction were initially purely celestial events, and
                he might be right, but the strength of the evidence for this is less than the evidence against historicity. Mythicism does not ride on the celestial interpretation.
            </p>
            <p>Nobody knows who Jesus is, and that’s the way it always was, and the way it should be. The “homeless Jesus” sculpture is more appropriate than any other depiction to the view of the original founders.</p>

                Of course nothing can convince me, and nothing should convince YOU either, because it’s a mentally retarded story for children. Paul is talking about a revealed resurrection. I have nothing further to say to you, except that
                if you believe that Jesus walked around as a zombie, you need to seek medical help, because you are mentally ill.

        <div>
            <p>
                I don’t understand— there is absolutely nothing that can convince me that the events of the resurrection are historically true material events. I would not believe such a preposterous story even if I saw it with my own eyes.
                No event in my mind can possibly change this, as events in the mind simply do not constitute the class of evidence that I accept for changing the beliefs I hold regarding material world. For that, I require instrument
                readings, quantum mechanics, mathematical laws, S-matrices, that kind of stuff, stuff that is generally irrelevant to ethics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Likewise, there is absolutely nothing that can lead me to deny that the events of the resurrection are spiritually true insights, as for this class of events, revelation is sufficient evidence, if it can be supplemented with
                reason and made consistent with ethical teachings that are universal, as I have become sure that this insight is. In this regard, I personally confidently attest to the truth of at least the most central parts of the
                Christian doctrine. I also try to explain it in a more atheistic-friendly way, as I can do that, having been an atheist before and during my “conversion”. This is not to deny the truth of other religious doctrines, mind you,
                just to attest that I am pretty sure I personally get it regarding Christianity, and I can explain the doctrine to atheists. I don’t know why you are taking my word for this, because, although I am not lying, I can’t prove
                it to anyone else very well. I did explain it to other atheists at great length, and I think I was able to get some of them to “see the light”, so to speak. I don’t think you would like the discussion, as it is focused on
                ambiguities in game theory, large computable ordinals, and teleology in evolutionary dynamics of complex systems, with the revelation being an exegesis of these rather abstract objects and ideas, and their direct relevance
                to undermining any unethical power-structures in society.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think it is absurd to think that a spiritual event had to occur in a scientifically impossible way in the material world in order for it to be true. God is not something revealed in miracles in the material world, God is
                revealed in miracles of the mind. No spiritual event can possibly force a person to renounce rational scientific thought, because any true insights can’t possibly be incompatible with precise logical thinking about nature.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I got the religious business, as an atheist, I actually got a little angry, because I felt that the doctrine of faith in existing presentations make it needlessly difficult for scientifically minded people. If you
                insist that a convert must renounce their rationally developed model of evidence about the material world, they are just never going to listen to you, no matter what. I personally never listened to Christians at all, I
                really thought they were crazy for denying scientific laws are universal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Supposing the only two choices available were “deny all Christian spiritual teaching” or “deny material truth of scientific insights”, I would be torn. I don’t know which to defend harder, as both are essential insights.
                It’s really dependent on circumstances. If I were living in Ancient Rome, I would deny science first, because it seems that the corruption of the material order by the monstrously evil power-structure in that horrific empire
                would require ethical insights be placed first. Perhaps our modern power structure is similarly evil enough. But if I were llving in reneissance Europe, I would insist on the scientific view first, because that is what was
                required at that time, to advance the study of the material world. But TODAY, I don’t see any reason to deny one or the other when you can have both.

                I agree that a historical interpretation leads to a different, less spiritual and more literal, view of God, but what can you do about it? It happens gradually, it’s not a purposeful conspiracy, and it’s not exactly a
                deliberate lie, both because everyone believes their own stories, and also because eventually the believer in the community realizes what communion is all about, and what the body of Christ is in the congregation, and the
                two beliefs, the literal resurrection and the spiritual resurrection coexist side by side, as they coexist today.
            </p>
            <p>Whether you can see it or not is not really important, the important question is what happened historically. Historically, this is with high likelihood more or less what happened, as Carrier argues well.</p>
            <p>
                Christians can’t have been tempted to remove the cross, as the cross is central event: it’s the sacrifice that ends blood sacrifice. It is what sets Christianity apart from both Judaism and the barbaric Roman order. How do
                you get more converts by denying the main event? You are not gaining converts by denying the cross, you are converting your religion to something which is the opposite.

        <div>
            <p>So your claim is that you can be 95% confident that Nazorean is derived from a place name, without any assumptions, just based on the word? This is a disingenuous position.</p>
            <p>
                I was assuming you were sincere, not making rhetoric. When you do Baysian stuff, you need to stay honest with yourself and with others, not say “Oh, look how easy it would be to make up nonsense and reach nonsense
                conclusions”. Yes, that’s true. That’s why you need to do it honestly, and not take the probability estimates coming out as objective or too definitive, unless they are overwhelming (like 5 sigma or something).
            </p>
            <p>
                I wouldn’t know how you would reach a conclusion of 95% confidence on Nazoreans by any method that does not presume historicity, so I just assumed that’s how you got it. Now I realize you were just playing devil’s advocate,
                and you really don’t attach that confidence to the conclusion. I have to tell you, please stop doing that. I KNOW and everyone knows, that Baysian estimates aren’t immune to devil’s advocacy unless the evidence is extremely
                strong, you can get different conclusions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding the “higher order effects”, these are the nebulous coming together of disparate pieces of evidence to produce more confidence than any one piece individually. Unfortunately, in the case of Jesus, this simply does
                not happen. If you are honest with the coming together of evidence, it is the exact same coming together that is expected on mythicism, it is no more unexpected in mythicism, and it is not evidence. The additional
                synchronicity of evidence only seems to happen when you have some ignorance about the background, when your background makes the myth sources for the stories not understood, for example, when you think that the crucifiction
                is embarrassing, or when you think that the ministry is important, or when you presume a historical interpretation to Nazorean and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wasn’t trying to snow you with the MOND example, just give an example of how you can reach false conclusions with probability. I will point out that we both agree that it’s not 95% likely that the Nazorean refers to
                Nazareth (without assuming historicity), so we reached agreement on this datum with a little back and forth. This is what Carrier advocates Baysian methods for. Sorry for misspelling everything, I have no dictionary in the
                asylum, and Wanda-June keeps misinterpreting my poo-stain writing.

            <p>
                2. That’s not my argument. It doesn’t matter if you convert to a log or not. The mistake is that in order to get 95% you are a-priori assuming historicity, and asking “What does Nazorean mean under historicity”. You conclude
                it is a reference to Nazareth with 95% confidence. Then after you get the 95% confidence, you are circularly using this confidence to argue backward for historicity, what is the probability that the same place name would be
                used in all the Gospels and the Epistles to refer to Christians, and you get confidence for historicity. Then you are even more confident of the place-name identification, and so on and so on. The reinforcing loop allows you
                to conclude your 95% confidence is correct, and also historicity is correct. This is how false judgements are propagated in history. It is not the proper procedure to evaluate evidence. This is the confirmation bias fallacy—
                your hypothesis has confirmed itself through it’s own conclusions circularly, in a self-consistent loop. That doesn’t mean it’s wrong necessarily, just that your confirmation bias intuition leads you to overestimate it’s
                likelihood.
            </p>
            <p>
                To show you the fallacy, let me argue that “There is no dark matter”. First, assume that there is no dark matter, then I need to explain rotation curves of galaxies. This leads me to MOND theory, so that I get a new
                accelaration for a given tiny force. Now assuming MOND, I reproduce the galaxy curves, so I get high confidence in the precise MOND parameters. Now I look at the rotation curves and ask “What is the probability that I would
                reproduce the exact curves from MOND?” It’s a-priori very small, but I reproduce the curves exactly! But I fit the MOND parameters from these very curves, so this is confirmation bias, it isn’t evidence. I would get the same
                results from standard General Relativity and dark matter, and this involves no ad-hoc MOND assumptions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Likewise, for your “place-name” identification, you assumed historicity. Now suppose you assume non-historicity, that means, you need to make yourself mentally sure that Jesus was a myth (temporarily), and ask yourself “What
                is the probability that Nazorean derives from Nazareth now?” You know that this is a myth, you know that Mark wrote the Gospel as fiction. So he made up the town from something pre-existing. You know that Matthew Luke and
                John are responses to Mark (and to each other), and you ask “What is the probability that they would produce the same place-name?” The probability is now very close to 100%. Under this assumption, you know “Nazareth” is
                either made up or comes from “Nazorean”, and you simply don’t know where “Nazorean” comes from. Now you look linguistically at the match of “Nazorean” and “Nazareth”, and you are only 50% confident that it’s a place name,
                perhaps even less.
            </p>
            <p>
                So when you say “I’m 95% sure that Nazorean refers to Nazareth”, you have simply argued circularly. You need to make sure that you use this fact once and only once, and that you consider the mythicist point of view
                thoroughly. As evidence, it is weak soup.
            </p>
            <p>3. I have NOT missed the point, I am telling you that the distinction between the two philosophies you read in the literature is ridiculously overblown, due to the history of work on probability.</p>
            <p>
                The Baysian method was criticized in the 19th century (unfairly), so a new philosophy was set up which gave a different, more objective seeming, basis to probability than what Bayes and Laplace gave. The philosophy was used
                to argue for objective tests to replace the subjective Baysian tests. The name for the philosophy behind these tests was “frequentist”.
            </p>
            <p>
                In point of fact, you can justify all these tests on Baysian terms, and conversely you can justify Baysian reasoning on frequentist terms, they are just not incompatible philosophies. They were only made to seem so because
                of philosophical debate in an academic field. So criticizing people’s philosophy is not the right thing to do, you should post your own Baysian estimators for the conclusions you reach, as Carrier advocates, and stop
                nitpicking his philosophy, which is just weird, not wrong.
            </p>

            <p>
                1. Yes, I include myself in “lots of training”, but my training wasn’t through school. I’m not an experimentalist. I “rediscovered” the Baysian stuff in grad school for myself (nobody taught me, I mean), and I reviewed some
                experimental papers much later, to make sure I wasn’t crazy, after I realized this probability stuff was called “Baysianism”, so I got the hang of it pretty quickly, on my own, without any authority telling me anything.
                Rediscovery is the normal way to know something deeply. I used the method about 10 years ago to argue about another controversial case where all experts agree (in my opinion, completely wrongly), which is the case of
                Shakespeare and Marlowe, whether Marlowe was alive and wrote the plays attributed to Shakespeare.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the case of Marlowe/Shakespeare, unlike Jesus and history, I had to give a 100/1 prior AGAINST this hypothesis (at least) coming in, because Marlowe faking his death starts out so WEIRD as a hypothesis. But then the
                stylometric evidence (comparing style markers in Marlowe Shakespeare) is so statistically strong, so quantitative and so easy to make precise, that it overcomes this prior very easily, and immediately pushes you to 100/1
                for, and better, as more stylistic points of agreement come in and they all match precisely. The publication of “The Shakespeare Guide to Italy” close the case for me, as it made the discrepancies in the historical record
                for the Marlovian idea disappear. This is where I realized the power of Baysianism, it really resolved this question in the a-priori surprising direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. The 2/3 is not a frequentist calculation, or a calculation of ANY SORT. It is simply describing how good I consider this evidence SUBJECTIVELY in my head. it is asking the question “What confidence does my subjective
                probability get from seeing agreement of Nazareth from the four Gospels”.
            </p>
            <p>
                This 2/3 factor is what Carrier calls the a-fortiori estimate, meaning, I’m bending over backwards to make this evidence into as big a deal as possible. It isn’t really what my personal estimate is, my true factor is
                actually between 5/6 and 10/11, meaning hardly anything at all. I prefer to say it in “log” terms, so that it’s additive and not multiplicative. The “free energy” of this evidence (log P) is .1, give or take, and a-fortiori
                at most 1. The “free energy” of the remaining evidence in the Gospels from agreement is of the same order, with fluctuating signs, so in the end, the sum is a wash, it is basically 0, give or take order 1, so nothing at all.
                To say something with confidence you need at least 3 or 4 free energy.
            </p>
            <p>
                One must not try to justify these calculations too much, because they are not calculations in a traditional sense, as too many factors enter into it. They are quantifications of judgement, they tell you how I am thinking.
                But the nice thing about the numbers is that they also tell me how YOU are thinking, and it allows me to correct your mistakes, so that the discussion isn’t stuck.
            </p>
            <p>For example, your statement that you are 95% sure it is a geographic term is manifestly INCORRECT, not just an opinion, and I will show the power of Baysian evidence by arguing it, now that I get your opinion.</p>
            <p>
                Remember that in this assessment of how likely the Nazorean is to be geographical, you aren’t allowed to assume historicity, you must compare the two hypotheses within historicity and a-historicity. Assuming historicity, I
                AGREE WITH YOU, it is true that the Nazorean is around 80-90% likely to be a place marker. But we are trying to find evidence for historicity, so you need to compare the “fit” of Nazorean to a place under historicity with
                the “fit” of Nazorean to something else OR to a place under mythicism (both are possible), and in the end take the ratio of how good the “fit” of this is for the two cases (or the difference in free energy) to say how good
                this evidence is. Under no circumstances is this 2 free energy units, it isn’t even 1, it is about .1-.2. That’s a judgement call.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason this is better than saying “I guess” is that you can CRITICISE THE GUESS, much as I did before, and you can see how the DIFFERENT PIECES OF EVIDENCE FIT TOGETHER TO REACH A CONCLUSION without having to guess at
                the precise method of judgement of the author. You also can incorporate precise evidence (like stylometry) into history, and use the precise evidence with its proper power. The stylometric evidence of Shakespeare and Marlowe
                matching has wrongly not been considered strong historical evidence by historians.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your use of Baysianism is in precise large data sets, and is not likely to be very good for this. So your experience is really useless. You need to think of everything you do as baysianism, and live your life as if every
                decision is a baysian decision. When you start to do this, you quickly learn to translate your subjective judgements into Baysian factors (or free energy factors) and communicate these judgements precisely. Not to give them
                a veneer of objectivity, simply to make your subjective judgement clearly communicable, and easily understandable.
            </p>
            <p>3. PHILOSOPHY:</p>
            <p>
                The philosophy of probability is a thorny issue. I am a LOGICAL POSITIVIST (physicist), and I don’t consider the philosophical question valid. The interpretation of probability is not a meaningful question really, as it is
                not approachable by the senses. But if you force me to answer whether I am a frequentist, I would say I am a Baysian, not a frequentist.
            </p>
            <p>
                But there is still a frequency interpretation of probability, which is the convergence of frequency in many trials, which is just true, it is independent of philosophy. This is what Carrier is using, and because he is
                enamored with the numbers, he tries to justify everything by hypotheticals with many trials.
            </p>
            <p>
                This isn’t WRONG, it just is OVERLY objective-seeming, meaning it makes the act of judgement involved less overtly obvious. I consider this slightly dishonest, so I don’t do it, I just state the bald probabilities. But
                Carrier has to pass peer review, and he has to justify himself more, and this kind of thing is simply not significant. It is not incorrect, just slightly makes the numbers seem more iron-clad than they are.
            </p>
            <p>
                I should point out that if Carrier is trying to pull the wool over people’s eyes, then he is really doing a crappy job, because nobody is getting fooled. He really is trying to methodologically answer a question of “how do
                you find out when expert opinion is being clouded by authority, rather than by neutral best-evaluation of existing evidence?” Making the experts put their priors and probabilities on the table allows you to see how the
                conclusion is achieved, and removes the ability to obfuscate by authority.
            </p>
            <p>
                I advocate, with Carrier, the use of Baysian analysis to explain subjective judgements, because this is what Baysianism is good at doing. This allows different people to understand each other, and to correct each other, and
                for the judgements to converge, because it really is the correct calculus of subjective judgement, much as first order logic is the correct calculus of mathematical inference.

                night to my devoted but brainwashed lover, who gives me her own rolls containing your response, also written in poo. I don’t know why she does that, as she has access to pens.

                (deleted text: “It takes a heck of a lot of training for scientists to do it right” In what did you do your post-doctorate? The fact that you assign a 2/3 ‘Bayesian’ probability to determining two words are linguistic
                cognates, in the same post as giving me a lecture<br />
                on what 5-sigma events mean in Physics is a very good indication that you’ve no clue what such a result entails.)

            <p>Answers:1. no postdoc, asylum.</p>
            <p>
                2. Let me explain this— it’s NOT 2/3 probability of the cognates, the probability is probably 20% at most. What I meant by a 2/3 Baysian factor is that knowing that all the gospels reference the same hometown for Jesus is
                a-priori not required in mythicism, and is a required prediction in historicity. So it provides a Baysian factor against mythicism and for historicity, which is determined by asking “what is the probability of getting the
                same hometown in 4 myth sources”.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the sources were entirely independent, the probability would be effectively zero. But they are not independent of each other, and not independent of shared tradition. So the lack of disagreement about the hometown is
                simply not that unexpected under mythicism either. It’s like asking “what’s the probability that a new Sherlock Holmes story would place him at 229 Baker St.” (or wherever). The new series placed him there, and so did the
                old Arthur Conan Doyle stories. But that’s not because of a historical Sherlock. On the other hand, I could see a dispute arising where one gospel would present one hometown and another gospel would present another. That
                means that the probability of hometown agreement is &lt; 100% under mythicism, and this counts as evidence for historicity. You then can look at other things, like inconsistent geneologies as evidence going the other way.
                There is really very little you can say from this, as geneologies would be likely made up even under historicity. But, on the other hand, the disagreement between gospels on who was in charge during Jesus birthyear (6AD vs
                4BC) is troubling, and cancels out the 2/3 as this goes the other way. Similarly the disagreements on the death date, and other details. Carrier gives it as a wash, meaning both historicity and mythicism are equally likely
                from the Gospels alone, only considering their agreement and disagreement, and I completely agree. But Carrier then gets a 1/3 anti-historicity prior, which people don't like very much. This is based on the gross character
                of the Gospels. In particular, the fact that they add a virgin birth, a confrontation with Satan, a lost childhood, attempts to kill him, etc etc, the Raglan criteria. The statement he is making is that when you have a
                historical figure, and you try to add mythological criteria, you stub your toe--- even in cases where figures are mythologized, most of the time you can't get away with mythologizing them to such a great extent. He scores
                Mark as 15 on the Rank Raglan scale (I score it 14), and considers this 2/3 likely from myth, rather than historicity. That's actually not a bad estimate as I see it, it's not overwhelming, but it is biased to myth. It's
                about the same confidence as you get from the agreement of "Nazareth" in all four gospels. I agree with his judgement there too. It is hard to mythologize a historical person to this great an extent, and finding that it
                happened should start you off at this position. But it really doesn't matter, because all these things are so close to 50/50 that they would be overwhelmed if there was an accumulation of real evidence. Remember that 5 1/4
                pieces of evidence is 1/4^5, which is 1 in a thousand Baysian confidence. So real evidence overwhelms speculation and bad priors, always. It's just that in this case, there really isn't any really good evidence for
                historicity at all. The match on Nazareth in all the sources in all is extremely weak evidence, because it is at least 2/3 likely to my mind that the gospels would agree on this fact even without historical input, simply by
                following a tradition that started either with Mark, or with the Nazoreans (for all I know the first communal settlement of independent socialistic Christians living as brothers was the establishment of Nazareth, that sort
                of thing). I really think it's 4/5 likely, perhaps even 10/11 likely, meaning that this evidence is not a significant factor. It's very difficult to assign the confidences, but the point of these numbers is only that you
                can't hang your conclusion on this fact in isolation. I don't agree with Carrier that the probability of truth of a hypothesis can be determined by justifying a reference class and observing historical data, but I don't
                think Carrier agrees with this either. What he is advocating is explicitly stating what likelihoods you are using, and using a Baysian calculation to derive the certainty you claim for any claim. It's not hard to do, and
                when you do it, if you do it wrong, it is possible to criticize the assumed probabilities and to criticize the independence of the things you used, etc etc. It's not more objective, it's just more precisely stated, so that
                you can pinpoint errors of judgement, even when they are qualitative errors which require subjective judgement. This is what makes it different from "it seems to me" and "in all probability" that historians use, without a
                quantitative ballpark estimate. The reason this approach is rejected is because it INVITES abuse, and in fact, in history in the past, it has only been used for abuse. Carrier is the only historian who does it roughly right
                (but I think he makes a few inconsequential mistakes, see below--- but in the end I haven't read "Proving History" yet, and after I read that I might change my mind on his mistakes). Baysian methods require not just simple
                honesty, but a much more exacting honesty, where you actually have to ask "is this really an appropriate probability", "Are these actually independent events" and "have I missed a possible scenario which would make this
                probability estimate totally bogus". All of these are very hard to do, and the calculations are usually done better by intuition, because accumulating evidence generally quickly pushes the probabilities so close to 1 or 0
                that it's pointless to do calculations. Except in certain cases. But these are the exactly the controversial cases! But in certain cases, in those cases where academic authority has a strong consensus which comes from
                something other than strong evidence, then it is very important to look at the evidence with a Baysian lens, EVEN THOUGH this is rife for abuse. The online review and checking process can get rid of abusive Baysianism, and
                really hone down the confidence factors. Now, these are not objective facts, the probabilities, and a different person with different priors and estimates can come to different conclusions. But at least they have to STATE
                THEIR PRIORS and STATE THEIR PROBABILITIES. In a way better than "it seems to me..." and "after reviewing the evidence, the great likelihood is..." These don't work when the authoritative biases cloud the judgement, which
                unfortunately happens in history more often than it should. The reason that this method is not universally used is that it practically INVITES abuse! It is so easy to present false probabilities in this methodology. In order
                to trust the conclusion, you need a back-and-forth, like an online chat, to establish that you really aren't missing something that would completely shift the probabilities around. I'll give an example of mistakes in
                Carrier, for instance. IF the Gospel of John were REALLY independent of the Synoptics, for example, if we find out it came from Alexandria, and the Alexandria church had no communication with the Rome Church, then
                historicity goes through the roof simply on the agreement between John and the Synoptics. That means that the estimate of likelihood on independence of John is really a good estimate of historicity. Carrier effectively
                assumes we are 100% sure of the dependence between John and the Synoptics, but we are NOT, we only are 80% confident based on the evidence he gives, so it should have a 4/5 factor or so. That means that it is only 80% likely
                that the writer of John was familiar with the synoptics by oral contact, not that he was ripping them off. But this doesn't change the conclusion at all. These higher order dependencies are important when you have a bunch of
                documents which you KNOW are independent with strong likelihood, for example, the Talmud and that Greek guy writing about the Nazoreans. The fact that they both report the same thing lends essentially infinite confidence to
                the Nazoreans being the Jewish Christians, and confirms the historicity of the Nazorean references. But although I don't NEED Baysianism to state this conclusion, it doesn't hurt, so long as it is done honestly. For example
                of dishonest Baysianism, I can pretend that the Synoptics and John are independent, and then find the probability that they agree on all the details they agree on (Jeusus betrayed by Judas, Jesus having a ministry in
                Galilea, etc), and this would slam down to zero so quickly you would conclude "Jesus is historical" after about 4 points of agreement. But this is to ignore the elephant in the room of agreement by dependence. Carrier really
                is honest about it. He demonstrates his conclusion, which is NOT that there was no historical Jesus exactly, just that the historical figure is not what Paul had in mind (but maybe Peter did!), and that this historical
                figure is not the source of the Jesus presented in the Gospels, at best, some history is an additional source to Jesus in the Gospels, along with scripture and myth. The way I state it is as follows: An ancient source
                reports: one day a fox came to a field and saw a large bunch of ripe purple grapes on the tree. He jumped and jumped to get the grapes, and failed to reach them. As he walked away, he said to himself "those grapes were
                probably sour anyway". Now what can we know about the historical fox? It is quite remarkable feat of thinking for an animal like a fox, and if the fox actually spoke, it would be miraculous. Given that it was attested that
                the fox jumped to get the grapes, and knowing that grapes were common in Greece, it is safe to say that the historical fox was jumping, and the goal was to get the grapes. Although some scholars dispute that the grapes were
                purple, as it makes more sense for the latter confusion with immature and green grapes, if the grapes were green throughout. Most scholars conclude that the report that the fox then spoke are probably exaggerated. The
                historical fox probably simply walked away from the grapes without saying anything, or at least without saying anything clear, so the only clue Aesop could have had to conclude that this is what the fox was thinking must
                have been by the manner in which the historical fox walked away. I hypothesize that the fox shook his head, and made a whimpering noise of a sort, leading Aesop to conclude that the fox was hungry, and disappointed, but
                rationalizing the disappointment in this way. I also hypothesize that the historical fox never ate grapes again, due to this experience. I am sure that the fox in reality did not get the grapes by the criterion of
                embarrassment, it is quite embarrassing to make up such a remarkable fox that is nontheless unable to get grapes from a tree. Why is my discussion ridiculous? Do foxes not exist? Would they not jump for grapes? It is
                ridiculous, because the tale is obviously not a history, it is a parable illustrating an important lesson. The Gospel stories are written to illustrate an even more important lesson, namely that the cultic sacrifice of
                Judaism has ended, and the Christian religion has salvation and immortality without a direct requirement of Jerusalem temple worship. The sacrifice of Jesus parallels the passover sacrifice and the Yom Kippur sacrifice, as
                explained by Carrier, and all aspects of Jesus ministry serve an allegorical purpose in describing the manner in which Christianity sets itself apart from Judaism. The death of Jesus is symbolic and meaningful, all aspects
                of his life are presaged in the old testament. Any attempt at deducing what the historical Jesus was like is simply as hopeless as deducing what Aesop's fox was like. While it is possible that there was a historical fox, it
                is not a bet a rational person would make, nor is it particularly possible to know what that fox was doing.

            <p>I am NOT talking about a different religion, I am talking about Christianity. It is a subtle faith, it is not an obtuse superstition about a historical magic-doing guy who became a zombie for a few weeks then flew away.</p>
            <p>
                The notion of the congregation forming the body of Christ through communion, that’s there from the beginning. The spiritual center is the risen Christ, the body does works, and the notions of blood sacrifice are removed from
                the Jewish component of the faith.
            </p>
            <p>
                The historical parts of Christianity, the Gospel tales as history, this comes much later than communion, resurrection, and crucifiction, which are aspects of Paul’s earliest Epistles, and Peter’s, and have prophetic
                prefigurements in the old-testament.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can’t expose this type of historical falsehood as false, because there are no witnesses, nor do there have to be. It is written as exegesis of a religious experience, not as history, and the historical interpretation
                only takes off in the 2nd century, after everybody has died.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s not “making up stuff”, it is illustrating the faith with a simpler to understand story. The actual beliefs are tough to understand at a first exposure, it takes several years to understand what the “body of Christ”
                means, what communion means, etc. What it means that cultic sacrifice has ended, what it means to have a vision, or speak in tongues, etc, etc. The story “ok, this guy came to Earth, preached, died, and resurrected” gets the
                main idea across with the minimum of fuss, and gets the quickest conversion, and when it was composed, it is not clear it was thought of as historically true, historically false, as I think the answer Christians back then
                would have given is “who the heck cares? We’re not here to give you a history lecture, we are after saving your soul.”

                The experience of the risen Jesus as far as I can tell is not exactly unambiguous in the way a scientific experiment is. It is an internal experience that comes with indications and what subjectively feels like
                communication, but it isn’t in words you can write down, nor can you be sure of the accuracy of the conclusion. The doctrine of the Church isn’t a lie, it just doesn’t look like history.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my opinion, a person who demands that the events of their religion must have exact replica copies on Earth has a very poor faith. Must the material world be an exact replica of the spirit realm? The spirit realm of
                Christianity is an abstraction, a Platonic idealization whose rough ugly mirror is the material world, and the claim here of Carrier and the mythicists is that the perfect crucifiction and resurrection are attributes of the
                Platonic realm, not exactly of the messy historical realm.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know it is heresy for all denominations, but heretical or not, I don’t see it in conflict with the ethical and spiritual message of Christianity. I also see it as concordant with the ethical and spiritual message of
                Wolfgang Pauli and Rudolph Carnap, who are interested in the study of the material world, not the spiritual world.

                I disagree that it is a lie. It wouldn’t be seen as a lie by those who composed it, and it wouldn’t be seen as a lie by those who propagated it, and it would gradually turn into what you are calling a lie only later, when a
                fundamentalist historical interpretation trumped the allegorical interpretation sometime in the 2nd century. But even if the final interpretation is a historical lie (although it’s arguable, I guess it is, in the sense you
                say), no one person would be responsible for lying, certainly it’s not Jesus’s fault, and everyone is working in good faith througout. The only purpose of the literal interpretation is quicker conversion of people who aren’t
                well versed enough to see the theological subtleties and visions, it’s not like every missionary has the time to get people to go through however many years of seminary studies to join the religion.

                I didn’t claim “Nazorean” is “Notzar”, although in Hebrew the two terms coincide almost exactly, but “Nazorean” isn’t “Nazarethian” either (in Greek, I mean, Carrier discusses the subtle distinctions in the book)! Both
                interpretations are not a 100% match, and neither gives good confidence either way. Unlike Carrier, I consider such a thing some evidence for historicity, but it’s extremely WEAK evidence for historicity, it’s a Baysian
                factor of 2/3 at best, and it only comes from the dependence of dependent sources, so really 2/3 is the best factor for nonsense like this.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I say you couldn’t do it for “Canaanite”, what I mean is that there is a PLAUSIBLE mythicist argument for Nazorean, which could be a coincidence, but it also could be the actual reason for the term. That’s something
                that would happen if the Christians called themselves “Samaritans” (from Shomer, keeping tradition), but not if they called themselves “Galileans”. So it’s just not a very good piece of evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am NOT following Carrier in doing Baysian probabilities on these sorts of things, I have been advocating this as a way to quantify opinion for over a decade, independently of him. Scientists use Baysian tools to quantify
                the strength of evidence, and use Baysian arguments to avoid the pitfalls of authority based evaluation, where reinforcing expert opinions drown out the comparatively ambiguous evidence. Baysianism is a TOOL to describe your
                biases, and a tool for seeing how different evidence comes together to support or refute a hypothesis, it is not a way of making false objectivity where there is none.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is also a tool that is very easy to abuse, because by claiming improbabilities that are not there, you can convince yourself of almost anything. It takes a heck of a lot of training for scientists to do it right, and you
                need to know when confidence is overwhelming. There are lot of three sigma signals in physics (99.9% confidence ostensibly) which are false, because of the cherry-picking issue. Scientists generally want 5 sigma evidence (1
                in a million baysian confidence of error). You don’t get 5 sigma evidence in history unless you have solidly independent sources with careful attestation and very reliable reporting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Carrier is doing it, but he isn’t doing it perfectly. He is the first to do it in history correctly, others who do it do it in an extremely biased way. His Baysian comparison of the hypothesis is roughly accurate, except for
                things that are subtle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The subtle things are how to deal with correlations in evidence, how to quantify expectations, and how to deal with the specificity of theories. These are “higher order effects”, and they do not change the conclusion in the
                Jesus case very much.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think that it is possible to see with good confidence that the Jesus of the Gospels is a mythical creation, which does not derive from any single historical source with connection to Peter. It might include elements of
                other people, including a Galilean preacher named “Lazarus”, a (different) Zealot named “Simon” crucified in the middle of summer, not during Passover (I’m making these people up), and that Judah dude who stormed the Temple
                in ~ AD 60 saying “The end is nigh”, but whichever historical narratives contributed to the story, the elements are incorporated into a legend of a composite character at best, there is no single character that produced the
                mythology. The single most important factor in the mythology is the RESURRECTED CHRIST, the divine figure who replaces Temple worship. That this figure came FIRST, and the rest retrofitted to fit this figure, this is what
                Carrier is persuasively arguing, at least in Paul’s theology (we have little direct evidence of Peter’s theology).

                The reason one would “make up” a Messiah who gets nailed to a stick is because you COMMUNICATED with the risen Jesus, decided he must be the Messiah, so therefore he came and went, and looked around you and saw that nothing
                materially changed in the world, therefore, the Messiah must have come and gone without altering the material world. This means he came and went as an ordinary person, not as an Earthly king. His kingdom is solely in heaven.

                The crucifiction idea comes from Psalm 20-something, pierced my hand and feet, cast lot for my clothes, the persecution by Jews and their involvment in the death from Isiah 53. These sources are not baseless Christian
                apologia, they really are prophesies of Jesus. The reason is simply that these are the sources from which belief in the crucifiction and resurrection emerged.
            </p>
            <p>
                The “criterion of embarassment” doesn’t work for Jewish scripture, because there is so much prophesy and text, and it is taken so seriously, that reconciling the texts and reconciling those texts with national historical
                events produces even MORE contradiction and embarassment than any historical memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fulfilment of prophecy is not accidental in Christianity, it is really fulfilling the prophecies of the Messiah. Really. This is not because a historical event got transmogrified (at least, not most plausibly), most
                probably it is because Peter had a vision, Paul had the same vision (more or less), and they communicated it as best they could.
            </p>
            <p>
                The emergence of churches worshipping the risen Christ is not an argument for historical Christ, it is an argument for AUTHENTICITY, that the experience of the risen Christ was representing a true revelation. Those were held
                in higher regard by the Jews than any historically accurate memory.

                The problem with historicity is that it isn’t the miracles that have anything to do with the religion. It’s the crucifiction and resurrection. These events are what are central to Christianity, not any supernatural events.
                The resurrection itself is not miraculous either in a historical view, it is people seeing a dead person in their mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                This interpretation is simply problematic, not just because the historical record doesn’t support it (see Carrier’s book), but also because of the role the risen Jesus plays. The experience of the risen Jesus is not that of
                a ghost, it is something that people have today, it is an important experience, and it probably pre-dates Christianity.
            </p>
            <p>
                To postulate that the Christians took the risen Jesus (which is a real experience) and associated it with a historical person is a coincidence theory, it requires that the spiritual experience coincided with a flesh and
                blood teacher who was crucified at the right time, around the right person (Peter) who could have a vision of the risen Jesus, then identify it with the historical Jesus, so as to make the theology work.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is simply not the most parsimonious theory. The most parsimonious theory is that Peter had the experience of the risen Jesus, then looked around in Jewish scriptures to figure out what figure Jesus would be. He decided
                it was a crucified messiah (whether in the heavens or on Earth he couldn’t know and didn’t care). Then Paul had the EXACT SAME EXPERIENCE, and associated it with the EXACT SAME FIGURE, nearly independently (that it is not
                completely independent is due to Paul persecuting the first Christians). This is not at all improbable, it is analogous to Newton and Leibnitz discovering calculus, since Leibnitz was about as familiar with Newton’s methods
                as Paul would have been familiar with Peter’s theology. Then they compare notes a little, decide they are compatible theologically, sort out their differences, and Paul goes to preach to the Gentiles, while Peter preaches to
                the Jews.
            </p>
            <p>
                This hypothesis predicts that the historical sources come later than the initial vision of the risen Christ. The opposite view would predict the opposite, that the historical tales come first, and the risen Christ later.
                While it is tough to distinguish, the evidence does support the mythicist position, but you need to read all of it first, to see that it does. This is what Carrier argues persuasively.

                The non-historical view is that the people were NOT nuts to worship Jesus, because Jesus was not an ordinary man who appeared on Earth. Jesus was a divine being right from the start. It is only the story of his life as a man
                which was inserted into the historical record, God inserting himself into the historical record, in a sense, through the action of the religious community.

                No, no no. True Christianity has always been a SPIRITUAL modification of Judaism, with which it shares a historical notion of God, and a synchretism with Platonism, with which it shares the notion of heaven, perfectibility,
                and afterlife.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point of Paul and Peter’s authentic epistles is to induce the experience of the risen Christ. The risen Christ is not the historical Christ, and has no relation to the historical Christ a-priori. The risen Christ binds
                the community through communion, and produces spiritual awakening in those who are dead in spirit.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sacrifice of Jesus on the cross as flesh Messiah is revealed to Paul and Peter, and is interpreted as removing the idea of blood sacrifice from Judaism. This is the revelation that allows the religion to start and grow,
                and it has nothing to do with the historical Jesus. It doesn’t matter WHERE Jesus was crucified, it doesn’t matter WHO crucified him, it doesn’t even matter WHO HE WAS, so long as he was Messiah, he embodied the spiritual
                son and effective angel of God, and he was crucified somewhere, in whatever manner. Jesus does this so as to produce a new form of religion, independent of temple sacrifice, and it has no importance what historical event is
                associated with this, and most likely, none is (although it is possible that there was a historical event that got merged into the story, it isn’t required, and the historical event is not important at all).
            </p>
            <p>
                The earliest Gospel is designed to produce a historical story, just to EXPLAIN the concepts of the religion, so you can understand this stuff. The concepts of the risen Jesus are very subtle, and require a lot of background
                knowledge. The concept in the Gospel of Mark are immediately understandable, and convert people based on the story alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                But you can understand Mark, and then Matthew and then Luke and John, as evolutions of the historical story which illustrates the important features of the risen Christ. The only point of Carrier’s book is to argue that the
                risen Christ is primary, and the historical Christ is tacked on later.

                This is simply ridiculous— if you think that seeing the risen Jesus in the mind is a lie, as compared to seeing Jesus in the flesh, you have never experienced the risen Christ in the mind. It is among the most powerful
                events in a person’s life, and it will completely rewire their relation to other people and their interpretation of events, and their relation to religious text. This is not arguable, because it happens to people all the
                time (talk to Christians who have experienced Christ), and it even happens to atheistic non-Christians (it happened to me).
            </p>
            <p>
                Peter’s probably authenetic epistle, Paul’s authentic epistles, these without doubt talk exclusively about the experience of the risen Christ, the same exact thing you can experience, the same exact things Christians preach
                and experience today. This experience is very subtle, is consistent with Jewish theology, and has nothing to do with supernatural events.
            </p>
            <p>
                The identification of the risen Christ with the Messiah (which both Peter and Paul share) means that the flesh Messiah has already come and gone, but without altering the material relation of Rome and Judea. This historical
                circumstance is what implies that the Messiah is not working on Earth immediately, that the kingdom is in heaven, and it’s Earthly manifestation begins slowly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The kingdom of Christ begins with his replacing of the temple sacrifice through his own sacrifice, and explains why he must be crucified. It is prefigured in Psalm (Psalm twenty-something, about the crucifiction), and this
                is what can be very convincingly understood from other scripture too, Daniel, Isiah 53, and the method of Jewish theology at the time will produce a Christology without a historical figure, and further, the Christology that
                it produces is exactly the Christology of the Epistles.
            </p>
            <p>
                The credibility of the story does NOT come from history, true history simply doesn’t produce convincing evidence for people who are being converted to a spiritual religion. Eyewitness attestations are forgotten, nobody cares
                to preserve historical memory except historians. Actual historically provable exceptional events, like the HUGE supernova in 1054 or so (we know about it because we see the remnant crab nebula) are barely attested to in
                history. But spiritual events are attested, especially ones which are socially meaningful and produce change.
            </p>
            <p>
                The “new story” would not be new, as the story would be humanized from the beginning. It starts with “Do you know Christ appeared in the flesh and died for your sins to assure your salvation?”, and the details are added by
                missionaries and proselyzers, without any tradition. You don’t NEED a tradition, other than the Jewish literary tradition, because you are explaining a spiritual truth.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fact that it is spiritually true, meaning that it does produce transformative change in people’s ethics, means that it has no relevance to history, simply because historical truth is useless and stupid for producing
                spiritual change. This is the view of early Church founders, who resist the false claims to objectivity of their Pagan overlords.
            </p>
            <p>
                All powerful orders claim that their order is scientifically supported, and say “logic is on our side”. The Christians were not arguing with logic, they were arguing with spiritual power, and the historicity arguments only
                came slowly, as the Chuch became powerful and needed unanimous acceptance of doctrine, by even those who are spiritually obtuse and can’t experience a risen Christ directly nor understand those who do indirectly.

                Peter didn’t “make up” Jesus! He had an experience of the risen Jesus, something that many people have had even today. John doesn’t say “I spent 3 years with Jesus”, another anonymous author, writing to piously mythologize
                the early church, writes this as a proselyizing tool, at least 50 years later, and possibly a hundred years later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paul doesn’t just fail to mention Jesus healing, he treats Jesus as a celestial figure whose only Earthly manifestation is to get crucified somewhere (Paul doesn’t say exactly where, Carrier argues with some confidence that
                it’s in the lower heavens). Clement has the same view. You need to read Carrier’s book instead of attacking straw-men, as he addresses these at length.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for the psychology making sense— the experience of the risen Jesus is REAL, and it is POWERFUL, and there is no need for a tacked-on historical Jesus to allow it to change the world. Simply the text of the Epistle to
                Philemon, which spells the beginning of the end of ancient slavery, is enough to allow the Church to be both ethically true and growing.

                Carrier doesn’t claim it was forgery. He claims the risen Jesus came first. The teachings of the risen Jesus are primary in Christianity, the historical narratives are simply proselyzing tools, and are written to illustrate
                the central tenets.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is nothing contradictory about this, nor does it make the documents “forgeries”. They are parables, not forgeries, and they are no more historical than any other scriptural source that claims to take place in history.
            </p>
            <p>
                This hypothesis must be weighed on its merits, using as objective a methodology as possible, because of the biases of people coming in. This is not just the bias of religious dogma, it is the bias of superficial common
                sense, that when you see a document showing a historical figure doing works that you should believe the easiest way for this to get composed is if there were a historical figure doing works. When you see details, especially
                embarassing details, these are true details. Both these criteria fail miserably for Jewish religious sources, because the Jewish sources insert characters into history to make points, and do so often, writing consistent
                narratives for these people, and further the sources of Jewish myths are in a vast literature, which is enormous, and the motivation to reconcile conflicting myths is so large when producing pseudo-history, that reconciling
                them often produces embarassment without historical input (for example, Abraham and Sarah, two mythical beings, are embarassingly half-siblings in Genesis).
            </p>
            <p>
                Historicity is simply false in this case, because you can trace the development of the documents very thoroughly, and show that the mythicist position explains the evidence much much better than the historicist position.
                This is what Carrier does in a readable 617 pages. Carrier’s thesis doesn’t really argue that Christianity is a lie, simply that Jesus is not a historical character. It doesn’t even argue that it is a false teaching, as the
                historical Jesus is not the risen Jesus of the congregation that Christians actually worship and experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main event in Christianity in this view is Paul seeing Peter’s risen Jesus (same as modern Christians do), coming to Rome, founding the Gentile church, ignoring Mosaic law, and writing the Epistle to Philemon (among
                others). The resonance of the religion is that it treated everyone equally, slaves and freepersons, and it made the least first (as attested to in Philemon). The Church explodes because of these social forces, not because
                what it teaches is historically true.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ll put it this way— if there was a person named Joshua who historically died and rose from the grave 3 days later, surrounded by actual supernatural events, we would never hear about it today. Nobody would believe it, nor
                would there be any motivation for anyone to preserve the witness of this experience. To demonstrate— meteorites fell all over the world, but none of the experiences of rocks falling from the sky were thought to be
                particularly worth preserving, despite the supernatural-seeming event being so salient. True history is not enough, you need to have a political movement behind you.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, the spiritual experience of witnessing the risen Christ, a real event in people’s lives which happens today, something which has nothing to do with the historical Christ, this is a solid foundation to
                build a religion on. This foundation is what Carrier is assuming, he is simply jettisoning the unnecessary and problematic historical interpretation of the Gospel narratives.

                Carrier shows how to overcome these problems and evaluate this evidence— you have to ask whether “Nazorean” is an indication of a historical source at a historical “Nazareth” or whether “Nazorean” is an indication of
                something else. “Nazorean” has some meaning in Hebrew, as “notzar” means “formed” in the sense of “manufactured”, the same as Carrier proposes for the body of Christ. The existence of symbolic meaning you could make up is
                true of a lot of places, but not of “Bethlehemi” or “Beer Shevite” or “Canaanite” for example. Since the word has some plausibly related meaning, it is not completely ad-hoc that Mark made Nazareth the town (whether it
                existed or not) just to retro-fit “Nazorean”, neither it is implausible that it derives from the history, you just can’t say with any solid confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                That just means that you don’t really know where “Nazorean” came from, and the assertion that it is good evidence is simply problematic. It is evidence, but it is simply another piece of weak evidence made to look strong by
                reinforcing myth, and contradicting myth. The best you can argue for the occurence of Nazareth is that it gives mythicism a 2/3 confidence factor at best, but this is a problem, because it can’t counterweight the other
                evidence which suggests mythicism at the many hundreds to 1 level, much much stronger than Carrier conservatively states.
            </p>
            <p>
                I should say that since “mythicism” does not have a specific prediction for any of this stuff, historicity needs to get a better factor in a Baysian analysis— simply for predicting a consistent birthplace (which is what is
                observed). But the consistency is in strongly dependent sources, which reduces the confidence to at best something like 2/3. Mythicism would not care if the birthplace was consisten, or if you have wild gospels claiming
                Jesus is from elsewhere This is a methodological weakness in Carrier’s method, the specificity of the predictions are not taken into account in the method. This would make a good rebuttal to the claims in the book, but in
                the specific case of Jesus, the rebuttals are not solid.

                It’s not a seizure. It’s a pretty well reproducible thing, it is like a voice from outside talking in your head, but without words exactly, although saying specific things. It is not a hallucination in the normal sense, it’s

                I had this experience after reading the 120 Days of Sodom by Sade (which I consequently think is purposefully designed to induce this experience in an atheist). I would recommend this for understanding Paul’s vision. Not
                only is it not a hallucination, it is not even FALSE, in that it is teaching you true ethical things. That Paul had a true ethical epiphane can be witnessed in the earliest and greatest document of Christianity: The Epistle

                Paul thinks it is true that Jesus rose from the deead, because he has had a revelation of the risen Christ. This is not an uncommon vision, it happens today still, perhaps it has happened to you, it has happened to me. The
                stories of the historical Christ are there to give a historical anchor to these otherwise otherworldly visitations of the risen Christ. Paul doesn’t need material confirmation— he is a sincere religious person.

                The need to move Jesus to Bethlehem in the mythicist framework is due to the need to reconcile two conflicting sources of myth. The “Nazoreans” name for the early Jewish Christians, which led Mark to place Jesus in Nazareth,
                and a separate OT tradition that the Messiah is born in Bethlehem.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you see a concocted story in a Jewish source, it is in the context of hundreds of invisible scriptural sources you don’t see, and reconciling them is just as important for the authors as reconciling history would be to
                others who are not living in a world of Biblical literature.
            </p>
            <p>
                This type of evidence is equally compatible with both ideas, although superficially, given modern biases to reconcile to history rather than to prophecy and tradition, we don’t see this. Similar “embarassing” stories can be
                found in the OT, for example, if Abraham and Sarah are not real people, why are they described as brother and sister in one of the two “pimping to a king” stories? Incestuous ancestry is a sign of weakness and accursedness.

            <p>
                I am not sure about Carrier’s identification of the “Davidic sperm bank”, although it is a good deduction from Carrier mythicism. The only reason I doubt is because Carrier did not establish that his scenario is really the
                only plausible minimal scenario.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a second scenario for mythicism which is nearly identical to his, but places Jesus on Earth (as myth). The statement would be that the messiah came and went anonymously, on Earth, without telling anyone. Then the
                heavenly Platonic Messiah revealed to people to announce the ascension.
            </p>
            <p>
                This hypothesis would take the same evidence as Carrier’s version of mythicism, but would not require any change in the interpretation of “born of woman”, “of the sperm of David”, etc. It really should have been clumped
                together with Carrier’s heavenly Jesus as a combined minimal mythicist.
            </p>
            <p>
                But this is a quibble, as the evidence for a celestial Jesus is pretty good in Carrier’s chapter on the Epistles, actually better than the idea of an anonymous messiah. I would put it at 4 to 1 for Carrier’s over mine, even
                though my prior when I came in was 2 to 1 the other way.
            </p>
            <p>The anonymous messiah is still a good half-way house in the historization process, and it can appear in different people, as there is no need for Paul or Peter to take any firm position on historicity in public.</p>

                I should say, Michael Behe also has a case to make, but he is not identifying God in the cell, he is seeing the intelligence of RNA networks. That’s more brains than modern synthesis, but infinitely less brains than a
                supernatural God.

            <p>
                The celestial story could be primary, I agree, I just read the last part of Carrier, and there are celestial references. But the celestial events mirror Earthly events, so that there are Earthly analogs of celestial events.
                Any random crucifiction could be seen as the crucifiction of Jesus in this view, and there is no barrier to making a mythology from composites of martyr stories, as Carrier demonstrates happened later.

                If the conjectured theology is definitive on the location of Christ, it is less minimal, you are adding another factor without certain probability— namely that it was certain that Paul didn’t believe Christ appeared on Earth
                (anonymously) for crucifiction, and I don’t think Paul really gave a crap. He only cared about the risen Christ.

                The Maccabees, Ned Ludd, and Betty Crocker can be placed into history the same as Jesus, and all are fabrications. The case for Jesus is closed, Carrier has closed it, he is not a historical person. He is far too
                conservative in his probability estimates, just to appear reasonable.

            <p>
                Richard Carrier wrote the definitive books about the subject, and the argument about historicity should already be closed. Jesus is mythical, there is very little doubt left about this after Carrier, and any argument against
                his conclusion had better involve new evidence, or a persuasive demonstratio of some dependency not previously accounted for by Carrier.
            </p>
            <p>
                This has very little to do with Christian faith. I believe Carrier’s version gives a more persuasive Christian faith than the traditional historical story, which makes the risen Jesus into an accident of a mangled historical
                memory. That’s not what Jesus is, Jesus is purposely crafted to fulfil messianic prophesy, which is why Christian apologetics is stronger than any historical coincidence will allow.

                This is a nonsensical comment to make, whatever the plural, Carrier has written an extremely strong book, a great classic. His arguments are entirely sound, and they lead to a revolutionary understanding of the literature in

                His historical research is impeccable, and his conclusions regarding the Gospels, the background material, the Epistles, and Acts are close to the only possible ones from the modern Biblical studies literature. He has really
                proved his case, and there should be no argument anymore.
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, academics are bound by academic inertia, and he will face tremendous irrational resistance. The inevitable crucifiction of his classic book might make a Christian out of him yet.</p>

            <p>
                What you see is Jesus humanized ALL AT ONCE in the Gospel of Mark, and then more mythology added in subsequent gospels. That’s not a “mythologizing process”, as the predictions of gradual mythologizing don’t accord with
                previous or outside source material, and don’t make sense in context, nor with the stories in the gospels, despite superficial impressions of uninformed people who didn’t do the research. This is why you need to read

                There is nothing unusual or wrong in Galileo’s behavior— you have to trust the self-correcting mechanism to correct you when you are wrong. Galileo had hundreds of arguments, and a few of them are invariable wrong, as is

                around smaller objects. Galilean relativity showed that we wouldn’t feel the spinning of the Earth, and the only thing Galileo didn’t explain was Kepler’s laws, which were formulated contemporaneously.
            </p>
            <p>But the evidence in the 3rd century BC was ALSO undeniably correct! Just the equant system and epicycle periods are enough to conclude from Baysian analysis that Heliocentrism is correct with extremely high probability.</p>

            <p>Sure, each figure is different. But when you examine Jesus, the argument for historicity is generally that “I can make a consistent picture for a historical character which would plausibly produce this text”.</p>
            <p>
                The problem is that you can always do this for Jewish religious myth, because Jewish religious myth is by design historical. Pagan religious myths don’t necessarily claim anything about history, and don’t go to pains to make
                themselves sound historically plausible.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second problem with this in the special case of Jesus is that really, NO YOU CAN’T construct a good historical narrative. Without the supernatural elements at least. Such a historical narrative would leave a gaping
                question: How the heck did Jesus get deified???
            </p>
            <p>
                The deification of a human in Judaism is simply impossible and seems to have been impossible even back then, in that it only happened once (in Christianity). Jews resisted adopting human figures into the pantheon of angels,
                only doing so in cases which made a clear distinction between the human and the divine (for example, Elijah). The deification of Jesus is extremely surprising, and there is no indication that it began later in Rome, Paul’s
                early epistles deify Christ right from the beginning.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a Jewish context, it is simply more plausible that Jesus was a divine figure right rom the start. This just makes a better mesh of theology, and explains how Paul can advocate this, while remaining a Jew. It explains how
                Peter’s sect remains Jewish. They are not deifying a human, they are humanizing an archangel.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before understanding this, I struggled even to understand how Christianity could claim to be monotheistic. In Carrier’s view, there is no problem, and Christianity and Judaism mesh together perfectly. In fact, all the
                elements of Christianity are already present in messianic Judaism in one form or another, even the suffering Christ messiah in the Suffering Servant passage in Isiah.
            </p>
            <p>
                This perfect meshing of theology is just icing on the cake. Carrier didn’t start with this to make his argument, it simply adds evidence from theological consideration. this is weaker evidence than Carrier’s, which is not
                theological (it’s not about religious ideas which he doesn’t understand very well at all) but about history.

            <p>
                This is historically incorrect, as the heliocentric model predicted things that are surprising in the Geocentric model. The first is that one can get the DISTANCE to the planets from the data. The epicycle period in
                Ptolmeian astronomy is always derived from the orbit of the Earth for all three outer planets, and it always has a basic period of 1 Earth year (this is not exactly true, the right statement is that you can calculate the
                epicycle period from the planet’s distance from the Earth, and it converges to 1 year for far-away planets). For Jupiter and Saturn, the epicycle is 1 year to a good approximation, and this is better explained as parallax,
                otherwise it is a coincidence that it is 1 year.
            </p>
            <p>So interpreting the epicycle motion as parallax gives also the distance to mars, and allows you to reconstruct the entire orbit of Mars, as Kepler did.</p>
            <p>
                The second thing that is surprising is that the Sun is bigger than the Earth and all the planets. This was known in antiquity, as the distance to the moon and that the distance to the sun was much greater were both known.
                The radius of the moon could be inferred as about 1/5 of the Earth, and that of sun at least 20 times greater. It made more sense of the smaller object to circle the larger one, and this was an early argument for
                heliocentrism.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the most damning argument was the equant. In the heliocentric system, the equant is comprehensible as an equal-area law for the orbits around the sun, and the equants for the epicycles can be derived from the equant for
                the Earth (the ellipticity of the Earth’s orbit). In the geocentric model, these are simply conspiratorial parameter choices.
            </p>
            <p>So NO, it is not right that geocentrism was favored, or Brahe’s model, heliocentrism was obviously correct from the start, and only academic inertia prevented people from recognizing it.</p>

                Your idea is that Jesus belongs in the class of “failed messianic claimants” assumes minimal historicity right from the start. Thiis is an arguable point, the whole point of the book is to argue if this is the right class.
                “Failed messianic claimant” is in fact the class that Carrier puts him in under “minimal historicity”, but since he is comparing to “minimal mythicism”, to assign him to this class a-priori would be to decide the question
                before doing the analysis. Carrier does not even make it as specific as that— he simply leaves the class of historicist theory vague, because that would allow for the highest possible probability of the historicist theory
                being correct.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason it is not clear that this is the right category is that the earliest references to Jesus are immediately as a divine figure intermediate between God and Man, an archangel of sorts, as this is how he appears in
                both 1 Peter and in Paul’s authentic epistles. You could argue that this is a deification of a failed messianic claimant, or argue that the messianic story evolved as a parable of the divine figure. It all depends on whether
                Jesus was human first, or divine first. Carrier argues “divine first”, and this is also the position of the religious person, who has direct experience with the divine Jesus, but can only infer a historical Jesus through a
                confrontation with very historically dubious literature which only really makes complete sense as an exegesis of the divine Jesus.
            </p>
            <p>Carrier’s “translation to numbers” is NOT used to intimidate readers, or give false precision. He doesn’t claim that the numbers are any better than the informal argument that he gives to justify the numbers.</p>
            <p>
                The only purpose of the numbers is as a SANITY CHECK, to make sure the evidence is strong or weak, according to the criteria he is using. You could formulate your argument for historicity using the same method, and come up
                with your own numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason he uses the Baysian approach is because people come into this with PREEXISTING CRAZY NARRATIVES in their head! These narratives are constructed because the material is spiritually extremely powerful, and so lends
                itself to imagining all sorts of historical stuff just from mental resonance, and you come to see a whole bunch of pictures behind the limited (but powerful) events described in the sources. Because there is such a paucity
                of sources, he needs to really be careful about what is being said and where, to avoid the trap of a self-reinforcing but wrong loop.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is not by accident, it is common in Jewish Biblical literature. The Jewish narratives are both myth and pseudo-history, in that they are constructed to get you to argue about the details, and in this way accept the big
                picture of the narrative. You can argue if Moses was speaking Egyptian as a child and therefore had a Hebrew-as-a-second-language accent in his dialogue, or whether his writings were translated to Hebrew later, or whatever,
                while missing the main point that Moses doesn’t exist as a historical figure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Carrier really doesn’t abuse numbers in his book (unlike everyone else who uses Baysianism in history). He uses the numbers only to make the arc of the argument clear. His REAL argument is contained in the summary of
                “background material”, which reveals that the actual support for historicity is on really very shaky grounds, because most historians only support historicity by default, because they are not well versed enough in the
                background to realize that the apologetic arguments are really not very strong.
            </p>
            <p>
                In those cases where there is a limited amount of evidence, the only way to extract the best predictions is to try and do a Baysian analysis honestly. He really does do it as honestly as his imagination and source material
                allows, if you have a nit to pick with the treatment of the evidence, you can simply SAY what mistake he made, and give your own numbers. I’ll do that below.
            </p>
            <p>
                His methodology is in principle sound, it is used with much greater precision in the hard sciences. There, the evidence is much more easily quantifiable, and the error bounds are much smaller. But a solid argument is a solid
                argument, and in principle, all solid arguments can be translated to Baysian terms, although in the case of history (as Carrier says), it is not something which creates new arguments ex-nihilo, it is just a simple
                translation of the informal argument into numbers, which allows you to make a quantitative estimate of plausilbity. This is a formalization of existing method, rather than a “radical new thing”. The reason it is important is
                because it allows you to milk the most out of a limited amount of evidence, and most importantly, to detect bogus arguments in those cases where historians have inferred too much from limited evidence. He then argues that
                this is one of those cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the methodological assumptions that I question is his assumption of independent probabilities. This is a methodological mistake that allows dishonest practitioners to get whatever answer they want from Baysianism, but
                in this case it is not too bad, because he is really honest, and he factors out the main thing— dependence of sources— right from the outset. Whenever there is a good chance for dependence, he doesn’t consider evidence
                independent.
            </p>
            <p>
                When carrier finds a piece of evidence is 10% likely in the hypothesis he’s testing, he adds this evidence by multiplying by 1/10. If he later finds another piece of evidence is 10% likely, he’ll add that one too as an
                independent factor. He then assumes that the conjunction of both pieces of evidence is 1/100 likely, by multiplying probabilities. This is normally correct, when the evidence is independent, but there are two extremes to
                consider.
            </p>
            <p>
                One he takes into account by “dependence”. If the first 10% event entails the next 10% event, then they are not independent, and you have to throw one of the two away. Ok. But you need to know the probability of dependence
                to make this rigorous. He usually assumes a binary model— 0 or 1, either they are dependent or they are independent. Good enough for this case, it wouldn’t necessarily work in other cases.
            </p>
            <p>But there’s another problem, which never comes up in hard sciences or in Bayes’s theorem as traditionally stated, where the conjunction of the two events is much less likely than the product. I’ll give an example:</p>
            <p>
                I was curious about what we could learn about Peter’s church. I find there’s a reference to the Nazoreans in the Babylonian Talmud. Ok. That could be copied from the Gospels. But then Carrier gives a separate source,
                independent of NT and Talmud, which also cites the Nazoreans and gives doctrine which matches the Talmud description. The other source could ALSO have been cribbed from the Gospels, if it were isolated. But with the Talmud,
                the two sources reinforce each other, so that the confidence that the Petrine Nazoreans survive and continue becomes effectively certain, even though each fact by itself would only have provided 80-90% confidence of this
                conclusion by itself. The two facts together, because of the implausible matching of confirming details, is much much more certain, effectively 1 part in 10^10 certain, or some such thing. This could be turned into
                Baysianism if you quantified how likely the details were to match by random chance, but you shouldn’t bother in this case, because this probability is effectively zero. That’s because the details-matching is hard to
                quantify, but it is the main job of the historian. When historians find two matching independent sources, they are happy. That’s because of this effect I described.
            </p>
            <p>
                But in the case of the gospels, Carrier effectively argues that they are not at all independent, that with high probability they are commenting and ammending each other. But a historian using the traditional criterion of
                “independent sources” would conclude that John and the Synoptics are independent, without strong evidence of this, when they are really nothing of the kind, at least not with any high probability. The false inference would
                give the same strong confirmation-feeling for historicity, when it is really not justified by the evidence in the two documents. It is only a consequence of the reinforcing pseudo-history in both narratives being mildly
                consistent with each other, and with the historian’s picture in their head of the “real underlying events behind this”. Jewish Biblical literature is precisely DESIGNED to fool the reader in this way.
            </p>
            <p>
                These methodological details are why he wrote a book about Baysian history. This is why I think the historicity book is such a classic, because it really uses a justified method to show that previous arguments are invalid.
            </p>
            <p>
                One way to argue against Carrier is to say that while each INDIVIDUAL piece of evidence for historicity sucks, the sum total is better than the parts, because of concordant matching. This I think is a BAD argument, but you
                can make it. It is essentially why people are stuck on this point, they think that the argument is valid in the case of Jesus, when it’s not (because even the conjunction of all the historicity evidence is crappy). What they
                are REALLY saying is “I can SEE the historical Jesus in my head when I read the Gospels! His personality is coming right out at me!” But this is also true of the historical Moses, it is true of the historical Daniel, because
                the Jewish writing style made distinct personalities that embodied certain philosophies, and different writers got to know these fictional characters and wrote to form. This is not evidence, it is a feeling, and it is a
                misleading feeling in most cases, as there is no historical Moses, and there is no historical Daniel (as Carrier also convincingly argues in a subpart of the book).
            </p>
            <p>
                I disagree with Carrier on one rather central point. He claims that his “minimal mythicism” is in fact, minimal mythicism, in that if you change any one point, the theory becomes so implausible it is not worth considering. I
                think here he just had a failure of the imagination.
            </p>
            <p>
                One can agree with him that Peter and Paul saw a resurrected Jesus (no historical Jesus) without agreeing that the Jesus was necessarily crucified in the firmament. Jesus could have also decended to Earth anonymously, and
                got crucified anonymously, without letting on he was the messiah. His firmament theory also makes sense, but I think the other one needs to be considered, because it is equally minimal.
            </p>
            <p>
                The “more minimal mythicism” just stays agnostic on where Jesus decended, and allows different sects to identify different Jesuses as the historical manifestation of the cosmic Jesus (the historical figures don’t even have
                to be named Jesus, they just have to get crucified in some way). So you can have one sect adopt a stoned and crucified Jesus ben Panthera or something, and another sect make up a historical narrative about a Jesus of
                Galilea, whatever. The convergence process will happen because the believers are coordinating with each other. But Carrier’s cosmic Jesus crucified in the firmament is not too different, and itself outdoes the standard story
                for matching the evidence. I think the “more minimal mythicist” Jesus is slightly better Baysianwise, but the arguments are identical for the most part.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am persuaded of Carrier’s thesis simply because I am familiar with the risen Christ, I know how the visions of this work, and I do not believe this cosmic presence could possibly be constructed by Jews simply by
                misidentifying the ghost of a living mortal teacher. I believe the God Jesus inserted himself into history, as a fabrication. But that’s subjective nonsense, Carrier presents a good objective case.

            <p>
                Carrier presents the Raglan criteria informally, and with his biases present, and he explained his biases in detail, and explained the parallels explicitly. This is not an exact science, so he explains each judgement call he
                made on page 233, and he encourages YOU to DO THE SAME, using your own judgement, and compare with his approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                I did it myself, I didn’t agree on all points, and I came up with a somewhat lower score for Jesus, as I disagreed with him on the agreement regarding descent from nobility (for example), a few points here and there. The
                confrontation with Satan in the Wilderness definitely is an analog of the Raglan confrontation with a great adversary, and the ministry is quite parallel to the crown in the standard story, but they are not exact matches
                (because they never are).
            </p>
            <p>
                This is not a numerical game, or a trick, it’s an analysis of narrative parallels, and it is impossible to disagree that Jesus matches the narrative arc of the Raglan hero to a good degree, because Jesus simply DOES match
                this narrative arc to a good degree. You are only quibbling to what extent, and whether the criteria are verbatim the same as Raglan. It makes no difference at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                The question of whether the hero is “descended from a king” or “is the heir of a king”, or whatever, is not a criterion which is sharp, like “is this material a solid or a gas”. Jesus fits this criterion halfway, in that he
                is of the line of David, but not really nobility. “The body is not buried” means that “nobody knows where he ended up”, more precisely “nobody is sure if he is dead”. It appears in literature everywhere regarding characters
                who you don’t want to believe have died. Carrier stated it in the proper spirit, although you can quibble with the precise wording, it is clear that Jesus fits this criterion adequately. The “becomes a king” again is a
                judgement call, whether you consider Christ’s anointing as the messiah as kinglike or not. But the general agreement is ok, although as always imperfect. You are really picking nits, and not honestly looking at the story arc
                and literary parallels as Carrier does.
            </p>
            <p>
                Carrier doesn’t give a uniform score to all the Gospels. He gives Mark a 15 and Matthew a 19. I would give a few points less, but the general ballpark is correct, and there is no dispute that the general ballpark is correct.
            </p>
            <p>
                His claim is infuriatingly moderate, he doesn’t claim from this parallel that Jesus is a fiction in any way shape or form, this is simply a starting point, to say how skeptical he should be of historicity COMING IN, before
                looking at any direct evidence. He states that skepticism as an initial probability of 1 in 3 for historicity. This is not a manipulation or dishonesty, it is bending over backwards to be fair to historicists.
            </p>
            <p>
                He certainly has not dishonestly manipulate anything at all, he simply stated the criteria in a way that is consistent with his biases, and in the way he interpreted them. He doesn’t need to be verbatim accurate to Raglan to
                be accurate to the spirit of it. That’s not how literary comparisons work.
            </p>
            <p>
                No matter how you state the case, Jesus ranks high on the Raglan criteria, higher than historical figures generally do, simply by virtue of being a virgin birth, leaving in childhood, coming back in adulthood to assume his
                ministry and messiah role, dying on a hill, and all the mysterious stuff that surrounds his tomb. That puts him in the “historically suspicious” class, but Carrier only gives it a 1 in 3 a-priori suspicion, because he is
                being careful.
            </p>
            <p>A less generous observer like me would only have given Jesus a 1 in 20 prior on a good day. And I have no hostility to Christian religion, unlike Carrier.</p>
            <hr />
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>Carrier isn’t arguing that histories dispute Jesus’s existence. He is arguing that they SHOULD. That’s a different statement, and he is right about it.</p>
            <hr />
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Carrier is absolutely right about the use of invalid methods in the case of Jesus, and in monotheistic religious history in general. The problem with history in this subfield is that the method used is to first make a rough
                picture of the past, from the sources available, and slowly modify it as evidence accumulates. The presumption is that the consistent narratives are fitting together because they are reporting historical events.
            </p>
            <p>
                The major issue with this procedure is that Jewish religious narratives are purposefully written to APPEAR AS HISTORY, because the Jewish God is the God of history. The God of Israel doesn’t live as myth within the
                narratives of the Jewish faith, this God inserts himself into history, by the telling of history in retrospect with God inserted throughout, performing miracles. The stories are made consistent by the teleological
                requirements of being consistent with each other and with the vision of God, not through being accurate to historical truth. All Jewish myths are written to sound like history, and this makes it easy to get fooled by such
                stories.
            </p>
            <p>
                When historians apply the same methods they use to determine the historicity of nonreligious figures like Socrates to the question of historicity of Moses, or of Abraham, they get fooled. They (probably) got fooled by King
                David, they certainly got fooled by Daniel, and the prepoderence of the evidence shows that they got fooled by Jesus.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                This category is of VERY LITTLE VALUE, Carrier doesn’t claim that it is of any significant value, this is why he only uses it for assigning a prior! A prior is not evidence, it is an honestly reported bias, it represents
                what you believe on general principles before you get evidence regarding the specific case.
            </p>
            <p>
                The notion of prior is: what probability should I expect just from general knowledge about such stories? There are characteristics of made-up tales, and the more of these characteristics you find, the more suspicious you
                should be that the tale is made up to start. This can change as evidence accumulates, and it is very easy to overcome even absurdly small priors with good evidence, ten reports which have a 1 in 10 probability overcome a
                billion-to-one prior.
            </p>
            <p>
                All he is saying there is that the higher you score on the Raglan scale, the more suspicious the character as a historical figure. He quantifies his suspicion of myth as 2 in 3 coming in, which is very generous for
                historicists. When I see such a cock and bull story, I give it 1 in 10 at best to be based on a real person, at best. Nearly always such hero characters are composites of enormous numbers of people.
            </p>
            <p>
                The statement is that when you see a story of a person with Raglan traits, your prior should be depressed, but Carrier doesn’t even say by a particularly large amount. So that “Moses” should come with a default ahistoricity
                assumption, because of the strange birth story, death story, exile story, while, say King David would be neutral prior because he lacks these traits. Carrier in effect gives Jesus a neutral prior 1 in 3 is close enough to 1
                in 2 that it makes no difference which you take.
            </p>
            <p>His argument is not about the prior, the prior he gives on Jesus is too generous. His argument is about lack of confirming evidence of historicity, and extremely powerful evidence for ahistoricity.</p>
            <p>
                Your scoring of Jesus on your web page is a farce. Jesus definitely fits the model to a tee, as he has a strange birth story, is whisked away, appears as an adult to teach, then is killed on a hill, and has a strange death
                story. This is the model that Carrier identifies as suspicious, and it IS suspicious! This is simply common sense. the argument you should have is over evidence, not over priors.
            </p>
            <hr />
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                This is YOUR dishonesty, not Carrier’s. Carrier doesn’t use this Raglan criterion for anything other than a prior, and he gives the weight as “1 in 3” for historicity, which is very conservative, and doesn’t depend on these
                stupid details. Even if you take the most conservative view of Raglan, Jesus still scores more than half of the points. Whether it’s 20 or 15.
            </p>
            <hr />
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                They are the same methods applied to a completely different class of source material. The source material about Jesus is not of the same nature as the source material about Alexander the Great, and Carrier analyzes it
                honestly and correctly. His book is a real masterpiece, it is probably the best book about ancient history ever written in modern times.
            </p>
            <hr />
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Carrier hasn’t duped himself. He made a very strong argument in his book, a very well argued case. The consensus is unfortunately all due to academic inertia, which is real, and the strongest case (by far) is for a mythical
                Jesus.
            </p>
            <p>That doesn’t mean that Carrier’s work will be accepted, as this is a political process. In order to have acceptance in academia, it is not enough to be right, you need to align the power-structures around you to agree.</p>
            <p>
                But fortunately, the members of the power structures die, and new people who already are familiar with your argument take their place, and then the idea wins out. It is unfortunate that this is the type of political
                resistance Carrier is facing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I speculate that seeing what the academics will do to his book might yet make a Christian out of Carrier. Christianity is not about the historical Jesus, it is about the suffering of the righteous when confronting power, and
                Carrier is the righteous one here.
            </p>
            <hr />
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                It only seems that way to you because you have been brought up with a default historicity assumption. This is why Carrier’s Baysian methodology is important, it can quantify the ad-hoccery. I agree with his conclusions, more
                or less, except I would prefer the “minimal hypothesis” to be the most minimal hypothesis, of a God-Christ encarnated as an anonymous human on Earth, rather than in the firmament, to avoid the issue of interpretation
                difficulties of words in Ascent of Isiah and Paul.
            </p>
            <p>
                The major reason it isn’t ad-hoc is because the risen Jesus experience is purely ethical/psychological and will not come correlated with any historical event. It is a stretch to associate this experience with the
                ressurection of a man directly, rather than the appearance of a God. In the timeline of the theology, it is associated with a God at first, and later with a man, as expected for a religion that identifies the God as
                sacrificing himself in the bodily form of an unidentified and irrelevant Messiah. The God-&gt;man path is more plausible theology than deification of a man, because Jewish theology just doesn’t deify people. The standard
                story doesn’t make Christianity resemble Judaism at the earliest point, and you can’t see the two fit together. In Carrier’s picture, Christianity is a natural outgrowth of Judaism, and this is consistent with the existence
                of Petrine Christians who have a different historical Jesus as mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s hard to explain why there is much less ad hoc in this, because your implict assumptions of historicity corrupt your objective reading. The discussion about mythicism is not exactly a year old, it’s 100 years old, and
                really if you count the debates in the early church, it’s 2000 years old. Besides, my copy of Carrier just arrived.
            </p>
            <hr />
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Carrier’s thesis is a little too strong— he could get by with an “Even more minimal mythicist” hypothesis: Jesus decended to Earth, became Messiah (anonymously), got crucified on Earth (anonymously), and Paul and Peter know
                this because of scripture and revelation from the risen Jesus (without either having ever known any flesh and blood Jesus).
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s an answer to “Where is the Messiah?” The standard answer is “He will come.” The Messianic answer is “He is this particular great person.” The Peter/Paul answer is “He came, but humbled himself to be an ORDINARY person,
                and got crucified in righteousness to cleanse sin and obsolete the Jerusalem sacrifice cult. Then he revealed himself spirtually from beyond to the Apostles, to say that it had been accomplished.” This answer makes sense
                without latching on to any specific historical person, and it is compatible with several competing theories of historical Jesus.
            </p>
            <p>
                This hypothesis does not require a reading of Ascention of Isiah as stopping Jesus at the firmament, and does not require any stretch regarding “Born of woman” “died”, “crucified”, etc, they can take their ordinary meaning.
                It is otherwise identical to Carrier’s thesis, in interpreting “Brother of the Lord” as Christian without a direct vision of risen Christ, “Apostle” as Christian with a direct vision of the risen Christ, and again, has no
                need for a historical Jesus.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is more minimal, in the sense that all of Carrier’s argument support this interpretation as well. It ALSO is more minimal in that it is very easy to see how people would later embellish this with stories of Christ’s
                sojourn on Earth, without bad faith, based on parable, experience, and some incidental testimony.
            </p>
            <p>
                One reason to believe that a Carrier type mythical Jesus (or the even more minimal mythical Jesus described above) is likely is that the experience of the visitation of the risen Jesus is a real psychological experience, it
                happens in people today, and it does not necessarily associate itself with any historical event. It is important to place the psychological experience as primary, the risen Jesus, not any random historical events that are
                completely irrelevant. It makes better theology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Carrier’s argument is maintained with this hypothesis, only the very few stretched interpretations of Ascention of Isiah and Paul’s Epistles are removed. It’s basically identical to Carrier otherwise. I should add that
                Carrier’s case is made stronger when you consider that in his interpretation, 1 Peter can be an authentic Epistle of Peter, this is extra evidence.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                To add to this there are many reasons why something embarassing could appear. For example, Christians in Hebrew are called “Notzrim” (Nazoreans), which could come from the Hebrew root “Notzar”, meaning “formed” or
                “manufactured” in Carrier’s sense.
            </p>
            <p>
                When making his mythical account, Mark places Jesus in Nazareth to give a fake historical etymology for “Nazoreans”. Then people say “The Messiah is from Bethleham!”, embarassment, and Matthew fixes this. The embarassment
                would be not from history, it would come from reconciling different sources of myth.
            </p>
            <hr />
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>The claim is not extraordinary, because the Gospels are late, and talk in parables. There are two components to Christ:</p>
            <p>1. Direct experience of the risen Christ talking to you</p>
            <p>2. Indirect historical testimony of a historical Christ in the gospels.</p>
            <p>
                Number 1 definitely exists, as I have had this happen to me (and I have never even been a Christian!), many Christians report this experience both at the time of Paul and later and even today, and it is a completely
                reproducible psychological effect, which one can induce rather reliably in normal people.
            </p>
            <p>Number 2, the historical Jesus, serves as a story which induces experience 1 in many people, and also as a proselyzing tool independent of experience.</p>
            <p>One has to ask “Did 2 come first? Or did 1 come first?” In other words, is the historical Jesus an exegesis of the risen Jesus, or is the risen Jesus a fossil of the historical Jesus.</p>
            <p>
                Both hypotheses seem relatively equally probable at first, but it helps to have had the experience. The spiritual experience doesn’t come with a name, and it is implausible that a person who has this experience would
                identify it with any Earthly person.
            </p>
            <p>
                The best hypothesis I think is a slight modification of Carrier’s thesis— the mythical Jesus took on a body of Davidian lineage, descended to Earth, not the firmament (outer space), but he was crucified anonymously, without
                Peter or anyone else claiming to know him, or having any teaching. He was one of the anonymous thousands the Romans crucified in the past, and it doesn’t matter at all who he was, because when he got crucified, his blood
                redeemed humanity. It could happen in outer space too, of course, but the reading of Ascention of Isiah I think is somewhat more supportive of an Earthly decent (but nobody knows about it).
            </p>
            <p>
                This idea produces a completely anonymous messiah. His name, manner of death, tribulations, are all taken from scriptures. Then different people attached whatever stories they wanted, a Rufus comes along and says his father
                carried the cross (like anyone would fact check), etc. It wouldn’t even be false, as nobody knows who Jesus is, as he is anonymous by design.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then the gospels codify this. It’s exactly what Carrier argues, except without the unnecessary over-specificity of assuming that Christ only decended to the firmanent. He could have also descended to Earth, anonymously,
                without identifying himself as a messiah. Or not. It doesn’t matter which for the experience or the religion. Leaving the individual figure unspecified makes the religion more plausible.
            </p>
            <p>
                The issue with the “argument from embarassment” is that sometimes you can have embarassment for a reason that has nothing to do with the reason you think it is there. For example, in Hebrew, Christians are called “Notzrim”,
                which could mean “from Nazareth”, or “formation-people” (the root “notzar” means formed in Carrier’s sense). If you have a community of “Notzrim”, people might assume they are talking about Natzereth, just from fake
                etymology, and then Mark would place the historical Jesus there just because it sounds like “Notzar”. Then there comes the embarassment about the Bethleham birth prophecy, requiring the story of the nativity, etc, etc.
                Nothing to do with history, but with the development of myth.

                This is not just about history, it is also a history of religion, about which ideas led to which ideas. I just argue that it makes a better more sophisticated, more plausible, theology, that makes for the first time complete
                continuity between early Christian and Jewish theology, so that you can see the two fit together at the earliest point. The traditional story does not have any fit between early Christian and early Jewish thinking, as the
                central tenet— deification of a human teacher, is itself a rift of the worst sort. It is hard to see how such a rift could occur.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the current historical view, Christianity is a radical break from Judaism, which announces itself with the arrival of a special historical person, who is gradually deified upon death. This process is simply incompatible
                with Judaism, and it strains credulity to assume that Jews began this process.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result of historical investigation predicated on the unassailable idea of a historical Jesus, whatever the outcome, is an unwitting apologia for a supernatural sort of religion, because the idea that a human was deified
                immediately upon death suggests to gullible people that supernatual events actually occured, because the deification process starting from a historical person is implausible otherwise. This historical argument is used by
                apologists today, and it was clearly a useful argument for early Church founders, which is why they insisted on a historical interpretation after a certain time had passed.
            </p>
            <p>Modern people know that Supernatual events simply do not occur, and that informs the historical debate. It changes your priors, and it allows you to see the natural hypothesis is Carrier’s.</p>
            <p>
                Jesus predicted the dawn of the Kingdom of God in his lifetime, but what you must see is that for a Christian believer, this is not at all uncomfortable. He was spot on, as the Church itself and the body of Christ are the
                arrival of the kingdom of God in the Earthly realm. Once the mind-meld is there, and converts begin to appear, the eventual rise of the Church is preordained, and the end of ancient slavery, and the transformation of Rome,
                etc.

            <p>The picture of the history of Christianity which emerges if you take Carrier’s mythicism seriously has a hidden theological merit.</p>
            <p>
                Within Judaism, divine beings are never human. It would be an unthinkable blasphemy in 30AD to worship any ordinary human being as taking precedence over the laws of God. Still, it is clear from the Epistles that Paul has
                visions of a transcendent Christ enjoining him to make doctrinal modifications to Mosaic law, and that Peter, James etc, the other Apostles mentioned by Paul, also have transcendent visions of Christ, and also feel compelled
                to modify mosaic law. James is martyred and says “forgive them father, for they know not what they do”, the stoning of Stephen converts Paul by a direct spiritual experience that sounds completely authentic. These
                experiences are clearly the same type of religious experiences one personally encounters today, and these early Apostles are clearly acting in a deliberate way, found by consulting their spirit, and using their vision of
                Jesus-as-messiah as a divine source of courage and faith in martyrdom, as an intermediate between a distant abstract God and flawed imperfect man, and as a direct source of guidance for the evolution of the doctrine of the
                church.
            </p>
            <p>
                The historical interpretation of Christianity makes this transcendent spiritual Christ number two, lieutenant to a supposedly more authentic human Christ. But the risen Christ has never been second in the experience of any
                Christians, not these Apostles, and not to Christians today. The direct experience of Jesus visiting you as a friend, this is the main religious epiphany. The phenomenon actually happens, and it does not have an precise
                exact analog in Judaism, where overwhelming personal revelation is not typically asked for, and where collective unity is achieved through long unilluminating debate about traditional texts, not through transcendental
                attempts to form a weird direct mind-meld between all the practitioners.
            </p>
            <p>
                It seems that there is little doubt that Paul, Philemon, James and Peter shared this mind-meld, and from the Eucharist, that they believed themselves and others like them to constitute the earthly body of Christ, much as
                modern Christians do. This communal body of Christ, the collective body of Jesus in the congregation, is a completely different corporeal form than the ordinary human Christ of historicity research, and it has no direct
                relation to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given the authenticity of this experience of Paul and the other Apostles, it is difficult to see how this process could start within a Jewish community as a way to remember the activity of a flesh and blood crucified
                teacher. This implausibility isn’t apparent when you take the Gospels as historical narrative, because in the Gospels, Jesus performs supernatural feats, which obviously would be persuasive. While these stories are a
                profound exegesis for the revelation of a Christian mystical experience, they are impossible scientifically. So how is it more likely that these stories came to be? As an illustration of a true experience of revelation of
                the a personally felt resurrection? Or as mangled anecdotes of a historical teacher? For a person with any scientific sense, these are the only two options available.
            </p>
            <p>
                Absent the supernatural stuff, I personally find it next to impossible to see how a group of Jews would convert a mundane but saintly human into the martyr manifestation of God. It stops vexing theologically if you believe
                that the phenomenon of the risen Christ, the thing we know is real, comes first, while the human figure comes as exegesis. This makes the events one can be sure of by evidence and testimony primary. The corporeal
                manifestation described in the Gospels are written to produce and illustrate this experience, shared by the earliest practitioners. These are not the main event.
            </p>
            <p>
                To discover the possibility of this type of experience, and to communicate it to others reliably, requires genius theologians who meditated long and hard about the nature of ethics, and the relation of man and God. The
                historical view mostly puts all the genius on the back of one historical person, while the rest is an accident of bad circumstance.
            </p>
            <p>
                But there is a relatively plausible path to this point of view as an offshoot of traditional Judaism, which starts just by asking the legitimate question: “What properties would a Messiah need to right the wrongs of the
                world?” If you accept the concept of Messiah, and you know anything about the world at all, you would naturally reject any answers which give this end-times messiah corporeal form as a human being doing natural works. The
                reasonable conclusion (also shared by messianic Jews) is that such a messiah is a spiritual entity with person-like attributes, born of woman, etc, which can be thought of in every way as a person, except without inhabiting
                the world of persons, at least not until the world-to-come of the indefinite future. This is a somehow larger entity, which in Christianity binds the community together. This vision would not work with a historical person
                there to personify the collective entity, because Jews don’t make Gods out of people. But once your collective God has the attributes of a person, it’s easy enough to make a person out of a this figure, by collecting the
                stories that emerge.
            </p>
            <p>
                This origin story makes the stories of the human Christ a byproduct of the verifiable phenomenon of the spiritual revelations. The story of humilty, and crucifiction, and oppression, all the sermons and parables, these don’t
                require a single flesh and blood person to realize them, as they are naturally formed from the tribulations of the early Apostles, who formed the corporeal body right from the start. Their actions are even more commendable
                when they come without an idealized human precedent, when they form this human precedent in their mind-meld collectively, by imperfect human flawed actions of self-sacrifice.
            </p>
            <p>
                The issue with the claim of “solid historical evidence” for an individual named Jesus is that it isn’t solid at all, once you understand the spiritual epiphany of Christianty, and once you understand the living body of
                Christ, the human body of Christ is secondary, and if taken too literally, it seems somewhat disrespectful of the actual worldly communal entity people call “the body of Christ”.
            </p>
            <p>
                The spiritual Christ is more than powerful enough to write his own story in the hands of his followers without necessarily using a corporeal body. The followers harmonize their stories in good faith, and would not consider
                their own stories of Christ as falsifications, as they are not writing history. Since the collective work is the main teaching of Christian doctrine, not the corporeal story, Carrier doesn’t seem to be doing any harm to the
                message, as the message works even with no necessary connection to history.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a sense then, it is not clear that the historical Christ is even desirable. I see it as somewhat cheapening the actual spiritual experience. Nobody experiences a urinating Christ, or a baby Christ, Christ picking eye-snot
                out of the side of his nose. The historical view is in essence claiming that Christianity emerged as a sort of spiritual accident, like religious version of pennicillin. A historical leader was executed, people thought they
                saw his ghost, next thing you know, millions of people are transformed. This is not a plausible origin story, although, hey, you never know, history is strange. I don’t view Christianity as an accidental discovery.

                Socialism has nothing to do with lack of competition. People always compete. Even in the USSR, people competed to get into a good program, or to do well in school, or in chess, or to make more money (at least in the early
                days with large amounts of incentive pay). Lack of competition is what happens with monopoly capitalism.

                Socialism’s failures have never come from the insipid things right wingers say about it. They come because people weren’t able to innovate. The type of socialism Sanders advocates has no impact on innovation (at least, no

                I lived in Ithaca NY, and people there just printed their own money (the Ithaca “hour”, nominally $10). This currency is only viable in Ithaca, it is backed by absolutely nothing, and yet, it allowed people who are
                underemployed to make a few extra hours on the side, and then transact this in the local economy to buy farm products at the local stores that accept the local currency. This enhances the local economy by the percentage of
                hour transactions, and it is perfectly legal, and it made a lot of sense, as the central NY economy is chronically depressed and municipalities can’t control monetary policy usually.

                The analog in Greece is an obvious solution, and it would work to end the unemployment crisis. It would restore the industrial output, and allow pensioners dignity. It is also not something that needs to be confined to
                Greece, but towns within Greece, or for that matter, depressed towns in Germany, can do the same thing. It is a shame that currency is thought of as something that is centrally control. Central control is not the solution to
                problems, it produces larger problems, because the central committee can’t listen to a small town.

                The 19th century quotes are equally insane, they are made up wholecloth. I’ll ask you to consider: do you really believe that any people would accept a religion founded on such evil thinking? It is absurd! Any religion based

                While I am not a religious Jew, I do understand the philosophy of religious Jews, and it is not a philosophy of racial or ethnic supremacy. The “chosen people” thing means that the religious Jews have a collective mission to
                preserve the ancient language and texts of Judaism, so as to properly preserve the tradition of monotheism and spread it to other people. That’s the entire extent of it. It has nothing to do with racial superiority, or race
                hatred, or ethnic bigotry, nor putting Jews in powerful positions anywhere. It has to do with the duty to recite some Hebrew text, and teach it to children, and make sure it doesn’t disappear.

                Dude, you are totally sick in the head. Jews are not a herd of like-minded people imposing their collective will by ingenious behind-the-scenes string-pulling. It’s not like I agree with my relatives, nor do they agree with
                each other, nor do any of the Jews get orders from the higher-ups in the plot, whoever they might be. It’s hard to explain to you because you obviously don’t know any Jews, and promote a crazy implanted theory born of some
                crazy propaganda.

                Do you really need to believe in a small minority of evil people behind the scenes to explain why the world is corrupt? There is no mystery in that. You don’t need a small group of evil people leading and pulling strings to
                make an evil system, That happens naturally, whenever people do what is most convenient. How many Jews were pulling strings in 1933-45 Germany? or in Pol Pot’s Cambodia? Evil is something that happens when people go along
                with their narrow self-interest, ignoring their responsibility to the collective well being of humanity. That’s a distinctly Jewish concept of monotheistic justice, compassion, you might have heard of it, because the
                Christians borrowed that aspect of the philosophy.

                The left-leaning polling of US Jews is consistent with their voting, their party registration, and their fundraising aims. It is also consistent with me talking to Jews in New York, as they tend to be on the left, although
                not as far as one would hope, and not often on questions regarding Israel. Jews are not hiding anything from you, little child. They are not an oppressor class, they don’t go around distorting polls for some nefarious aims,
                and they are not particularly highly represented among the old-money classes, that’s all Anglo Saxon Protestants. The richest Jews support the right for the same reason as rich people of any ethnicity support the right, it
                is good for their pocketbook.

                Regarding your preposterous reading of The Talmud, you are quoting a document written around 2nd century AD, which hardly any Jew is familiar with, except religious scholars. You might as well cite the Council of Nicea to
                condemn John F. Kennedy. But I can explain the Talmudic insistence on separatism: at the time, “Gentile” didn’t mean “Christian” or “Muslim”, or any sort of monotheist. It usually meant a person who worshiped a gigantic
                lobster that asked you to sacrifice your children in its claws. These pre-monotheistic traditions justified mass murder, mass slavery, genocide, you name it, incredible oppression, and the Jewish religion, like the Christian
                religion later, distinguished itself by instituting liberty from generational servitude and protection of human life. Christians make similar claims regarding their relation to the Roman pagan order, they are required to
                resist it until it is destroyed. The Jewish religious injunctions of that era likewise treat the surrounding culture as something hideous to be resisted, because the presumption is that it is not an ethical order. When you
                are in an evil culture, it was decided that it is ok to hide, and to lie about your Jewishness, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea that these ancient religious injunctions, written in 2nd century Babylon, somehow make a Jewish person today consider Christians or Hindus or Buddhists non-ethical beings is absolutely preposterous. Jews and
                Christians in the US have constant interfaith dialogue, and there is very little that separates fundamentalist Christians from fundamentalist Jews, they are both fundamentalists first and modern people second. They both hate
                science to an equal degree, and they both have insane outdated strictures to a nearly equal degree. The lessons of monotheism are 2000 years old, and have percolated all over the world. There is hardly any person today who
                doesn’t have some inkling of what it means to follow a universal ethics, and it is a mental handicap to insist that Jews treat people around them as inferior beings.

                Jews in Israel oppress Palestinians for the same reason Apartheid South African whites oppressed South African blacks. It’s because they are living on colonized land, and they displaced a large number of native inhabitants.

                The “eradication of the Zionist disease” also has nothing to do with the US, a version of this process is something slowly going on in Israel. It isn’t going to buy you anything in the US, because the US is not dominated by
                Jews, except in your unhinged imagination. “Banksterism” is a word you invented, so as to identify the evil, then attach it to Jews somehow. An easier “ism” to attach to Jews, considering historical numbers, is “socialism”.
                I guarantee you that the number of Jewish socialists and communists exceeds by orders of magnitude the number of Jewish “Banksters”, and these camps are entirely locked in mortal combat for most of the 20th century.

                was possible when I was a child, considering how bad it was already back then. But to lump Jews with Israel’s actions is like lumping Irish Americans with the Gerry Adams. Sure, an Irish person might be statistically more

                The proof was perfectly fine, because it came with heuristic estimates for success which guaranteed that the line of attack would work with a complicated enough discharging notion. The paper by Appel and Haken was perfectly
                fine, and the mistake in programming was trivial, it didn’t affect anything at all in the method or conclusion, and it is possible that there will be a more conceptual proof showing a successful discharging algorithm exists
                without exhibiting it explicitly, although why would anyone bother, when you can exhibit it explicitly, I don’t know.

                It isn’t clear Columbus was using math. I’m guessing as to his intuition, but he probably knew about the trade wind, from experience at sea, and estimated the location where the wind circle closes was another land mass, and
                assumed it is Asia. He might have gotten the estimate to distance to land from another mariner, and then used the known distance to China to complete the circumference. He had knowledge of the Atlantic, and the Atlantic
                currents can be used to infer the existence of a gigantic land mass in the Americas even when you have never been there, analogous to the way the islanders in the pacific used the patterns of reflected waves to find small
                islands in the Pacific, but much more difficult because you need to use global currents and wind patterns. Somebody noticed, and it probably wasn’t Columbus personally.

                There are errors all the time, their resolution is usually a famous theorem. For example, Cauchy’s proof that the limit of continuous functions is continuous produced the notion of uniform continuity. The most significant
                such error is relatively recent— the attempt by Frege to produce a set theory using pure predicates, which was shown to be false by Russell with his paradox, and resolved with the theory of types. The reason older examples
                are hard to come by is because logic didn’t exist until around 1900, so any earlier example was done using intuition, and could be made precise in many different ways. The true mistakes don’t show up until the logic is
                clear.

                It is difficult to say, because no evidence was shown. Not in public, not in the trial. The lawyer consciously decided to admit guilt to save his life, so that the family can prove innocence later, when the political
                atmosphere shifts. The lawyer failed to save his life, it was a stupid move. On appeal, it is impossible to introduce new evidence, this means he will never get a review of the mountain of fabricated hearsay that was used
                against him.
            </p>
            <p>
                What was presented in public was all hearsay. People claimed that there is a video of him laying a bomb, this video does not exist. It was attested to exist by anonymous people lyingly commenting in public. There is no
                picture of him laying down a bomb. People claimed he killed a policeman, but there is no actual evidence of his involvement in the murder, the closest witness to this was killed by friendly fire (i.e. murdered) during the
                “shootout” at the boat. The shootout itself was not a shootout, as independent citizen video shows— only one side was armed, and the brothers on the boat were yelling that they didn’t do it. Both policemen were murdered
                deliberately by perpetrators, so as to produce police-hatred of Tsarnaevs.
            </p>
            <p>
                On 4chan, and elsewhere, people aggregated citizen pictures of the crime, and show Tsarnaev’s backpack, and it doesn’t match the blown-up backpack, which contained the bomb. There are people with backpacks there, these
                people are mercenary contractors of the blackwater type, and they are still not identified, nor have they been publically investigated. These are the guilty parties on the ground. Their boss in Homeland Security is the
                guilty party overall.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was a drill of some sort going on, similar “bomb in backpack” drills had been planned for the period by Homeland Security, and although this drill was scheduled for a few months later, the day of the marathon,
                witnesses heard anouncements regarding the drill. A drill is a simple way of making a false-flag— because you can easily get people to make a bomb for you, and you can get other people to plant a bomb for you, neither of
                whom think they have anything to do with the actual events, but rather that it’s a strange coincidence— just as they were planting fake bombs, a “real terrorist” happened to be planting real bombs! What a coincidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fellow Tsarnaev is not at all a religious fanatic (not that I have even seen a religious fanatic of this type in real life). He is a rather ordinary boring student who clearly had no idea he was accused in the bombing
                until he was announced to be a suspect three days later (and then reasonably ran away!) He was going to classes, joking with his friends, etc. His behavior on the day is absurd.
            </p>
            <p>
                The government has claimed that he wrote a confession in the boat, it is absurd. They have claimed wild stories of him running over his brother, when it is clear from the autopsy and the video of the scene that the brother
                was murdered in cold blood. He has been held in torturous conditions, his relatives and friends have been terrorized and murdered.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no chance in hell that he is guilty. He needs to be pardoned and released immediately and the folks in homeland security in Boston need to be investigated, one by one. It won’t be pleasant, but it is better than
                executing an innocent man to protect a bunch of official criminals.

                Anything established for a long time always comes along with bad arguments for why it must be so and no other way. The bad arguments don’t necessarily imply that the conclusion is wrong, only that people forget why the thing
                was put there in the first place. That’s natural, because the only person who needs to know this stuff is the one who is trying to overthrow it. That’s not just true regarding capitalism, it was true of Euclidean geometry
                and Newtonian mechanics. There were a million arguments in the 19th century about why Euclidean geometry is a-priori necessary, they were wrong, but that doesn’t mean Euclid’s geometry doesn’t work to describe our world to
                first approximation, and you need to know Euclid’s geometry to figure out Minkowski’s geometry.
            </p>
            <p>
                The authentic justification for capitalism is that you are looking for an evolutionary method, independent of human political judgement, for selecting which ventures are to be kept and which are to be thrown out. If the
                judgement is entirely political, like in pre-capitalist Europe, then certain things would never get developed— for example, try to persuade any organization which runs by majority vote to publish a book of gay pornography.
            </p>
            <p>
                This happens with more substantial things too. In the 1970s, you couldn’t get any large corporation to produce a home computer, so a new company had to be started using private capital. In the 1980s, you couldn’t persuade
                large airlines to cut costs, or big manufacturers like Gillette, so you had hostile takeovers and small competitors do it for you. In the 1990s, you couldn’t get AT&amp;T to modernize for the internet, so you made a scheme
                where the lines were shared among competitors, and let a thousand telecom companies start up. The same with internet business. Private ownership allows someone to continue to do something as long as they have customers,
                whether the majority thinks it is a good idea or not. Then the decisions about which entities survive and which entities die is made in a distributed fasion, using binding market choices that literally cost you to make. This
                evolutionary advantage is enormous, because it means that you don’t make the economic decisions based on political judgement of heirarchies of people, but based on purchasing choices of small entities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The owner class is just an unfortunate consequence, because private ownership is what defines the boundaries of the competing entities. The owner is the person who controls this little fiefdom. By taxing and anti-trust, you
                try to minimize the size of the owners, but you really can’t do it very well. Ultimately, the owner is not important, you could usually replace the owner with a scarecrow, it wouldn’t make any difference, as long as the
                entity boundaries were well defined, and decisions were made internally by a rational process. But it is the owner class that maintains the system, because they get the most obvious advantage from this. The owner is just the
                natural person who blocks one entity from bleeding into another by gradual takeover, the owner keeps the venture distinctive by dictatorially deciding what goes in and what stays out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Allowing evolutionary development is extremely important, and it is the main justfication for capitalism. It was the reason that it replaced Feudal economies, because the capitalist economies could concentrate capital into
                new ventures and very quickly expand to new shores, etc, etc. So if you are looking for a replacement, you need an evolutionary replacement which allows ventures to start and fail without oversight. The failures of
                replacements have been due to the lack of evolutionary advance, because there is not enough diversity in the economy when the ventures are not finely divided and independent.

            <p>I guess I am cold hearted. I am more interested in accurate numbers, not in human insanity. I suppose the human reason is that you can’t improve things without knowing exactly what happened first.</p>
            <p>
                Also, however, because of what it reveals about academics and the media, along the lines explained by Chomsky. They manipulate numbers, structurally, whenever there is pressure to do so. Some atrocities are reported
                accurately, like the Armenian genocide, or the Holocaust, or the Khmer Rouge insanity. Others, like the Tasmanian genocide, or the massacres in East Timor, or the disappearances in South America, are papered over. Yet
                others, like the Stalin crimes, or Mao’s three-year famine and cultural revolution, are inflated beyond all recognition.

            <p>
                In this case, the pressure to lie was always high, despite their being no need, because communism is terrible without lying. People had been lying about Marxists for a century, dating back to the Paris Commune and Marx’s
                time. This is extremely problematic, it means you can’t trust anything you read in the Western press, at least not without tedious double-checking yourself, because you know the owner of whatever it is you are reading for
                sure doesn’t like Marxists, as otherwise he would likely not own anything. Whether it’s Hearst making up nonsense, or others writing as if the Soviet Union was built up by slave labor.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way the labor system in the USSR worked from the time of the second Soviet constitution (the 1930s Stalin constitution) was that wages were set top down, but otherwise people were relatively free to change jobs. Some
                wily people in fact exploited the rather cushy job-training period to switch jobs often, some every six months. This was frowned upon, but you couldn’t punish it, because the system needed flexible labor. The worker wages
                were set by a precise law of supply and demand, the party raised wages wherever they needed more workers, and reduced wages where the supply was too high, very precisely getting exactly the number workers they needed without
                having to tell anyone where to work, or when to switch jobs. This method produced what I think could be best described as an ideal frictionless labor market, although the Soviets, being hostile to markets, wouldn’t describe
                it that way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wages were NOT equal in the Soviet Union, not at all. Highly sought professions, like precision machinist, or theoretical physicist, made higher wage. The manufacturing wages were supplemented in the 30s,40s,50s by “peice
                work”, meaning you would get a baseline salary based on meeting a (low) quota plus a hefty bonus according to your extra productivity beyond quota, with the bonus accounting for 60-80% of the salary in the Stalin era,
                depending on how many hours of labor you were willing to put in. An extremely good worker could make 3-4 times an average worker by working overtime and making more ‘pieces’. This system, at least in peacetime, led to
                reporting problems, and the paperwork was terrible, so it was scrapped to a more uniform thing with higher quotas and lower bonuses in the Khruschev reforms. The paperwork was reduced, but productivity also slackened then.
            </p>
            <p>
                The manager salaries were determined differently— you would get paid as a manager by how many workers you could attract and keep. Managers were relatively low paid compared to workers, and they were always sweating that
                their workers would leave, and they would fail to meet their manager quota and have to change jobs. So they had to be nice to the workers. The workers were relatively powerful, you could complain about the manager to a
                higher up, you could suggest new improvements and you would be listened to (as long as you didn’t criticize the system itself), and this was the way in which Soviet heavy industry was built. This sector was competitive with
                the West from the beginning, it was actually somewhat better than the West in heavy armaments and steel, as attested by the miraculous productivity in the second world war.
            </p>
            <p>
                That was the system. It was reported in the West to be a form of slave labor camp for the entire population, which is a ridiculous invention. It just didn’t have a high-paid owner class, everything was directed by
                functionaries.
            </p>
            <p>
                This type of lying is why communists in the 1940s didn’t believe the (very real) reports of atrocities under communism, because they knew the bourgeoise press lies about communism all the time. So leftist needed confirmation
                about the atrocities from Russian or communist sources, which was impossible, because they either clueless about it, or herd-mind loyal to Stalin, or so horrified by capitalism that they figured anything else must be better,
                or else they were scared to talk! Eventually, Khruschev had the secret speech, and a more or less free press was restored in the USSR for a few years, and in the era when it had free speech, in the early 1960s and in the
                1980s, the Soviet press was at least as honest as the Western press, and more interesting to read (at least for me), because it had no capitalist bias and no ads. But then, of course, you get heavy censorship again after
                1968. So, all in all, excluding a few years in the 1960s and 1980s, it was vastly inferior to the New York Times (at least as it was back then— today the NYT is a joke).
            </p>
            <p>
                I think the press situation during the cold war was already unbearable. The communist press was unreliable because it was censored by the party, but the so-called free press in the West was also unreliable when reporting
                regarding communist countries. Precisely when you are comparing two systems and you need to know exactly what is going on, you get lied to. The internet fixes this for good, because you don’t have a barrier to speaking
                anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was heavy into Soviet history in the 1980s, because it was topical at the time, and, like every other kid in 1983, I would wake up in cold sweats dreaming I was dying in a total nuclear war. Also, knowing capitalism from
                the inside, one is curious to know what the heck they are doing exactly in the USSR to have no unemployment, no recessions, no year-to-year fluctuations in GDP, and kick-ass education. The unfortunate answer was “not too
                much worth emulating”.

                The main issue is that there were multiple military drills simulating multiple hijacking on the same morning as the attack. If you are simulating 9/11, and 9/11 happens at the same time, that’s not a coincindece. You’re
                responsible for it. It’s very easy to manipulate a set of drills simulating 9/11 into a fake attack, without anyone knowing what they are doing. They just do their job for the drill, and you change a few details so that they
                are pulling off a fake attack. The same pattern drill-&gt;attack occurs in all the other major terrorist attacks of the last decade, including the London bombing, the Oslo attack, the Madrid bombing, and so on and so on. You
                can read about the drills in mainstream sources, and you can figure out how to pull off 9/11 without conspiracy just by sitting down and thinking.

                That’s right. No info anymore is accurate. You need to understand that the “stalin crimes” are composed of two pieces— the purges and political murders, and the collectivization famine. Both are real, but both have been
                subject to death-toll inflation in the 1990s, long after the events. The analysis of these crimes in the 1950s in Khruschev’s time was not far off the mark, as it was redone in the late 80s in the USSR, under Gorbachev (who
                personally suffered from the famine in the 1930s, and perhaps as a consequence, became a farming technical guy in the Politburo) and again after the fall of the USSR, using the open archives.
            </p>
            <p>
                The deaths from political murder and executions were on the order of a million people. This is extremely barbaric, comparable to the political murder under Hitler (not to the genoicide). It is about the worst degree of
                political murder you can imagine. But these million people are turned into 12 million or 20 million by adding all those who were arrested and released, or fired from the party in a purge. This is simply dishonest reporting,
                but it gets you press.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Ukraine estimates are the main atrocity, this is a terrible crime, and the midrange of the figures is likely accurate, just by nose. I place it at 2-5 million. It’s hard to know, you need to really sample starvation in
                the Ukraine. But the famine wasn’t confined to the Ukraine, but thankfully the famine ended in 1933, because the harvest was extremely good. But it could have lasted for years, like it did in China. It’s a collectivization
                famine, it happened more than once.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the collectivization famine also involved the dispossession of about 10-20 million small land-owners, the kulaks, whose land was confiscated, and who were forced onto collective farms. These people are victims of Stalin,
                but they weren’t killed. They are just added to the death toll by irresponsible people, because it gives them attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                You need to ignore the secondary sources in this case, and focus on the actual documents relating to the two major events— the political murders and purges, the show-trials, and the famine in the 1930s. The “research” that
                people publish in the semi-popular press is worthless unfortunately, so you need look into it yourself. The way to see that it is definitely worthless is simply to ask a dozen Russians about their family history, to see the
                numbers who died from political repression, the numbers who died in WWII, and the numbers who were starved in famine. You get a fair estimate of the first two this way, but a bad estimate of the third, because famines are
                hard to poll, because the victims are often infants and the elderly, who are not properly accounted for in these narratives.

            <p>Chomsky is not omniscient, and his stance on the Khmer Rouge is understandable once you know how unreliable the Western press can be.</p>
            <p>
                The problem with the reports of atrocities in hard-left regimes is that they always come, whether there’s anything there to report or not. For example, you have reports of Tito’s Yugoslavian atrocities, executions, political
                murders, etc, in the 1990s, when it was fasionable to attack Yugoslavian socialism, and these reports were either referring either to 1944-46, when the communists were Partisans executing Nazi collaborators, or else to
                invented events. There were no significant atrocities at all in Yugoslavia in the postwar period, the worst things (which are still bad) were some temporary restrictions on free speech in the 1970s. Similarly, you had
                reports of press muzzling, reporter suppression, in the Chavez regime, and these were entirely invented. It was crazy to invent, because Venezuela was open the whole time and had a free press throughout, anyone could see
                what was happening online by going to Venezuelan press. So these accusations didn’t stick. But there were reports of oppression, tyranny, mobs of Chavez supporters rigging elections, businessmen thrown in jail, etc. The
                press in these cases is a stopped clock, it always reports human rights violations from the socialist left, whether they are real or imagined, and it never reports human rights violation from the fascist right.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the case of the Khmer Rouge, the stopped clock happened to be right, they even understated the atrocities in this case. Since Cambodia was completely closed, it was difficult to know what was going on with any standard of
                objectivity. Chomsky was skeptical of the reports until they were clear and confirmed, and I don’t think you can fault him for that too much, since he admitted he was wrong about this and changed his mind relatively quickly.
                He did not deny the atrocities once they were established with good evidence.

                Each person you survey has usually about order 100 people in their extended family, and these people know others, so you are actually sampling quite a few. If you ask a dozen people, you are actually pretty effectively
                sampling about 10,000 people, which is certainly enough for order of magnitude estimates with 100% confidence, which is why I am so confident, and you’re so busted, silly bird.
            </p>
            <p>
                The stories of severe repression, murder, disappearance, occur at the “distant acquaintance” level– meaning a second cousin of the grandfather had a colleague who disappeared. This is consistent with the estimates published
                by serious researchers, which show that on the order of 700,000 people were disappeared in the 1930s purges, with perhaps a comparable number in the 1920s and 1940s. It also reveals a level of mass terror that has hardly any
                precedent, as EVERYONE is terrified.
            </p>
            <p>
                The absurd nonsense you spout about “entire villages” being rounded up and killed, and then all their acquaintances killed, and the relatives of these acquaintances, is a mentally disturbed fantasy, and ignorant of the web
                of networks in society. Even if you exterminate whole villages, as in Poland in the 1942-1945, sampling STILL WORKS to tell you the magnitude of the crime, although it tends to underestimate it.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I also have interviewed enough (and read enough reports and documents) to know that you are full of it. There were no “death camps”, the people sent to prison were individuals, they were targeted by their local party
                boss. You have no idea what you are talking about, and I would prefer it if you didn’t lie online, as you will learn that it is pointless, as an ass like me can quickly mock you into oblivion, as Chomsky did to Harris.

                I DON’T READ ANYTHING, so I never cite sources. I am just telling you the truth about this stuff. The political repression under Stalin existed, and it had the casualty levels I gave you, in order of magnitude. The worst
                atrocity was the starvation in Ukraine in 1932, and this was due to the peasant uprising, and it lasted one year. But it was ultimately just another collectivization famine.
            </p>
            <p>
                I CATEGORICALLY DENY any holocaust in this instance. It was “just” the usual brutal communist repression, and the usual collectivization famine. The mass-death figures in the media are a hoax, and realizing that they were
                mostly a hoax, FDR recognized the Soviet Union in 1933. That doesn’t mean that the collectivization program was benign— it was terrible.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way to discover this stuff is FOR YOURSELF, by doing your own quick research. You just ask a dozen Russians and Ukranians about their family history, to get a sense both of the repression and the deaths, and compare to
                the baseline of their family deaths in WWII, and to the population of the areas. I did this for the Jewish holocaust too (amply confirming the usual story), and for Pol Pot, it’s not hard to do, but I didn’t do it myself (it
                would also confirm the official story). I am sorry, but getting past the mountain of bourgeoise invention in this case takes more effort than reading sources, it requires using your brain and verifying independently, to know
                who you can trust.
            </p>
            <p>I did this for myself, you can do it too, it’s not hard. Stalin and Mao’s holocausts are MADE UP LIES. Pol Pot’s is real (and Hitler). It’s simple.</p>
            <p>
                Mao’s mass-death figures are entirely due to the collectivization famine. These are also produced, like Stalin, by looking at population graphs, and extrapolating to the missing people. This method also reveals that 10
                million Americans were wiped out in the Great Depression, only to rematerialize as the baby boom. The reason that this doesn’t work well to estimate famine deaths (unless done carefully) is that hard times lead people to
                postpone having babies, leading to severe demographic drops.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Mao famine was especially severe, and millions of people suffered and died. But it is hard to give a good number, it is a collectivization famine, like Stalins. You find the best estimates of numbers by asking people
                from the affected area. If a statistical sample doesn’t support the story, the story is a LIE.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this case, there is a deliberate program of lying about Stalin since the 1930s and Mao since the 1960s. This is not necessary, because these dictatorships were atrocious without lying. It is also counterproductive, as
                these lies make people somehow think that there were no real crimes committed by these folks, and oh boy, were there.

                historians who covered this. The conclusions I gave above are mainstream in some historical sources. The survey you can also do yourself, and any conclusion which doesn’t match a random sampling of Russians and Ukrainians is
                a lie. People know their own family history independent of official history.

                The Abrahamic religions’ statements about the physical world are incorrect, but this is not their point. The point of these religions is to explain that it is possible to act in a way that is not in accordance with a narrow
                definition of self-interest, but in a way that is mindful of a larger community and it’s goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is clarified if you make it precise with the notions of superrationality, and the ordinals of mathematics. The concept of the Church-Kleene ordinal and the concept of superrational behavior explain that when you act you
                should act as if there was an all-knowing entity who knows what everyone wants and knows everything about everything, and that this entity then tells you what to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because the only way to have any clue of what this entity wants is to painstakingly reconstruct what the best behavior is in collectives, you need to look at history, and experience, and you need to summarize this thinking
                in texts. The religious texts just do the best job they could do at the time, given the political constraints around them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since we are having this conversation over wires, and since all of us have a scientific and mathematical maturity today that those people would salivate at, we can do better. But the main idea is not garbage, it’s just “act
                as if God is telling you what to do, where God is defined as a perfect logician who knows what everyone wants, has an idea of the collective goals of all the humans together and tells everyone else what to do too”. The basic
                law of the religious texts is that those who act this way have an advantage over very long time scales over those who don’t, and this prediction is historically true, and is a self-consistent justification of the idea.

                West. If you can’t even find such a person in your neighborhood, what threat do these people pose? It’s entirely a concocted threat. The only Jihadists in the sense presented by the Western media in the last decade and a

                This is why communists in the 1940s didn’t pay attention to the starvation in Ukraine. They were looking forward to the “glorious future”, and they figured that the suffering due to capitalism in the past and present
                justifies some suffering on the way to socialism in the future, where they assumed the suffering would be gone for good. They figured once collectivization is done, you never have to go through it again. It was a monstrously
                cold calculus regarding millions of human lives and a complete disregard for the practices of millions of independent farmers with knowledge and efficiency practices. But this callous attitude toward collective knowledge and
                tradition and toward human lives is shared by the colonialists. The earliest and best example of such a catastrophic preventable famine to my mind is the Irish famine, which was barely disguised ugly genocide done through
                pure laissez-faire.

            <p>
                I know you’re not doing this, but it’s not a good idea to justify an atrocity because others are doing comparable atrocities elsewhere. You know that’s the response you get when you try to fix the damnable lies about this
                stuff, that you are trying to minimize crimes, instead of honestly reporting.
            </p>
            <p>
                What’s damning about this is that while the worst atrocities were happening, people were flocking to communism! The Western left’s dissillusionment with communism came in the postwar years, when communism ossified into a
                bureaucratic form with no significant atrocity potential, aside from the horror of having to fill out twenty forms just to get your car fixed.

                This is what you find on google, unfortunately, due to a spate of lying literature from the late 1990s. I read about this extensively in the Gorbachev times, when the USSR was still around, and people were analyzing this to
                death a second time around. Gorbachev sufferered under famine. I claim no expertise, I simply looked at the academics, and asked a boatload of Russians and a few Ukrainians about their family histories so I could be
                absolutely sure of the scale of the crimes. There is fear of arrest in every family, arrests in many families I could sample (emigres), and deaths are rare, usually a distant distant relative.
            </p>
            <p>
                That immediately rules out a death toll of 20 million, let alone 60 million. The easy question to ask is “where did more of your family die, in WWII fighting (known casualites) or in Stalinist repression (unknown
                casualties)”. The answer is statistically representative even with a tiny sample, and it reveals the figures people throw around to be lies.
            </p>
            <p>You can read modern leftist academics to get reasonable accounts of this. The propaganda value of lying about Stalin is just too tempting to resist for anyone who wants to get into big media.</p>

                Sorry, that’s complete nonsense. There are not 12 million who were killed in gulags and reeducation camps, there are on the order of 1-3 million in Stalin’s time. The main number of victims is the Ukranian famine. This is
                known to anyone who looks at Soviet archives, it is just something that idiots lie about in the media, because saying bad things about Stalin is rewarded. Tut tut. One must not lie. The vast majority of those sent to the
                gulag were released after serving their sentence, this number includes 10s of millions of very bitter people. But they aren’t dead, their souls were just destroyed, and their livelihoods removed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, the kulaks in the ukraine had their property confiscated in the 1930s, and they were forced onto collective farms. They objected, some resisted, and those that resisted were killed. Lots of others died during the
                famine that emerged from the bad policy and perhaps the deiberate targeting of the rebellious regions for punishment by no-food. These policies are the worst atrocity in Stalin’s times, but the numbers are lied about again.
                For no reason, because the truth is horrible already. One must not lie.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can do a sampling estimate for all genocides, including, for example, Polish Jews, where the number of survivors is extremely small, and in actual reality whole villages were obliterated. If you sample a surviving Polish
                Jew and ask what fraction of their family survived, it’s on the order of 20-30%, and this is all survivor bias, the true number of those killed is 90%. This allows you to extrapolate that the Polish Jews were exterminated
                with a rough count.
            </p>
            <p>In the USSR, families were simply not targeted. There were good communists side by side with dissidents in many families. The USSR did not have a hereditary criterion, really.</p>
            <p>
                The place where the death toll under Stalin approaches 100% is among the original 1917 revolutionaries. If you sample these, you find that nearly all of them were killed in the waves of political murders before WWII. After
                WWII, the situation was better, but very few were left. In Khruschev times, these crimes were discussed, and they were rediscussed in Gorbachev times, and nearly all the analysis since then that you read in the West has been
                shameful invention.

                It’s not an interesting thought experiment, because the answer to this ludicrous thought experiment doesn’t change what policy should be. The policy needs to be “torture is always illegal, and always punished by the state”,
                just as the policy is “murder is always illegal, and always punished by the state”, even though if you were given a time machine and a gun, not many people would object to you going back in time and murdering a young Hitler.

                If you need to torture someone to save a billion people, you just break the goddamn law and do it, then go into hiding. I’m sure in this incredibly unlikely circumstance, which will never happen in a billion years, some
                fraction of the billion people you saved will protect you, and feed you and hide you. The law needs to be unambiguous that torture is always illegal, because it is never used to save people, it is used to terrorise
                dissidents and protesters into submitting to government power. It is also used to make patsies confess to crimes they didn’t commit, and provide false information to complete the story of nonexistent events that are
                necessary to put together a false narrative about history. All of these things are what torture is used for routinely, including after 9/11, where it was used to substantiate the hoaxed government report.

                If you believe these numbers, you are a dimwit. Ask a Russian or Ukrainian what fraction of their family died in Stalin’s time and you get the true figure. There were on the order of 1-3 million political murders during this
                time, and on the order of 10 million imprisonments and subsequent release. The toll from the collectivization famine in the Ukraine in 1932 is between 2-6 million, hard to be sure, because it’s a famine, the victims are
                often the elderly and young children, who are not counted well in official documents, but you can get a sampled estimate by asking Ukranians about their family history. Both figures have been lied about in preposterous ways
                in the literature, starting with Solzhenitsyn (who makes up 40 million, 60 million, 20 million, whatever) with the goal simply to make “Stalin is worse than Hitler” claims, which are ridiculous. The numbers from non-Leftist
                sources are not scholarly, they are simply anti-communist propaganda. Communism is bad enough that you don’t need to lie about it.

                Since God is a teleological notion, always referring to the future time when God’s will is made more explicitly manifest, the idea is that if the substitution sticks after a long open debate, then their own judgement is
                really God’s judgement, and they are substituting correctly. The problem is that then they tend to go back and make it sound like it was always this way in the original text, which is a disservice to the history, because it
                distorts the meaning originally given to the text, and doesn’t allow you to see the evolution of ideas over time. It’s the same in constitutional law, since the interpretation of the constitution is also teleological, as it
                was designed to be broad enough to accomodate future circumstances into the indefinite future. You can reinterpret a constitutional clause so that it is more consistent with the background of circumstances and
                interpretations that build up, but you need to also be aware that the founders might have had a different interpretation (and that doesn’t matter so much, as the social context was different, and their interpretation might
                have made sense in that context).

                This is certainly not true of the good ones, as they have additional guidance from their own moral intuitions and experience, and they use this “holy spirit” guidance explicitly to amend the interpretation of the texts. In
                Judaism, I heard it is actually considered a sin to read the text without the commentary and amended interpretations, it is considered a sort of blasphemy of literalism. Similarly in Catholicism. One of the heretical ideas
                in the reformation was that people should read the text of the bible without going to theology school for years and years, because they would read the plain meaning, and not the amended thelogical interpretation which
                includes the insights of all the people in the following 1500 years. The theological commentary is always informed by a person’s individual conscience, but the arguments themselves are not very good, because they have to hew
                to the idea that the original texts are infallible, so they need to work like a lawyer to amend the texts where they are wrong, as they often are, for example, about homosexuality, or the role of women, or the
                appropriateness of genocide, or respect for primitive art.

                large computable ordinal countdown terminates. The assumptions of well-foundedness of large computable ordinals is a justified (but theological) substitute for the otherwise unjustified assumption that some given axiomatic
                system (like ZFC) is consistent, and it allows you to prove all such statements as normal theorems, making only assumptions of a generally accepted kind about computable structures, namely that a given large computable (and
                therefore countable) ordinal is actually an ordinal. For a specific example, look at the proof that PA is consistent from the well-foundedness of epsilon-naught, which is a very simple ordinal, comparatively speaking.

                should be allowed to practice polygamy, or charge interest, or go off and do blasphemous art, and this is meaningful discourse. Their arguments, on the other hand, often consist in nitpicking interpretations of ancient

                The notion of God was identified by Cantor as the limit of all ordinals in the 1890s, this was the foundation of set theory, it was why set theory was important, and replaced the infinity of calculus and infinite series
                within mathematical practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cantor took the limit to mean uncountable ordinals, as he was enamored by a set theory that included the real numbers (powersets), since he discovered both ordinals and uncountability. But later analysis of logic through
                Godel and Skolem showed that the proper logical notion for a set theory is computable axiom systems in first order logic. The proper models for such theories are countable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Church, Turing, and Kleene through the 1940s analyzed ordinal structures and eventually identified the proper concept of “mathematical God” as the Church-Kleene ordinal. This was elucidated in Turing’s strangely
                underrecognized 1938 thesis and Church’s identification of the Church-Kleene ordinal, together with Kleene’s “O”, the naming system for ordinals that allows you to speak about ordinals approaching this ultimate complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Church-Kleene ordinal, when you count down from it, is sufficiently complex to prove any consistent computable theory is consistent, and resolve any well-defined mathematical question, i.e. one which can be phrased as
                the halting of a computer program, perhaps with an oracle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The relation to the ethical conception of God is through the proposition that superrational ethical systems can decide how one should behave as if an infinitely wise agent who knows everyone tells you what to do, and the
                decision procedure is well defined when you have a complete system of mathematics, which is provided by approaching the Church Kleene ordinal as closely as you can. Of course, you can’t reach it, but you can approximate it
                better and better using more sophisticated axioms of infinity, which produce theories whose proof-theoretic ordinal get closer to Church Kleene.
            </p>
            <p>There is no relation to supernatural conceptions of God, but these are basically considered obsolete even within standard religion by theologens since at least the middle ages.</p>

                “Anything you can state about one, you can state about the other” is correct, and “there is no difference between the statements” is also correct— the statements are contrapositives of each other. Only a lying twerp

            <p>class (not X) contains class (not blue)</p>
            <p>These are the statements with identical truth tables, you challenged moron. I have explained this about a dozen times.</p>
            <p>not-Earth contains not-blue</p>

            <p>
                Your claim regarding “solid blue” show you don’t understand the class attributes. Saying “Earth contains blue” does NOT mean that “Earth consists of oceans and land”, and has nothing to do with the solidness of color of the
                Earth, you idiot. What “Earth contains blue” REALLY means in this context is the nonsensical claim that the collection of the one thing “Earth” contains the collection of ALL BLUE THINGS, including every blue gas giant in
                the Andromeda galaxy. The collection “Earth” does not contain “the sky”, even though the sky is part of the Earth. It doesn’t contain “Krishna” either, even though all Hindus currently happen to live on the Earth. The formal
                statement about classes is very different from the idiotic meaning your mathematically untrained little brain gives to the informal statement.

                just a fact that you are obviously far too dim to appreciate. Must be tough with so little light up there.

                You pathetic sap, you are simply crazy. there is no “double negative” in the contrapositive. Double negative is something else altogether, where two nots cancel each other out, because they are applied to the same thing. In
                a contrapositive, the two negations are applied to separate things, and don’t cancel each other out. It’s not a simple example of a double negative.
            </p>
            <p>Specifically:</p>
            <p>“The Earth is not red” is a proposition. The contrapositive is “Not Earth contains class red”. Notice that there s only one negative in each statement. Nothing to cancel out.</p>
            <p>
                “The Earth is blue” contraposes into “Not Earth contains class not-blue”, and it is not a double negative either, despite your pathetically ignorant untrained intuition, because the two “nots” are acting on separate things.
            </p>
            <p>
                An actual example of a double negative is “The complement of the class not-Earth is blue”. This is a double negative equivalent to “The Earth is blue”. Double negatives are trivial in formal logic, because you can get rid of
                all pairs of consecutive nots. Contrapositive is less trivial, precisely because it is not a double negative. That’s the reason they gave it a separate name, you see.
            </p>
            <p>
                The contrapositive sentence converts a property of Earth into a property of Not-Earth. The Earth is in this class tells you that not earth contains this other class. It’s not the normal way you say “The Earth is blue”, but
                it’s completely logically equivalent. This is why it helps to study formal logic, because you can’t figure this stuff out just by blabbing ignorantly like you are trying to do. You have to use an organ called “the brain”,
                which organ, unfortunately, you are missing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The contrapositive of Earth properties give for each one a property of not-Earth. You can’t distinguish them formally from properties of Earth, you can’t say “these here are properties and these other statements are not
                properties” (or, rather, you can if you like being ARBITRARY, but hey, so far you don’t care about even seem to care about being correct, so maybe I shouldn’t presume). These statements contain the exact same content, except
                speaking about the complement. Moron

            <p>“Equally well” means that all statements are the same. You don’t consider one kind of statement special and the contrapositive different. none are special.</p>
            <p>Since you don’t understand, I see that, on the other hand, you must be a different kind of special.</p>
            <p>
                “No difference” does not exclude negating attributes and flipping arrows. It means the two statements, after the proper flipping of arrows, have exactly the same content.. It takes a really special person to misunderstand
                this obvious point.

                The claim I made is accurate. Anything you can state about “Earth” you can state about “not Earth”, using trivial and obvious inversion and flipping, which I showed you by example. Your retarded interpretation of this
                statement shows that you must have suffered a blow to the head. I never made the claim that you do a simple substitution, nor could I even conceive in my wildest fantasy that ANYONE would think this, considering how stupid
                it is. Guess I was assuming I wasn’t talking to the victim of blunt head trauma.

                As by now YOU VERY WELL KNOW, you insincere potted plant, “contained in” and “contains” are both properties of a class, one property is not distinguished as special over the other, so they are equally good— meaning neither
                kind of property is preferred over the other, and you can’t say “these containerships are properties of Earth” and “these other kinds of containership are properties of not-Earth”. Both containerships are equally well
                thought of as properties of either one, equivalently, because of the freedom in formal logic to negate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your examples are mentally retarded. “All mafiosi are sicilians” is reversed to “all non-sicilians are not mafiosi” as I have explained many times, and all these statements can be interpreted as properties of “mafiosi”,
                “sicilians”, “non-mafiosi”, and “non-sicilians” equally well. There is no distiniguished interpretation, nor any preference for a statement over its contrapositive.
            </p>
            <p>
                The contrapositive just complements all classes and flips one kind of containership to the other, and neither is distinguished. So there is no significance to Popper’s idiotic false intuitive distinction between
                “verification” and “falsification”, or for that matter, to any other intuitive distinction which hinges on an informal intuition that there is some sort of asymmetry between negated statements. The formal language simply
                doesn’t allow you to treat these asymmetrically, when you speak precisely, despite Popper’s brain-damage.
            </p>
            <p>
                I explained how to do the translation from a property of a class to the property of the complement precisely above, so that you can see that it is easily done. What I was saying is precisely correct, and your response is
                MENTALLY DEFECTIVE RHETORIC. Do you honestly think that any of your examples are confusing? Obviously not. You just want to sound like you aren’t as ignorant as you have unfortunately revealed yourself to be. That doesn’t
                work with formal mathematics, fortunately. You are just busted.

                The flipping of implication arrows in the logic description is a flip in the containership properties of the classes, which is completely insignificant, since either “contains” or “is contained in” are equally good
                properties of a class.

                “The Earth is blue” is a property of Earth.<br />
                “The Earth is not a gas giant” is also a property of Earth.<br />
                “The Earth in 1955 is a special case of Earth” is also a property of Earth.<br />
                “The Earth did not exist in 10,000,000,000 BC” is also a property of Earth
            </p>
            <p>The contrapositive statements in class language is:</p>
            <p>
                “Not-Earth is contained in the class not-blue”<br />
                “Not-Earth contains the class gas-giants”<br />
                “Not (Earth-in-1955) includes Not-Earth and is not the full universe”<br />
                “Not (Earth-in-10,000,000,000 BC) is the full universe”
            </p>
            <p>Every statement about Earth considered as a class can be converted trivially to the statement about the class not-Earth, as I explicitly did for you in the four examples. You can do it yourself now.</p>
            <p>
                The question of which way the containership relation goes is an idiotic red-herring you made up. All these statements are equally good properties of Earth (or not-Earth), as you can see explicitly in the examples, and the
                containership properties go every which way, depending on the sense of the statement.

            </p>
            <p>The statement “not Earth contains not blue” is most definitely a statement stating a property of “not Earth”, just as “not blue is included in not earth”. It is also COMPLETELY EQUIVALENTLY a statement about the Earth.</p>
            <p>Similarly,</p>
            <p>“The circumference of the Earth is 40,000 miles”</p>
            <p>is contrapositive equivalent to the statement</p>
            <p>“Not Earth includes all objects whose diameter is not 40,000 miles”</p>
            <p>Now it’s a statement about a property of the class “not Earth”.</p>

                “Earth is blue” is equivalent to “non-blue is non-Earth”. The statement about classes is that the set/class consisting of the single mathematical object “EARTH” in your mathematical model is included in the class of “blue
                things”.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is also the statement that the absolute complement of the class of “blue things”, i.e. the class of nonblue things, is included inside the class “non-Earth”, the absolute complement of the class “Earth” (every set is also
                a class).
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s the complete and proper translation of all statements by someone who knows rudimentary logic. Notice, any statement about Earth, you can translate into a statement about the class “non-Earth”. Notice that complements
                require talking about proper classes. Notice that everything I said is both precise and correct.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is assuming a model where the Earth is a mathematical object, so that you can talk about it as if it were a mathematical object. This is not the usual way people speak, but it is an acceptable way to speak, because it’s
                not like “the Earth can be considered as a mathematical object” is a statement with any bearing on the senses.

                Since you insisted on conflating propositions with objects. I took the charitable interpretation where THIS IS ALLOWED. You make a mathematical model of the Earth and everything in it, and consider the Earth as a
                mathematical object.
            </p>
            <p>If the surrounding mathematical universe is set theoretic, then, the EARTH in the model, is a set, and it’s complement is a CLASS.</p>
            <p>
                Then any statement you make about the mathematical object “EARTH” is equivalent to a statement about the class “NOT EARTH”. And these are both classes, but only one is a set. This is the only way to talk about statements and
                their negations in a way so as to pretend to be talking about objects.

                Of course not, little buddy. The contrapositives I gave were correct. P and Q are PROPOSITIONS, i.e. sentences, not things. So P cannot equal “Earth”, because “Earth” is not a proposition. It can equal “The Earth is blue”,
                or “rain is wet”.

                Once you have CLASSES, then you can have propositions as objects, each proposition is the class of sets that satisfy it. When you have SETS and mathematical objects, and you assume “all mathematical objects are sets”. Then
                you can speak about “Earth” as a set, a VERY UNNATURAL set, the set of “Earth” considered as a mathematical object.
            </p>
            <p>But now you can’t speak about “not Earth” as a set, because “not Earth” is not a set. The complement of a set in the universe is always a class.</p>

                So the proper symmetric way to treat “Earth” and “not Earth” as set-like things is to treat them both as proper classes. But it is still unnatural. The calculus of logic applies most naturally to propositions, to sentences.
                Class language just turns sentences with variables into nouns, the collection of objects for which the sentences becomes true.

                The CONCEPT of absolute complement exists, it is just INCONSISTENT and NONSENSICAL and REJECTED by set theorists since around 1900. The concept is not included in any modern set theory (you can enter “Naive set theory” in
                your search bar to read about this).
            </p>
            <p>
                To see why the concept of absolute set complement is formally inconsistent— consider the empty set, take it’s complement in the universe, and consider the ordinals which are inside this complement, find the limit of these
                ordinals, and add one. This ordinal is not in the complement (since it is bigger than all the ordinals in the compement), but it should be. Contradiction.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s just one of Cantor’s paradoxes. Another is “take the set of all subsets of the complement of the empty set”. This is larger in cardinality than the complement, but the complement supposedly includes all nonempty sets.
                This is another Cantor paradox.
            </p>
            <p>
                Knowing about these paradoxes, Cantor explicitly rejected considering the universe as a set, or taking complements of set in the universe. This advice was not appreciated by Frege and Boole, who wanted the laws of sets to
                mirror the laws of logic. Then Russell forced Frege to take Cantor’s objections seriously by stating the simplest formulation of this paradox, which demolished Frege’s first attempt at axiomatizing set theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Russell’s paradox comes from observing that the complement of any normal set, like the empty set, must contain itself (since this complement contains all nonempty sets, including pathologically large sets like itself).
                Russell then divided sets into two types “pathological” sets which contain themselves, and normal sets, that don’t. He then asked “what is the set of all normal sets?”, i.e. “What is the set of all sets that don’t contain
                themselves?” This question is obviously paradoxical, as this set can neither contain itself or not contain itself, as a moment’s reflection shows. From this point on, everyone got it, including Frege, and the first good
                axiomatizations appeared a decade later, first with Russell’s theory of types, then with Zermelo’s axiomatic set theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Axiomatic set theory goes along the lines suggested by Cantor’s intuition, and it is entirely without the notion of absolute complement. The sets in any modern set theory are built up from the empty set by the processes of
                unions, separation, replacement, and powerset, along with trivial things like pairing. The relevant axioms are “Zermelo Fraenkel set theory”, and these do not include the idea of universal complement. The axiom of foundation
                guarantees that all sets are built from the empty set by a quasi-finite process (meaning that set membership has no loops, if you look at a member of a member of a member of …. a given set, you terminate on the empty set
                after a finite number of steps). A good no-nonsense modern introduction to axiomatic set theory is in Paul Cohen’s “Set Theory and the Continuum Hypothesis”.
            </p>
            <p>
                To make logical operations into a “set theory” of the naive kind, Godel and Bernays reaxiomatized the laws of logic and sets so that they talk about “classes” and “sets” both. Classes are not sets, they are logical
                collections of sets, which are usually too big to also be sets. All sets are classes, but not all classes are sets. You can then talk about “The class of all sets that don’t contain themselves”, and this is not a paradox,
                because this class is not a set. This class is also the entire universe, because in modern set theory, no set contains itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                The formalization of set theory went in tandem with the development of formal logic. You need to understand these things to comment on them, not only because it is interesting, but because you are currently commenting with
                your head up your ass (although in good faith).

            <p>The notion of complement is INSIDE A GIVEN SET. There is no complement relative to the UNIVERSE, because the UNIVERSE IS NOT A SET. This is why people talk about proper classes.</p>
            <p>
                Sets were ORIGINALLY designed to be collections where all the laws of logic had a counterpart in operations on a set. That was Boole and Frege’s original project. This idea DIDN’T WORK, because of Cantor’s and Russells’
                paradoxes. So now sets mean something else, a tower of ordinally constructed objects without a notion of complement, while the word “classes” has taken over for objects which are constructed in correspondence with the laws
                of logic.

                The equivalence between “all nonwhite things are nonswans” and “all swans are white” is exactly the type of thing that Popper claims is asymmetric with respect to verification. It just isn’t. It isn’t quite a double negative
                exactly, that’s nothing at all in usual non-intuitionistic logic. This is the contrapositive, which is nontrivial.
            </p>
            <p>
                To show you a contrapositive without two “not” statements: saying “no swans are black” is the same as saying “all black things are not swans”. The word “not” is used exactly once in both places, but the two statements are
                identical in content.
            </p>
            <p>
                In formal logic, classes and negation behave the same way, so you can speak about not-you and you, so that “I am not tall” is the same thing as saying “all tall things are non-me”, and the statement can be understood as a
                formal statement about classes, and the evidence for the statement is the same as the evidence for the statement “I am not tall”.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rules for evidence are that you make a hypothesis, and test it using the predictions for sense-impressions. The tests are the same whether you are talking about the formal class, or it’s complement, the predictions don’t
                depend on this detail.
            </p>
            <p>The intuition Popper has is not necessary. All you need is Occam’s razor and predictions, and you can start culling theories and making better knowledge.</p>
            <p>
                Also, this dispute is very minor, as I am sure you see. The positivists would not complain about Popper, except to the extent that he was claiming credit for their work, and this is a political issue, not an issue of real
                philosophical dispute.

            <p>
                Ok, but you should realize that the Popperian notions are not incompatible with positivism, but form a primitive approximation to the idea which is attempting to steal credit from the positivists, who came up with a better
                formulation first. This dispute is mostly over extremely minute details of what constitutes a “verification”, but I insist on the positivist formulation, because it is the one that is correct when you formalize logic.
            </p>
            <p>
                I should add that formalizing logic does not preserve all untrained intuitions. In particular, verifying that “all swans are white” is IDENTICAL to verifying that “all nonwhite things are not swans” formally. The intuitive
                distinction between them comes from the number of things that are swans as opposed to the number of non-swans, and the Baysian confidence you gain from observing something nonwhite and concluding it isn’t a swan is
                relatively small compared to the observation of a white swan.
            </p>
            <p>
                But this unformal intuition is simply being exploited by Popper to make a folk-philosophy which is less precise and less rigorous than positivism. But since it is mostly just a primitive version of the same idea, it doesn’t
                lead to infighting, and positivist like Hawking have even (mistakenly) attributed the positivism to Popper, despite his claim to be an anti-positivist! The reason is that the distinction between falsification and
                verification is essentially meaningless in the presence of Occam’s razor, and the dispute, when both positions are sufficiently precise, is nonexistent, as they are the same exact position (although Popper is emphasizing an
                intuitive but formally meaningless distinction, just to do academic politics using people’s untrained intuition).

                Stop talking nonsense, and please learn formal logic. The operation of “not” is not the same thing as the operation of set-complement, it is a PRIMITIVE LOGICAL operation, not realized on sets, as the complement of a set in
                the universe is not itself a set. If you want to talk about logical operations, you should talk about classes. In this case, the class of Earth and the class of not-Earth are completely equivalent objects in set theories
                with classes, anything you can state about one, you can state about the other, and there is no difference between the statements despite your superficial untrained intuition.
            </p>
            <p>
                The operation of LOGICAL not (not set theoretic complement) relates verifiability and falsifiability in all cases trivially. The concept of falsifiability is exploiting an intuition that is false, namely that one direction
                of verification is always easy, and doesn’t require deep induction, while the other direction is always hard.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is in practice often the case, where the theory makes many precise predictions, but it is sometimes not, as for example, the big bang only makes a finite number of predictions, essentially the CMB fluctuations. Further,
                the theory that electrons are responsible for Faraday’s law has exceptions, sometimes the deposition is half the predicted amount. To account for this, you introduce doubly-charged ions, you don’t throw away the Faraday
                theory. This is not a fudge making Faraday theory untestable, it is a development that teaches you something new, that there are doubly charged ions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Theories in sociology are statistical and vague, although still knowledge (for example, that inflationary spending reduces unemployment, or how to control hyperinflation). These theories are full of exceptions, yet you
                muddle through using verification/falsification as best you can, and the main tool is Occam’s razor, and the ability to produce new hypotheses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The distinction between verifiability and falsifiability is never useful in scientific contexts. The important thing is that there are predictions for sense impressions, and that the framework is simple. These two
                constraints together obviate any need to distinguish between falsifying and verifying, which is good, because formal logic can’t distinguish these.

                The assumption is that the state can gang up politically on an individual, and create charges out of thin air by selectively choosing witnesses, bribing or coercing informants to lie, create social consensus through media
                releases, and cherry-pick evidence that suggests guilt (like states tend to do all the time). The requirement of “beyond reasonable doubt” is to protect the individual from the massive power of the state. It was really
                designed to protect wealthy individuals from the various charges that come when the powers in government decide to put them away, because of the political resentment of others who are not so wealthy. But it works to protect
                dissidents and so on, more or less, from capricious charges also. It doesn’t work so well when private power is the one fabricating charges against an individual— sometimes private corporations can get an individual hounded
                or put away using similarly oppressive methods, as in the case of Aaron Schwarz. The issue is how you produce a free society, where the power is distributed broadly, and this has nothing to do with logical positivism.

            <p>
                Look, this type of philosophy is valid and important, but very far removed from questions of semantics and knowledge which positivism is addressing. The positivism is just a foundation, it tells you how to acquire knowledge
                with confidence, it tells you nothing about how these complicated things are supposed to work.

            <p>I did not miss any point, the question of proving guilt and proving innocence are not related by “logical not”. They are treated asymmetrically because there is an asymmetry of power between the state and the individual.</p>
            <p>
                When two individuals are both suing each other, the burden of proof on the two sides is the same, and it is preponderance of the evidence. There is no requirement that one side have overwhelming evidence, unlike the case of
                a criminal trial.
            </p>
            <p>
                These asymmetries are entirely due to political factors, who has power, who has authority, which side is in a position to intimidate or coerce witnesses, and so on and so on. These factors were not present (and should never
                be present, although our world is imperfect) when you are deciding whether Brans-Dicke gravity is better than General Relativity, except to the extent that the scientists involved are also human, and also politicians.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you have scientific data and hypotheses, you prune the hypotheses using Occam’s razor, and you distinguish between them when you have explained ALL the data using one of the ideas, and ruled out the other explanation
                using the same data. If the data is ambiguous, you get more. This is a process which does not require political meddling, and this is the process which positivism places at the core of the theory of knowledge. This process
                also appears in a courtroom, as the testimony of expert witnesses, like fingerprint analysts, or DNA experts, who claim to be reporting the conclusion of such a process.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you are talking about a judge or jury, where they are making and testing hypotheses regarding some activity they aren’t sure about, these people have to build up much more complicated narrative structures of people,
                their relations, their exchange of money, and relate these to the law, to authority, to credibility, admissibility of evidence, and so on, and these structures are purely political. These political structures include
                asymmetric burden of proof, because of asymmetries of power, and they are a headache when you are evaluating scientific theories.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scientific theories are not immune from this sort of political nonsense, as Aristotelianism and Phlogiston show. Indeed, from a human point of view, because of the power-structure of established doctrine in science, you also
                do need to bend over backwards to listen to claims of crazy observations that conflict with established dogma, and keep testing the dogma, because there is always the possibility that the dogma is all wrong, and the
                conflicting observations were politically suppressed. But this is ultimately a game with credibility and politics, and in science, because you are dealing with nature, you can always resolve these disputes unambiguously by
                just repeating the experiments and observations until you know exactly what was going on, by making and testing the hypotheses repeatedly. The politics gets in the way, sure, but the burden of proof for a theory is to
                explain EVERYTHING, not just some things better, and the theory is only definitively accepted (in an idealization) once ALL the data is consistent with the theory, and the mistake which led to all inconsistent data is
                identified.

                It’s always the same theory of knowledge, but in the sophisticated areas, the knowledge is talking about very sophisticated abstractions, where you’ll never get a chance to do such a careful inquiry. In that case, you make a
                meta-theory about probabilities of different scenerios, and try to distinguish between their plausibility. Within physics, you see the pure mechanism of knowledge production, because the extraneous political complications
                are stripped away.

            <p>
                And indeed, the job of the defence attorney in a modern state is to show that the prosecuter “did NOT prove the defendent guilty”. The job is not to prove that the defendent is NOT guilty. If you don’t know formal logic, you
                sometimes make ridiculous mistakes like this.

                These higher structures are very complicated anyway, they are human, involving abstract ideas of “fairness” and “justice” and “authority”, in a situation of extremely imperfect knowledge. They are many steps removed from

                to be simple, even the difference between “prove A” and “prove not A” disappears.

                That’s Popperian nonsense. There is no difference between verifiability and falsifiability, they are related by the operation of “logical not”. If the oasis recedes as you approach it, it is a mirage, and whether this is a
                falsification of “this is water” or a verification of “this is is not water” is trivially logically identical. The two statements are negations of each other!
            </p>
            <p>
                The distinction between “falsifiability” and “verifiability” is nonsense in formal logic, because they are obviously equivalent, since “not” is a primitive operation. So why is it that Popper was able to go on with this
                nonsense for so long?
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s because you need scientific induction to make frameworks. When doing inference that involve scientific induction, one direction of induction is usually easy (falsified!) and one direction of induction is hard
                (verified!) This asymmetry is due to the fact that theories usually make precise predictions in one direction only, for example “water will get closer to me as I walk towards it”, which are easy to check, because they are
                precise. Conversely, usually the other direction “a mysterious new phenomenon that looks like water” which usually doesn’t come with precise predictions, and which cannot be checked.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the reason is simply the asymmetry in induction produced when there is a precise theory. To falsify a precise theory is easy, because it predicts a ton of precise sense-data, while to verify the same theory involves an
                induction step, because at some point you need to accept the theory, which makes an infinite number of predictions, using only finitely many observations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem of induction in positivism is solved using a precise formulation of Occam’s razor which uses Kolmogorov complexity (ciomputer program length). The criterion of simplicity is made precise using the length of the
                shortest program which makes the predictions, and the statement of induction is that you continuously update the program predicting the sense-data to the Kolmogorov simplest one which is in accordance with the data so far.
            </p>
            <p>This principle includes both “Falsification” and “verification” and relates them by logical not. There is no difference.</p>
            <p>
                Popper made up this “falsification” nonsense so as to steal “verification” from the positivists. The positivists were usually politically incompatible with Popper, as a lot of them were socialists, and he was a traditional
                liberal. “Falsification” is prattle which is propped up because it sounds nice to an ignorant student, it is a primitive form of verification, and if you add induction (which you need to do anyway), it is completely
                equivalent to verification, except it allows Popper to steal credit from the positivists for this idea.

                Exactly— these things you talk about, the frameworks of interpretation, are all making predictions about FUTURE DATA, and you learn to make these predictions by synthesizing them from previous sense data, and making
                predictions about future sense data, and seeing which predictions are correct and which predictions are not correct, using new data.
            </p>
            <p>
                The framework for interpreting the sense data is subject to evolutionary change, and to some a-priori constraint, from Occam’s razor. if you like, you choose the simplest framwork among those that maximize your life
                expectancy. But since this is not Darwinian evolution, it is better to say, you choose the framework consistent with sense data so as to maximize the correct predictions of future observations.

                That’s how physics philosophy works, and it is essential to doing physics, because in quantum mechanics, the sense-data reported by different observers is not consistent with a traditional classical reality underneath, but
                with something else. Some take it to be a many-worlds reality, others with a purely positivistic unreality. So long as the predictions are unaltered, which point of view you take between those that predict the same
                impressions is a free choice, the two positions are not distinct, they are “equivalent in positivism”. The equivalence means that it is senseless to ask which framework is correct, when the sense-data predicted is the same.
                The question “which framework among these two predicting the same impressions” is correct is a Carnap non-question, it’s nonsense. Carnap called it “metaphysics”, but it includes questions like “is many-worlds correct, or
                Copenhangen correct?” which are not traditionally considered metaphysics. That’s the main upshot of positivism— identifying together as equivalent any two philosophical positions which are superficially different in their
                mental structure, but which predict the exact same impressions in all cases. A clear example from physics is the choice of gauge in electromagnetism— any two gauges make the exact same predictions in every case, so it is
                senseless to ask which is correct. Rather, you can choose one, and freely translate to any other, without thinking you are somehow changing anything at all, even though the mathematical description superficially changes
                between the gauges. Ditto for change of basis in quantum mechanics, change of picture in string theory, introducing ghosts, doing a different path integral, all things physicsts swap around all the time, but philosophers
                stop and say “hold it! Which one is right in reality?” A stupid question, because positivism shows that not only has no answer, it is not<br />
                even a real question.
            </p>
            <p>
                This point of view regarding how knowledge is built up was accepted in philosophy from the 1940s to the 1960s, but went out of fasion in the 1970s, as people made up certain “problems” with it. The only problem is that is is
                correct, and cutting, in that it shows that most of philosophy is empty prattle, as it has no significance in predicting future sense-impressions, or organizing past ones.

                You DON’T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING! The jpg of the oasis IS the basic data you start with. There is no interpretation on this, NADA, NOTHING. No “This is an oasis”, no “this is an illusion due to light curvature”, nothing but a
                jpg, a list of pixel intensities. That’s it, no extra structure, just the basic data. The interpretations, even the most primitive ones like “hey, that toast looks like Jesus” come from doing INFERENCE on the basic data,
                using formal logic (usually in your brain, sometimes on a computer), and being open to competely changing the inference based on new sensory impressions. When you are talking about illusions, you are talking about a sudden
                change of inference due to more careful observation, i.e. more data, with no change in the basic data at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no a-priori requirement in positivism that the sensory impressions reported by different observers have to come together to make a coherent single picture of reality. This just is an observation that is true in the
                classical world, and one that arguably fails in quantum mechanics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The interpretation “There is an oasis there” is an INFERENCE, a THEORY. It is open to getting replaced with any other theory that explains the same sense data, including “I was hallucinating” or “my senses were misfiring”.
                All of these are plausible hypotheses, and they are deduced from the basic sense-data, which you can’t argue with, because this and Occam’s razor is pretty much all you have.
            </p>
            <p>That’s POSITIVISM.</p>
            <p>The basic data comes with NO INTERPRETATION AT ALL, not even the basic scanning of a human brain. It’s just pure data.</p>

                These are not what is meant by “direct observations” in positivism, these are all (false) inferences regarding higher order structure. Also, are you my personal minder? What are you doing commenting on a not-particularly
                widely appreciated debate in physics philosophy?
            </p>
            <p>
                A “direct observation”: I see the following jpg-data in my eyes. I hear the following wmv data in my ears. There is NO EXTRA STRUCTURE imposed over this, like “I see a face”, just the direct sensory data. You can’t theorize
                this away means this is irreducible data. This is what you build yout theory out of, whether that theory is “this is gold” or “this is fool’s gold”. “I am hallucinating” or “this is reproducible”.
            </p>
            <p>
                It can’t be lying to you, because, in positivism, it is what everything else is made of, it is the foundation of what you are after explaining. The notions of “fool’s gold”, “mirage”, “illusion”, “psychosis” are just more
                abstract categories which are used to make predictions about future sense impression. In the case of fool’s gold, what a gold-broker would say to you if you tried to sell him some, in the case of hallucinations, about some
                consistency properties of the impression.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no further claim about reality than the statement that it involves a coherent meshing of impressions among folks who communicate, and there is no a-priori notions used to make sense of sensory experience, just what
                you are given in the sense data.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important in physics, because when you have a scientific revolution, like relativity, quantum mechanics, etc, you end up changing all the high-level interpretation while the sense data is unaltered, so that it’s like
                finding out that a bunch of stuff you thought was gold is all fool’s gold. It is also important because putting together a notion of reality in quantum mechanics is impossible without positivism, and even then, it is weird
                and unreal. It is an essential part of modern physics, and it is rejected in philosophy, for stupid reasons.

                This is a nonsense critique of straw-man positivism. The position of the logical positivists was coherent, but the formalization by Carnap had a few minor flaws, which were not particularly significant or important. The
                problem was academic politics— the positivists simply resolved the age-old mysteries of philosophy, and resolved them for good, by showing, not that they are deep mysteries, but gibberish and wankery. This creates a lot of
                hostility.
            </p>
            <p>
                You have stated the principle of positivism more or less as Mach stated it, but it needs more careful statement. Physicists starting with Mach, but not ending with Mach, developed positivism in the 20th century. Essentially
                all physicists continue to be positivists until today, without understanding that they are adopting Mach’s philosophy, because, in Einstein’s words “They have imbibed it in their mother’s milk”.
            </p>
            <p>
                The proper statement of positivism is that the sensory experience is the fundamental object which is invariant to theorizing away, you can’t theorize away a direct observation, so that it forms the foundation of knowledge.
                The other conceptions are important only to the extent that they have an impact, direct or indirect, on sensory experience. So you need to give a path from the object you are hypothesizing directly to a sensory experience to
                be sure you know what you are talking about.
            </p>
            <p>
                This principle is extremey important, and it is clarified by some examples from physics. The first notion which is clarified is the “electric field”. What is a “field”? The answer is that you can measure the field by placing
                charges at a position in space, and seeing how they accelerate. This procedure defines what the content of the field is in a postivist way, and allows you to be sure that the field is a sensible thing to introduce into a
                formalism.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another example is a “gauge”. The gauge of electromagnetism, unlike the fields, does not have any impact on observations— any gauge choice gives the same answer as any other. Does that mean that the postivists reject a
                choice of gauge? This is explicity false! Their experience was from GR and the choice of coordinate system there, Einstein’s positivism, and this experience made it clear that you CAN talk about a gauge, but you consider the
                question “which gauge is real” to be meaningless. That’s not the same as saying “you don’t need to choose a gauge”, or “gauge’s can’t be chosen”, or “gauges don’t exist”. It’s the statement that “gauge choice is immaterial,
                and any one choice is as good as any other, and you can translate freely between the gauges. No argument depends on choice of gauge in a crucial way, although some arguments might be simpler or clearer in one gauge rather
                than another.”
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the positivist insight that Carnap et al were formalizing in various degrees of formality in the 1940s and 1950s. It is not the same as saying that ONLY sense experience is admissible in a model of nature (as Mach
                sometimes overstated a little), because, as you say (and as Riechenbacher and Carnap understood very well), you need all sorts of apparatus to make sense of the primitive bit-values in the sense-data. It is next to
                impossible to disentangle sense-data from non-sense data, because you need to consider the data in the processing stages of the conscious mind, which, as you say, involves a lot of uncontrolled approximations.
            </p>
            <p>
                But there is a principle here, a simple one: within our given framework, we can talk about sense data. Within the enlargements of the framework to new concepts, there are questions which make claims about future or present
                sense-data, and questions which do not make any such claims. The answer to questions which do not make any claims about sense-data are A FREE CHOICE, they are up to you, just like a gauge in electromagnetism. You can
                translate freely from any answer to any other, and the question “which answer is correct” is nonsense, it is metaphysical, and has no answer because it has no meaning.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the fundamental insight of the positivists. It can’t die, because it is true. It is used ALL THE TIME in physics, and it forms the core confusion that non-physicists have when discussing physics. If you don’t accept
                that a question which has no impact on future sense-data is arbitrary and meaningless, you can’t make the framework shifts required for the theoretical advances in physics.
            </p>
            <p>Here is a list of meaningless questions in physics (that are trivial once you understand logical positivism, but hopeless otherwise):</p>
            <p>
                1. Are gauge ghosts actual particles?<br />
                2. Does the electron have a position in the ground state of Hydrogen, if you aren’t measuring where it is?<br />
                3. Are confined particles, like quarks, actual particles?<br />
                4. Do objects cross the black-hole event horizon or get smeared on the surface, never falling through?<br />
                5. Are Green-Schwarz superstrings the same as RNS superstrings?
            </p>
            <p>
                I could go on all day. All these superficially sensible questions are obviously nonsensical in logical postivism, and to simply study physics, you can’t avoid imbibing the entire philosophy right at the outset, and
                definitely when you study quantum mechanics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result is a complete disconnect between physics and philosophy, due to the deranged reaction against positivism in philosophy departments. The positivism is not “wrong”, it is RIGHT! It is the only right answer. There is
                no other answer, there is no POINT in looking for another answer, the question has been resolved, and it has been resolved FOR GOOD, and EVERYONE IN PHYSICS KNOWS IT, and gets PISSED OFF AT THE IDIOTS AT THE PHILOSOPHY
                DEPARTMENT FOR SCREWING UP THIS OBVIOUS TRIPE WITH POLITICAL OBFUSCATION.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem here is that the discourse in philosophy is political, and permanently broken. These people are basically nitwits, and should not exist. The exceptions are those that do mathematical stuff, or study philosophy of
                political movements and things like this, but usually not. The problems stem from the subservience of philosophy to the hierarchical order of society, so that philosophers are genteel, high-class, well-spoken, mild-mannered,
                bourgeoise types. Science is done by proles, and logical positivism is the revenge of the proles.

                Wrong kind of illiteracy, fool. Functional illiteracy isn’t about phonics or sounding out words. 100% of Americans can do that. Functional illiteracy is the discomfort with complex sentences, full of grammatical recursive

            <p>
                The people who argue for moderation want to get rid of insults in one direction only, the insults going from the powerless to the powerful. Insults from the powerful to the powerless are usually subtle, and invisible to
                everyone except those they are insulting.

                The problem with internet comment moderation is that it enforces the point of view of the moderator, except in cases where the moderator takes special effort to be open to all positions. The role of the internet is to allow
                the creative destruction of bad ideas, and this process is extremely rude, but must be allowed to function.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the real world, moderation powers are used to suppress dissent much more often than they are used to get rid of threats. The simple fact is that threats hardly ever come, and when they do, they can be handled simply by
                usual methods, as they are abberations. One of the nice things online is that there is a nearly insuperable barrier to violence, which protects opinions from retribution.
            </p>
            <p>
                The open discussion is more valuable if it is let alone. That doesn’t mean that every comment needs to be preserved, but comments which are long, which are thought out, which have nontrivial statements (including rude ones)
                are important, because they show disagreement. The rudeness is the most important feature, as it leads to accuracy over time, even in competely uncensored places, like youtube comments, you can find nontrivial discussions
                which converge on unpopular truths, so long as the discussion is both rude, and focused.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal for me is preserving rude focused honest discussion. Any attack on rudeness is ultimately an attack on honesty, even if it is tempered with moderation and sounds reasonable. Censorship always sounds reasonable, and
                it hardly ever is.

            <p>
                The linking of internet hostility to violence is a false association designed to prevent hostile and rude internet peer review from working, by requiring niceness. There is no nice way to say “you are full of crap”, and
                there is no threat of violence in that.

                The details of the collectivization famine in the USSR: there was a smaller Khazakstan famine in 1931 in the pilot collectivization program, and then a terrible all-USSR famine, worst in the Ukraine in 1932 and surrounding
                regions, which is the one that claimed millions of victims.

            <p>
                The bad harvests were all the initial collectivized harvests, as collective farms are intrinsically less efficient than small plots, and further, the new labor on these farms was inexperienced in collective farming and run
                incompetently. The famine ended with the first good harvests of 1933. During that year, the mortality was atrocious.

                The year starting from the bad 1932 harvest and ending with the good 1933 harvest is the singular year of Stalin’s famine. It does not comprise a single calendar year, since harvests don’t come in January. There was some
                food insecurity later too, the collective farming was not very good.

                I don’t deny the Ukrainian famine. I am telling you what it was. It was a collectivization of farming and the associated collectivization famine, which occurs again in every involuntary collectivization effort in
                agriculture. It is a genocide in the same sense as the Irish famine was a genocide. I would argue that both are genocides broadly speaking. The collectivization and collective measures which led to starvation was bad enough
                as it was.
            </p>
            <p>
                But all the discussions regarding the number of Stalin’s victims are straight up lies, taking victims of famine, and turning them into victims of political execution. and one must be rude and spit on the graves of millions
                of actually suffering people to correct this.
            </p>
            <p>
                The extent of the 1932-33 famine is difficult to judge, but the number of non-famine victims of Stalin is of order 1 million people, and the number of famine victims has been played with politically. The best estimate I
                would make personally is 5 million famine victims over all the USSR, mostly children and the elderly, which is a pretty catastrophic famine, and is consistent with the reminiscences of people I have read from the era. The
                1932 famine is the worst death toll associated with Stalin, and it is not political repression exactly, but collectivized agriculture. Mao’s collectivization program led to a worse famine.

                all and get a good picture. But that’s not what happened, instead, the honest stuff has been suppressed, and dishonest lies have been promoted. You are promoting the lies.
            </p>
            <p>
                My sources were never the Soviet census of 1939, I vaguely remember that, but it is usual lying nonsense. I never cited any sources at all for my claims, I don’t need to, as I expect the reader to dig for themselves. But if
                you want the personal story, I personally read many of the discussions about the famine in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the Soviet archives were opened, and I went into great detail, including poring over whatever
                published statistics I could find, because I was curious about how Soviet communism could even function. I didn’t understand how you could run an entire economy from the top down. I got a reasonable picture of all the
                relevant events, but I was 16 years old, and it was a long time ago. I am not going to repeat the effort, because there has been no new discoveries, all that has happened is that more and more vile propaganda has
                progressively replaced the honest (negative) assessments of the early 1990s.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know the rough magnitude of the 1932 famine, it was pretty large as far as famines go. But a famine with 5 million death toll in a single year is an ENORMOUS famine, it is STUPENDOUS. It would leave a generational memory,
                it is not a small thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The famine was acknowledged to be large internally relatively honestly from Khruschev’s time onwards. The census data you find in the 1950s are accurate and reliable, and generally the post-Stalin Soviet figures are very
                good. The global 1939 population census figures were lies, and these are not the “honest and reliable” figures I was talking about. The honest and reliable figures in that era are not global, but local statistics for labor
                and population, year of birth, year of death, which you can find in the Soviet archives and which allow historians to piece together a picture of the arrests and the famine.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other source I used is randomly polled Russians and Ukrainians, just as a sanity check, to make sure I wasn’t missing a holocaust. I did the same sanity check with European jews, to make sure that I wasn’t inventing a
                holocaust. This is very easy to do personally, so you get a picture of the events without any reliance on anyone else. This is an important sanity check, a sanity check you didn’t do, you lying little Eichmann.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is one extremely notable person who reports a very high famine mortality in his village, that is Gorbachev. He claims 4 immediate relative dying, children and old folks all over his village, as is typical of a famine,
                he is telling the truth. The claim for a 40% mortality in his village is very credible, and there is no reason to dispute it, and I don’t.
            </p>
            <p>
                The famine was a serious thing, affecting large regions of the country, and there were places where the mortality was enormous. But there are also places with very few famine mortalities, like the big cities, or certain
                villages, because relief efforts or hidden sources of grain mitigated the starvation. You need a random sample of people to know what the extent of the famine was, so that you can estimate the number of victims properly.
                Taking one person among the worst affected and making them statistically representative is what you are doing. In order for the figures you claim are correct to actually be correct, Gorbachev’s experience would have to be
                typical. It is not, Gorbachev experience reflects that of a minority of about 10%. That makes number of famine victims is surely quite large— on the order of 2-5 million people, perhaps more, perhaps 10 million, perhaps even
                more 4% of the USSR population is 6.4 million people, that’s a reasonable estimate. I personally don’t know the precise figures, and it is difficult to estimate, because unlike political repression, the victims are generally
                invisible— infants and the elderly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 1932-33 famine is by far the largest mortality associated with Stalin. It does not come anywhere near the claims of 20 million deaths or 60 million deaths, and it has nothing to do with political executions. The number
                of political executions is of the order of 1 million people. The remaining mortality is all famine deaths in one year, 1932-33, and these deaths were localized, and did not constitute direct repression, rather the usual
                indirect production and distribution stupidities of communism. You simply don’t know how to think, so you conflate these in the same way other propagandists do.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Soviet figures were honest and reliable regarding their internal labor statistics, internal births and deaths. The Soviet Union in the years after Stalin was generally pretty honest about Stalin’s crimes, with some
                politically inexpedient exceptions like the Katyn massacre.
            </p>
            <p>But I am talking to a buffoon, who does not understand subtlety, so it is better to just say “The Soviets were honest and reliable”.</p>

            <p>She has argued for censorship of comments in the past, that’s what led to the conflict, and she argues for civility. Censorship is evil, and civility is evil.</p>
            <p>
                The internet is rude for a reason, it is rude so that you can’t do propaganda without getting insulted. The insults are healthy to the extent that they prevent formation and concentrations of authority, and they work. People
                online have zero authority, and an authority free open discussion leads to truth very quickly becoming self-evident.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our comment discussion is an example. I think anyone reviewing the discussion has a much greater chance of getting an accurate historical picture than if this person watched all the documentaries on the subject on TV. The
                discussion itself is useless, it is simply a handle for people to search for related academic materials and read them. Hostile discussions lead to accuracy, because people are given a stark choice between different bony
                skeletons upon which they can hang the facts they find online. The facts they find independently quickly make it clear which skeleton is more accurate.
            </p>
            <p>But propaganda tries to disallow certain things from getting said, especially rude things, because rudeness kills propaganda dead. So you get an elephant man version of the truth.</p>
            <p>
                Online hostility can lead to some personal nuisances sometimes, the author of the article did feel psychologically threatened because someone posted her home address. That’s unfortunate, it shouldn’t have happened, but it
                isn’t particularly terrible. She should know better than to think that a flame war is a motive for violence, and she shouldn’t call the flame war “death threats”, and she should make insinuations that her children were
                threatened, because her adult children were not threatened (and neither was she threatened in any credible way).
            </p>
            <p>
                The internet produces a nearly insuperable barrier between speech and violence, so the discussions can be free to be vicious. Vicious discussions immediately neutralize propaganda from any side, whether the propaganda is for
                accurate or inaccurate viewpoints.

                All it takes is one person saying “boo hoo” for a sob story to be neutralized. All it takes is one person calling you names for consensus to disappear momentarily. The way to verify the truth of assertions is to research
                them using neutral scholarly sources, and this doesn’t happen unless people see an irreconcilable conflict.

                I am aware of the lies of the communists, and I am also aware of the dishonesty and political pressure. What you are are not aware of is the complementary dishonesty on the other side, the liberal side. This dishonesty leads
                politicians to lie about statistics, as they are either too stupid, or figure the public is too stupid, to do accurate math.
            </p>
            <p>
                There simply were no 20 million dead under Stalin. I don’t have to be persuasive while I say it, because it is a simple and easily verified fact. You need to check case by case, and independent of BOTH the Soviets and the
                Liberals, because both of these devils lie.
            </p>
            <p>The way you verify this is to go up to a former Soviet resident, and ask them:</p>
            <p>“Who are your closest relatives killed by Stalin?”</p>
            <p>
                This is usually a statistical sample of ~50-100 persons, depending on how large the extended family is. You can know exactly how many are sampled by asking about the extent of the family knowledge. All you need are 10
                Russians and Ukrainians to get a reasonably accurate estimate.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the death rate is 60 million, you expect two grandmothers killed and a grandfather, a third to half the family wiped out in a conflagration analogous to a limited nuclear holocaust. For 20 million, you expect every family
                to have one grandfather dead, a mortality in the first 8 people alive in the era. If it’s 2 million, you expect a distant cousin to have been arrested, and to have heard about a distant second cousin who was executed or died
                of hunger. The last is the typical situation when interviewing Russians about personal family deaths, which are independent and not subject to manipulation by any authorities on either side.
            </p>
            <p>The order of magnitude points to order 10 million arrested and order 1 million killed, something which is already atrocious levels of state terror, which do not need exaggeration to be seen as terrible.</p>
            <p>
                Anything which is inconsistent with this order of magnitude is a lie. I don’t need anyone to confirm this, as I have actually talked to Russians and Ukrainians, asking this quesiton, while doing this statistical estimation
                in my head, and so can you.
            </p>
            <p>
                The famine deaths are a bit different, there were deaths by weakness and disease from the famine, mostly of young children, who tend to not get recorded in family oral history. These deaths perhaps amount to 5 million over
                the whole USSR, but perhaps 10 million also. The demographic dip for the USSR in the early 1930s is similar to the demographic dip in the US in the 1930s US (but much larger, perhaps about 20 million people). The US
                demographic dip claimed 5-10 million people demographically, although of course this simply all consists of postponed births, and these people reappear as the baby boom. You can’t say “Hoover and Roosevelt murdered 5 million
                Americans! Eisenhower miraculously resuscitates them.” because they didn’t and he didn’t.

                I didn’t read your links, because I have already concluded that you are a dishonest clown, and I ignore whatever you say. An honest person needs to sit down and do the survey I requested, which is easy for you, being
                Ukrainian— you already know the answer. It just isn’t the same as what you are doing propaganda for.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also cite no sources, and give no persuasive argument, nor direct evidence, I let people do their own research. It is true that there was bad political census data in Stalin’s time— it is also true that I shout and scream,
                and tell you inconsistent things. It doesn’t matter— I am honest globally, which is all that matters, and I did not deliberately misinform anyone of anything, unlike you. While I did know about the census attack in the
                1930s, I also know that it is easy to work around these kind of bad official numbers, because when the census bureau is attacked, it is only the global figures that need to be fudged. The local numbers are ok, for example,
                labor statistics for each city, and sampled birth and death records for each region. These are what are used by the honest historians to estimate the tolls from these tragedies, and these estimates are never sensationalist
                lying figures of 20 million or 60 million, but honest figures consistent with the sampling of family history.
            </p>
            <p>The family history, which is available to any interested person who knows some Russians and Ukrainians, just doesn’t care about the census takers, or about any officials at all.</p>
            <p>
                What you are doing is only a game with authority, a game which simply does not work online, as it does in person or on TV (it’s surprising, I know, but it’s true). I verified the assertions I am making with excellent
                confidence a long time ago, anyone can check that the numbers people give here are made up, therefore I don’t need to do anything except shout.

                briefly, but he wasn’t in his office the two days I came by to yell at him, so I gave up. I did manage to tell Stanley Fish off once (on something unrelated), and we had a nice talk outside the hall after his lecture, where
                he told me “You are much too optimistic regarding the intelligence of the general public” or something to that effect. I am not intimidated by authoritative numbskulls, I have been around at least two ACTUAL academic

                any stake in historical accuracy. Historical accuracy is the FIRST VICTIM in these sorts of times, and these people are simply TALKING OUT OF THEIR ANUS, JUST LIKE YOU.

            <p>
                This is not ANTI-RUSSIAN, at least not if you mean post-Soviet Russia, it is simply PROPAGANDA. The propaganda is to emphasize the very real suffering in Soviet times using CRAP NUMBERS PULLED OUT OF ASSES. I care more about
                accurate numbers than people’s suffering. I actually don’t give a crap about people. My concern here is with accurate numbers. I just HATE lying with numbers worse than anything else!

                The number of Stalin executions is in the .5-1.5 million range. The number of Stalin famine deaths is more uncertain, but it is most likely between 2 and 6 million, and that’s all USSR during 1932. That’s it. There’s nothing
                else. Everything else is STUPID LYING by people who don’t GIVE A CRAP ABOUT HISTORICAL ACCURACY, and POLLUTE THE LITERATURE WITH THEIR FARTS.

                The census bureau in the 1930s was attacked politically, but THESE ARE NOT THE FIGURES ONE USES TO ESTIMATE THE FAMINE. You can easily estimate the famine deaths from polling families, YOU COULD DO IT TOO, IF YOU WEREN’T A
                DISHONEST FASCIST APOLOGIST. This is a simple way of estimating famine mortality, it works very well for the Irish famine after more than 150 years, it works very well for ALL FAMINES. The Famine in the USSR in 1932 was
                accompanied by food insecurity relief efforts which mitigated the death toll, and it was brief, as the 1933 harvest was abundant. The famine year might have claimed 6 million lives in the USSR, it is POSSIBLE, but it might
                have claimed 2 million lives, or 8 million lives, as it is difficult to estimate with dishonest CHARLATANS running about claiming numbers pulled out of their behinds as worthy of respect.
            </p>
            <p>
                The process of collectivization in the Ukraine was accompanied by confiscation of land, forcible removal of grain and seed stock, and the complete destruction of private farming, and the simultaneous introduction of
                intrinsically less efficient collective farming. This process is a terrible crime IN ITSELF, and the associated famine is A PREDICTABLE CONSEQUENCE today, after the experience of 1932 and the analogous experience in China in
                the 1960s, but it was not clear to communists steeped in 1930s propaganda. Collectivization leads to famine, it is well known today, it was simply not known in 1932.
            </p>
            <p>
                The death toll of the famine is by far the largest mortality associated with Stalin’s turn at the top. This famine mortality swamps all other mortalities from executions and labor mortality, which are estimated and compiled
                in serious journals by serious historians, and do not amount to a greater death toll than street homelessness does in the US. This IS NOT TO MINIMIZE EITHER DEMOCIDE, street homelessness is terrible, and the gulag was
                terrible, in roughly equal measure. The famine is something else altogether, because it meant food insecurity for enormous chunks of the entire Soviet Union, and it should have been a predictable consequence of the policy of
                collectivization, but it wasn’t predicted. Instead, these consequences were swept under the rug.
            </p>

                The attribution of the famine deaths to Stalin is, in my opinion, justified, because of the political hiding of the famine. But it is ARGUABLE, because the collectivization was not a one-man job, it was supported by
                rank-and-file party members, and the famine was NOT DELIBERATE, it was due to THE USUAL COMMUNIST STUPIDITY, although the relief effort might have been selective in targeting the Ukraine. The famine has been OBSCENELY
                POLITICIZED and subject to MADE UP PROPAGANDA ESTIMATES, and there is no discussion with HISTORICAL FABRICATORS. Whether you are a socialist or a liberal, the only defence against darkness is telling the truth LOUDLY.
            </p>
            <p>
                The enormous numbers of deaths people claim under Stalin are INCOMPREHENSIBLY STUPID, EASILY REFUTED, REPREHENSIBLE LIES which have been studied and understood since the opening of the historical archives in the USSR in
                1989. I am not arguing with such stupidity, simply because I don’t need to— there are dozens of honest socialist and honest liberal web pages which describe the deaths in that period, as well as dozens of dishonest socialist
                and dishonest liberal web pages describing the same events. These are full of authoritative citations and figures, and it is extremely easy to see who is telling the truth when estimating the deaths.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those who make up large numbers conflate loss of property with loss of life. They turn every kulak who lost their land into a victim of homicide, and turn every imprisonment or demotion into a murder. But since their numbers
                are drawn from honest sources, it is very easy to see what is really going on by simply reinterpreting the same figures honestly. There were indeed about 20 million people demoted at some point in Stalin’s time, and if you
                consider getting fired from a nice position a type of victimization, then in some figurative sense, perhaps 20 million party members were victims. Stalin played musical chairs with the leadership of the party. But this is a
                TRAVESTY and a MOCKERY of the actual victims who were executed. The figures of 20 million dead, 60 million dead, or 110 million dead are simply incomprehensibly stupid laughable jokes, and deserve mention only as an example
                of how divorced from any notions of accuracy the liberal press has become in recent decades.
            </p>
            <p>There is NO BASIS IN FACT FOR THE CLAIMS OF TENS OF MILLIONS DEAD, and one cannot argue against a person who makes such claims, simply expose you for what you are, a pathetic lying fraud.</p>

                The KULAKS were LIQUIDATED AS A CLASS by CONFISCATING THEIR PROPERTY and driven to join the collective farms, where they would be assigned jobs and given a wage. They often REFUSED to do this, and resisted the confiscation
                of their property with violent reprisals or by destroying their property before it could be confiscated. These might be natural reactions to confiscation, but that is what was going on— a large chunk of the nation was in
                revolt.
            </p>
            <p>
                The story you tell is IDIOTIC as usual. The farmer would not have thier farm coverted to a collective farm overnight, the land would be seized, the grain would be siezed, and collective farms would open up in separate places
                with separate people running them. The issue is that the landholders objected to the seizure, and the government collectively punished the region by withholding food aid. This is a form of collective punishment which can be
                classified as genocide, but you NEED TO KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING, and YOU CAN’T MAKE CRAP UP WILLY NILLY, LIKE YOU LIKE TO DO.

                The foreign press reports were all fabricated, journalists could not go there. These reports are stupid, they are long discredited, and they came from the Hearst yellow press which was MENTALLY RETARDED. Still, the fact that
                people are LYING, doesn’t mean that they get it WRONG. DESPITE THE LYING, THERE STILL WAS A FAMINE. But the Hearst press reports are not evidence, and the people reporting these things were just doing propaganda using other
                people’s suffering.
            </p>
            <p>
                The best evidence is from your own family and that of others. You can examine the current age of Ukranians, to see the characteristic childhood mortality dip caused by a famine. You can ask people about lost children, lost
                farms, what happened in the year of the famine. When you do, you will get a reasonable estimate of the causalties— I estlmate they were roughly in the 2-3 million range, perhaps as high as 5 million, perhaps 7 million, but
                no more. They also have nothing to do with the Kulaks, who were shot in the hundreds of thousands, but make a relatively negligible contribution to the death toll. There was a smaller numbers of deaths outside the Ukraine
                due to the famine also, and there is dispute about whether the food relief efforts discriminated against the Ukraine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those who were on collective farms did not starve, although they also suffered from the food shortages. You need to LEARN TO BE HONEST, and then ONE CAN DISCUSS. Until then, just shut up, because all you are doing is
                ignorant propaganda.

                Heh. So in America they call you a dirty collectivist, outside they call you a brainwashed individualist. I am not a part of the community under discussion, at least not in any significant way and surely not for 20 years. My

                I defend these trolls because I was followed the original trolling usenet group in my youth, and I see the purpose and value of this group. They helped make sure that polite consensus would be jostled every once in a while,
                to make enough chaos for new things to be able to form. This activity is very psychologically unsettling, and it feels like violence, but there is no real threat to people. Still, in response to the feeling of violent ideas,
                there is real censorship being instituted on various discussion forums, and this censorship immediately removes their potential for accurate peer review.

                I don’t claim that an individual must shed all allegiances, rather that the evaluation of truth and falsehood regarding matters of fact should be made completely indepedently of those allegiances, by rejecting them
                temporarily and adopting new ones in the middle of the evaluation. So you should evaluate the holocaust in the identity of a Jew and as a Neo-Nazi, and then you will get a full picture, for example, as Pressac carefully did.
                That’s not the same thing as averaging the numbers published by Neo Nazis and Jews. Only one of those numbers is at all close to the truth, the truth is not an average of every opinion, but it doesn’t hurt to examine from
                all perspectives, including heinous and evil ones.

                You are IGNORANT of the form of the Soviet economy. The farms were siezed and collectivized, and those peasants who could not make a living were driven to join the collective farms. The collectivization in the Ukraine
                produced collectivized farming and famine. What it did NOT produce is 11 million DEAD KULAKS. It produced 11 million FORMER KULAKS, some of whom died during the famine.
            </p>
            <p>
                The extent of all this is disputed, and one should actually do a survey of families to determine the extent of the famine. I urge you to start with yours. One should do this individually, because states can’t be trusted to
                do objective research. The size of the famine is roughly comparable to the Irish famine, where the family stories easily let you get an accurate estimate of the number of victims. You should see a large number of infant and
                elderly deaths in 1932-33, which will let you pinpoint the number of victims to within 10%. I’d guess 2-3 million people died in the famine, and that guess is better than the toilet paper estimates you get from so-called
                scholars today.

                The mention of hunger was a state offence in 1950, it wasn’t an offence in 1959, when the Soviet Union was trying to get its act together. The attacks on the census bureau did lead to fudging problems. Such census problems
                were LOCALIZED, and can be worked around by any good historian by reviewing local labor and production numbers which include economic figures which are verified internally, which do not suffer from fudging problems because
                they are not ever delivered to Mr. Joseph. I WASN’T USING THE 170 MILLION CENSUS, NOBODY TOOK THOSE INFLATED NUMBERS SERIOUSLY, NOT INTERNALLY AND NOT EXTERNALLY.
            </p>
            <p>
                The collectivization famine led millions of people to go hungry, and a certain number of weakened people died of hunger or disease, possibly two million, maybe six million (you need to verify these sorts of claims with a
                personally conducted survey of random Ukranain families). Informal estimates of Ukrainian population decline in 1932-33 are of about 5 million deaths, and it seems to be greater than Ukrainian deaths in WWII, although you
                need to verify this by reviewing randomly selected family records, and seeing the statistics for mortality in WWII compared to death by starvation. Both are widely randomly distributed, and the comparison is fair. PLEASE DO
                THE COMPARISON, because I want to know what was actually happening. You can start with your own family, and that of Ukrainians you know— what’s the number and ratio of WWII deaths and 1932-33 famine deaths?
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s difficult to know what was happening because there is a GOVERNMENT making DISHONEST, LYING, STRUCTURAL PROPAGANDA, and IDIOTS LIKE YOU lying with them, repeating RIDICULOUS ASSERTIONS where every confiscation of
                property and arrest gets turned into an execution. This is LYING about human misery, and also profiting from it. Just BE HONEST and do the estimates independently.

                The Ukrainian famine numbers were first acknowledged during the Khruschov thaw, when Soviet citizens acquired some freedom of speech and press to discuss Stalin’s problems. The famine was discussed OPENLY AGAIN in
                Gorbachev’s time, who personally suffered from hunger during the collectivization period. It wasn’t disguised in the 1980s, it was analyzed FOR THE SECOND TIME. This is the period when I went into these events in depth,
                because data was available, and it was of topical interest.
            </p>
            <p>
                The current claims of 20 million deaths is ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS, and cannot be abided in an environment of academic honesty. It is MAKING A MOCKERY of other mass-murder claims, and it shows a level of DISHONESTY and
                STUPIDITY in regard to analysis of government data that has not been seen since before the 20th century.

                The number of Ukrainians that disappear is the order of 5-7 million, this is a census dip, an includes migration and prevented births. The population figures do attest to a tremendous amount of suffering, which is indicative
                of extreme economic hardship and famine, partly deliberately inflicted by Stalin’s policies.
            </p>
            <p>
                But DISHONEST IDIOTS take the process which eliminated 11 million kulaks and produced 10.5 million former-kulak collective farmers and state laborors, and call it the EXECUTION of 11 million kulaks. This is INTOLERABLE

                Well, I think that kind of statement is not controversial, except inasmuch as it can be read as praise. Thanks, but I mostly just used my potty mouth here, not much more. I’m not asking to change people’s minds on authority,
                I don’t have any. I am asking for people to read the debate, and make up their minds after reviewing the issues, after reading related material they feel is relevant, and after hearing all the various arguments, as best they
                can. Or perhaps not, and then just to leave it alone, and keep a mind as open as they feel appropriate.

                It is difficult to evaluate things without knowing basic stuff, but I think you are overestimating the barriers of education today, when you have plentiful online resources. While it is true that in the past, the access to
                education was limited, with only a few people in universities having access to the best up-to-date literature, now that access at the ordinary undergraduate level is universal, and either today or very soon, with the opening
                of the scientific literature, it will be completely universal at all levels, even the most cutting edge. Anyone can read anything now., u
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you have access to literature, education is mostly a matter of being pointed to the right stuff to read and review, to a quick summary in case it is unduly long or arcane, and to the right fora to get answers to the
                questions that arise when reading it. I think that this barrier is relatively negligible today for anyone under the age of 30, certainly as compared to when I was growing up. Young people can find and read literature very
                quickly. Once you do this, you can check any claims for yourself, so long as you have enough intellectual honesty to evaluate claims with less and less of a bias.

                With this model, expertise becomes widely diffused, and the role of experts shrinks dramatically— you don’t have to look to an expert to be told what to believe, and the public can serve as a check on the experts, in those
                not so rare cases where the experts are totally wrong and maintain consensus by authority. These are the most dangerous cases.

                That doesn’t mean everyone in the world can evaluate a proof in algebraic geometry, but it means that someone who has a need to verify such a proof doesn’t face an impossible barrier to doing so, and the class of people who
                have acquired the expertise is not controlled by gate-keepers who only let the right sort of people in.

                there’s only one side pushing back, and in these cases, you get monstrous errors due to people following self-interest. Believe me, it is not in my self interest to explain the honest estimates of Soviet death. If I just
                said “Stalin killed 20 million” or better yet “Stalin killed 60 million”, I would get absolutely no trouble, and if I wrote a book that said this, I would get on TV.

                The Soviets were EXTREMELY HONEST internally regarding production, because they had all the documents. The KULAKS were not LIQUIDATED by TAKING THEIR FOOD, they were liquidated by confiscating their farm, and then taking
                their production, and they would the be expected to join a Kolkhoz and get their wages and buy their bread at the same government store as everyone else. They didn’t have enough to buy in the early 1930s, because Ukraine was
                undersupplied, but the famine’s effects were not as lopsided as made to appear in the West, and regions abutting the Ukraine suffered too, although perhaps not as harshly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The LYING consists of DISTORTING THE NUMBERS to say 20 million or 60 million died. TO CLAIM THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE LIQUIDATED WITH ALL THEIR RELATIVES AND THEIR EXTENDED FAMILIES AND THE EXTENDED FAMILY BEYOND AND SO ON,
                RECURSIVELY, IS BEYOND PREPOSTEROUS, IT IS COMPLETELY INCOMPREHENSIBLE STUPIDITY. I CAN’T EVEN BELIEVE ANYONE WOULD SUGGEST THIS WITH A STRAIGHT FACE.

            <p>
                I can do the Holocaust estimates on Jews using this method, a typical surviving Polish family lost 70% of members, and this is all survivor bias, because a lot of families were liquidated entirely. But the estimate comes out
                ballpark right, as it does for Hungarians, for French, and so on. You can, simply by examining family history, get an ORDER OF MAGNITUDE ESTIMATE, and this allows you to know which of the detailed historians is telling the
                truth.

                I don’t expect ANYONE to trust me! I HAVE NO AUTHORITY, AND NOBODY ELSE DOES EITHER. I expect anyone interested in this to look up the Ukrainian and Soviet census data, to examine the arguments that people made for 3 million
                deaths, 5 million deaths, 20 million deaths and 60 million deaths, to ask a dozen or so Russians and Ukranians to tell their family stories of the period, and to CONCLUDE AFTERWARDS that the true number of famine victims is
                between 2-5 million, and NOWHERE NEAR 20 million.

                Yes, yes, you LYING MONKEY. The way it works is this— five good historians, usually left-leaning, study the details of the Soviet Union, and give you accurate “low-ball” estimates. Then come a bunch of bourgoise writers and
                “historians” who create numbers out of thin air, to advance their own power. Then you publish a “list” of all the opinions together, and I AM SUPPOSED TO TAKE ALL THE ESTIMATES SERIOUSLY?? GO SUCK YOUR BALLS. I KNOW HOW TO
                ESTIMATE INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY OF THESE JERKS, AND I CAN TELL WHO IS RIGHT.

                YOU MUST NEVER MAKE AN AVERAGE OF THE TRUTH AND PROPAGANDA, BECAUSE PROPAGANDISTS EXPECT YOU TO DO THIS, AND ADJUST THEIR PROPAGANDA ACCORDINGLY. You don’t take estimates seriously when they conflict with carefully compiled
                population statistics, done region by region, over many decades, and over several changes of governments, which are consistent with each other and which are consistent with observations and external CIA estimates. The
                Soviets didn’t lie too much in their five year plans either— the statistics for production quotas were manipulated to look good in ways OTHER THAN lying about quantity of production. The “lies” about Chernobyl are simply
                slow announcement, due to official embarrassment, it took a day or two too long. The response was entirely appropriate once the government was active, the Soviet Union in 1985 had an entirely responsible relatively open
                government for the first time, certainly more responsible and open than the nightmares that people have now in that region.

                You simply have no idea what internal gosplan documents looked like, you never read them. You never looked at the discussions of party officials, and compiled statistics, and planning figures, and I have (they are boring but
                extremely informative). There can simply be no fudging when you are planning an entire economy, as you have people accepting deliveries on each quantitiy you produce, document and send off. The fudging comes in the ignoring
                of needs you didn’t anticipate, and in overproducing certain goods that you know about at the expense of others you are ignorant of.
            </p>
            <p>
                You ALSO have no idea what a death rate of 20 million looks like in a country of 160 million. It’s a CATASTROPHE you cannot miss. It’s deaths all over, it’s numbers appropriate to the black plague. You would see mass deaths
                in nearly every family, it is a HUMONGOUS rate of death, it would be impossible to miss, and you would be able to see it by a small random sample of Soviet citizens. IT SIMPLY IS NOT THERE. IT IS EMBARASSING, OBVIOUS,
                POLITICAL, LYING. An easy question you can ask: “did more relatives of yours die as combatants in WWII or from political repression under Stalin?” You can easily find the answer to this without any experts to help, and the
                WWII deaths are compiled independenly, we know exactly what these were.

                Another source of economic error came in the black market and small farming, stolen goods, etc, and this hidden economic activity was biggest in the 1970s and early 1980s. It goes above ground in 1985 with Perestroika, and
                in the last years it is regulated business activity, and it is estimated properly. THERE WAS NEVER POPULATION FUDGING, as nobody cared to hide anything, nor could they even if they wanted to, as the figures were compiled in
                many offices region by region.

                The “dekulakization” was the process of confiscating property, it removed a social class of peasants. It didn’t proceed by killing all the kulaks and their relatives, but by removing their property, and arresting or killing
                those who resisted. These are included in the judicial and extra-judicial executions compiled by honest historians. It was socially unsettling, and led to the loss of property by millions of people, but not to their deaths,
                as you can see BY SIMPLY ASKING PEOPLE WHOSE RELATIVES OWNED PROPERTY. The result was TURNED INTO MASS MURDER BY LYING MORONIC PHONY HISTORIANS IN THE 1990s, rather, I should say, to GREATER mass murder than the ALREADY
                TERRIBLE repressive executions by the hundreds of thousands. It was known what was going on in the early 1930s outside the Soviet Union, the process was widely denounced in Western media, and collectivization led to
                hard-to-estimate famine deaths in the way it leads to drops in production whenever it is tried, as for example it did in China, Yugoslavia, and elsewhere. Yugoslavia reversed collectivization after less than a year, and
                farming output rebounded immediately. Cuba never even collectivized the farming because they learned from this terrible experience. In the US, the large factory farms have a similar drop in efficiency compared to small plots
                farmed individually, but the arable land is larger, and the privately managed factory farming was significantly more efficient than state farming. This was Gorbachev’s specialty, he was a specialist in farming and a
                specialist in Ukrainian production, as this is what he did in the planning days. He also saw firsthand suffering from hunger in the 1930s, and had firsthand experience with collectivization.
            </p>
            <p>
                The famine was real, people went hungry, including a young Gorbachev, but NOBODY HAS GOOD ESTIMATES for the death toll, the death toll is estimated using the dip in the very same census data that you are MORONICALLY
                contesting. Death tolls in communist famines involve fewer direct victims of starvation, because the distribution of food is relatively uniform and there is access to medical care for those who succumb to hunger or disease.
                The 1940s Dutch famine is an example where a capitalist country successfully mitigated mass deaths by enforcing an equitable distribution of the much-too-small supply of food. The Soviets could not be as good as the Dutch,
                but they were better than England and the Irish. My personal estimate, coming from MY ASS, is that between 2 and 3 million people died directly as a result of the collectivization famine. This is reasonably consistent with
                the demographic declines of the early 1930s. It COULD BE HIGHER, but I TRUST MY ASS OVER ANY ESTIMATE COMING TODAY, because of the RECURRING DELIBERATE OBVIOUS LYING REGARDING ALL THIS STUFF. You can’t trust people in the
                field to be honest anymore, let alone a mentally defective pontificating philosopher who never did any deep random sampling survey of mortality rates from various causes in the early 1930s nor ever made a consistent picture.

                Six million Jews were not killed, four and a half to five million Jews were killed, and a couple of hundred thousand died from typhus in addition. These are the Jewish organization estimates from 1945, these are the numbers
                you find from population census figures, and this is what is consistent with the deportation records and testimonies. The general rule is that the closer you get to the events, the better the estimates become. The Soviet
                famine figures and the Soviet camp deaths were estimated many decades, before and after the archives opened, and the stories were always consistent, until, in the 1990s, in a spate of popular books, SUDDENLY THEY BALLOON TO
                20 MILLION, THEN 60 MILLION!!

                WHAT KIND OF MORONS DO YOU TAKE PEOPLE FOR? THE BIG NUMBERS FOR THE SOVIET UNION ARE MENTALLY RETARDED MADE UP LIES BY WORTHLESS IMPOSTERS WITH A POLITICAL AGENDA, LIKE YOU. They are stupid, they are impossible, they are
                academically criminal, they are unworthy of respect.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way in which these numbers are produced and percolate is A DISGUSTING SHAMEFUL STAIN on the modern academy, and it is precisely for this purpose that the internet was made, to CORRECT this lying, as I am doing now,
                without giving them ANY SHRED OF RESPECT, just tearing them apart mouth to anus, claim by claim, like the Jewish center ripped apart the holocaust deniers.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is one of the worst ACADEMIC DISEASES in academia today, it is a REPULSIVE SELL OUT of monstrous proportions, and one must not be complicit with it in the least, as it is WORSE THAN HOLOCAUST DENIAL, because unlike
                holocaust denial, holocaust fabrication is something DECENT STUPID PEOPLE GO ALONG WITH. It is a deliberate distortion of history designed to bury the study of the history of half the world in a mountain of bullcrap.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is also why holocaust denial must never be made criminal, as any restrictions on speech always eventually make it impossible to get at historical truth. The FABRICATION of 20 Stalin MEGADEATHS is actually a great weapon
                in Neo Nazi propaganda, because they say “See! Look how easy it is to create a genocide out of thin air”. Of course, it is not, because there are ASSHOLES LIKE ME contesting it, who will CONTEST IT TO THE GRAVE.

                You stupid twit, the population census figures for the Soviet Union were ALWAYS HONEST AND RELIABLE, unlike your INSIPID INSINUATIONS, these figures were used for everything from labor apportionment. industrial relocations,
                planning for industrial cities, they were central to the process of planning, and these people took their planning seriously. You are now disputing the SOVIET CENSUS? What data don’t you dispute? You retarded ape. Give it
                up. You’re just blowing rhetoric. It doesn’t work online.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were those who were killed and those who were released. YOU CAN ASK ANYONE IN THE FORMER SOVIET UNION. The answer is always the same. Everyone was scared, there were two relative who got in trouble with the
                authorities, one who was arrested and released, sometimes one executed. That’s typical, and it’s consistent with the numbers I give. The emigrees are OVERREPRESENTATIVE of the repressed people, as they consist of
                bourgeoisie. The mass of people just went about working trying to make the best living they could under the system, without making waves, and that 99% was left entirely alone. The problem is that among the HIGHER UPS, the
                only “people that count” in the views of Western media, the persecution rate and execution rate came up to 16%, and among the top of the top, the revolutionaries of 1917, the rate of execution was 50% or higher. It is all
                consistent with what I told you, because what I told you is the GODDAMN TRUTH, and truth doesn’t change.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were no mass executions of entire families, the persecution in the Soviet Union was ALWAYS individual, with good party members in the same family as persecuted dissidents. The only family that got killed were the
                Romanofs. Famines don’t work the way you are claiming, they don’t claim families, they claim individuals who succumb to weakness and disease, and young children, who are neglected due to weakness. You are simply a LYING
                FRAUD, and I don’t have patience for anything you say anymore. Go live in your own universe, leave the rest of the world alone.

            <p>Yeah, yeah, nitwit, sometimes the deniers are just objectively right, which is why you need to do a review in all cases.</p>
            <p>
                In the case of the USSR, the mainstream deniers are 100% right, the ones that don’t dismiss Stalin’s democide as propaganda, but dismiss the recent inflation of those numbers as propaganda. These folks use official figures
                to compute what was happening, and they are doing good historical work. The other side just pulls numbers out of the ass, and does so to make the average bigger than Hitler. There is no methodology to the 60 million figure,
                it’s just designed so that the average with 2 million, with weighting, will converge to approximately 20 million, so that Stalin will be “worse than Hitler”. It’s that moronic, and it is deserving of no respect. So ptui on
                YOU, twit, you are condoning historical LIES which are designed to block honest scholarship and dismiss honest historians into the margin. There is no excuse for that.
            </p>
            <p>
                The evidence is not only from official speeches, it’s from the population figures, from a random sampling of individuals that were arrested and either executed or served their time (I know many physicists who went through
                this in the Stalin era), and asking people from the Soviet Union which of their relatives died.
            </p>
            <p>
                NONE OF THESE are compatible with 20 million death toll, NOT ONE. They all point to a 2-3 million death toll, consistent with the population statistics, and compilation of executions. The compilation of execution figures has
                been done using post-Soviet figures from previously classified archives, and I trust the careful historian’s modern figures of ~700,000 executions in Stalin’s era (I didn’t know these were available), with perhaps a
                comparable number in the later Stalin years, but no more.
            </p>

                The demographic figures for the Ukranian famine are much harder to come by, and here you need to sample Ukranian families to know. You simply cannot trust anyone on this, because THEY ALL LIE THROUGH THEIR TEETH, without
                conspiracy, simply by repeating Solzhenitsin, because this is how you get attention and money.
            </p>
            <p>
                But given the acceptance of the famine in Khruschev times, we can know that there was a serious, serious death toll here, and I trust the demographic estimates of 5-7 million lost Ukranians in the 1930s, although this
                involves lost births as well, so the best estimate of the true death toll is on the order of 2-4 million. I don’t know what it was exactly, because I can’t trust the writing of anyone on this, because it is corrupted by
                propaganda, and influenced by the desire to produce as big a number as possible.

            <p>There are two different kinds of atheism: scientific atheism and anti-scientific atheism, and they usually comprise two completely disjoint sets of people.</p>
            <p>
                Scientific atheism is the rationalist science folks, who object to supernatural nonsense, and they identify religion with supernatural stuff. These people generally continue to accept the non-supernatural consequences of
                monotheistic religious thinking without knowing the religious pedigree of these ideas. They accept the equality of humanity, the sanctity of individual life, the abhorrence of slavery, the humanist notions of progress and so
                on, without associating these with the text of the Bible.
            </p>
            <p>
                The anti-scientific atheism is aware that these conceptions are due to monotheistic religion, and seeing that the scientific atheists have weakened the supernatural basis of the claims, they then try to substitute other
                quasi-religious but non-monotheistic claims instead of traditional monotheistic religion. This is the program that Nietzsche started, Heidegger continued, and the post-modernists picked up on. They used it to justify any
                position which stood in contrast to the religious tradition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Religion, when you look at it deeply, is not about supernatural nonsense. That’s what it claims in its founding texts, but these supernatural stories are ultimately irrelevant to the practice of the faith. The basic notion
                is instituting superrational decision making, and for monotheistic religions, it is to extend the superrational decisions to all humanity. Superrational decision making looks superficially collectivist, although it is also
                informed by individual intuitions, and it forms a conception of an all intelligent super-duper mind that is aware of everything everyone does and wants everyone to be good.
            </p>
            <p>
                This meta property of superrational collectives is what the religions are decorating up with supernatural window-dressing. It has nothing to do with miracles, nor does it have anything to do with science. It is about
                constructing a consistent all-encompassing superrational ethics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The science-atheists generally accept the superrational ethics without question, as it is deeply socially embedded already, and react with horror to the abuses in atheist states like the USSR, or the worse abuses in
                Nietzschian states like Nazi Germany. They do not understand what religion is, and they attack the parts which are worthy of ridicule, the nonsense supernatural stuff. That stuff is just propaganda tacked on to a social
                system, it is not at all what the system of religions are about.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Heideggerian atheists understand the purpose of religion and attack it at the base, by replacing the thinking with a self-consistent non-monotheistic conception. This is a comprehending attack, and it is much more
                credible. The supporters of post-modernism distrust monotheistic religion because they distrust tradition, and that makes sense. But one should understand the monotheistic insight indepedently of tradition, by understanding
                superrational decision making, and the universal concept of God, without relying on historical texts or made-up miracles. There are enough non-supernatural real miracles, like eliminating slavery, and instituting science, to
                establish the superrational monotheistic conception on.

                I DON’T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT YOUR FAMILY. I have a grandfather brutally enslaved and starved by the Nazis and large chunks of murdered family including people who fled under piles of corpses. What difference does it make? I
                still verified the assertions of genocide objectively, by READING AND UNDERSTANDING THOSE GODDAMN NAZIS, and TAKING THEIR PHILOSOPHY SERIOUSLY, to see what exactly they were thinking. Individual suffering has nothing to do
                with academic truth, academic truth is much more important, since academic honesty is the best way to prevent future suffering. Understanding what was going on is the only way to prevent such horrors from recurring. Any lie,
                even a “noble lie” is a crime against the literature.
            </p>
            <p>
                The current propaganda claims about the rates of state murder in the Soviet Union are a MADE UP FANTASY, which is good, because it lets you identify dishonest stupid academics like Hicks. The claims that stalin killed 16% of
                the population is patently absurd, let alone the recent claim that he killed 50% of the population. He can only have been responsible for 3% at most, because you don’t see the effect on total population figures. The
                repression was terrible, but that doesn’t mean you get to LIE ABOUT IT. Tell the truth, it was bad enough as it was.

                I never use ad-hominems against a person who isn’t using various anti-logical rhetorical devices. It’s just that I MAKE IT OBVIOUS, by calling you a crapstain, while you MAKE IT SUBTLE, by using a high-falutin tone and the
                dismissive annoying language of authority. IT DOESN’T MATTER WHICH YOU USE, BECAUSE BOTH ARE EQUAL IN PROPAGANDA VALUE. Once there is enough ad-homs and ridiculous rhetoric flying around on all sides, all the anti-logical
                arguments become completely irrelevant, on both sides. When you force people to pick sides in a conflict, they will either butt out entirely, or they will review the objective evidence.

                Hicks is also an idiot (funny enough, I just read his stuff, as he has an attack on post-modernism from a traditionalist liberal point of view). He is writing explicitly anti-socialist texts, which in itself is not a
                problem, but he makes the following outright OUTRAGEOUS ERRORS:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. He claims Stalin is responsible for 60 million deaths in the Soviet Union, a country of ~200 million people, and ~120 million in Stalin’s time. This figure is the latest upswing from Solzhenietsin, to 1 in 2 Soviet
                citizens dead under Stalin, the previous figure was 20 million, or 1 in 6 Soviet citizens dead (in addition to the ~12-15 million war casualties). That’s really awful, the way the population of the Soviet Union declined by
                50% as Stalin murdered every other person, like Hitler did with the Jews. You can see it when you ask typical Russians or Ukranians about their familiy, half their family disappears in the 1930s, just like typical Jewish
                families in the 1940s.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course not! That’s obviously ridiculous, and from a survey of former Soviet citizens, or a glance at the population statistics for the era, the rate of death is about 1%-3% at best. Hicks buys this MENTALLY RETARDED
                bourgeoise propaganda without any critical review. Stalin’s “purges” usually involved firing people from various positions of power, only the most powerful or top people were executed, but these are the most visible people.
                These purges were AWFUL, but the result was on the order of 300,000 deaths, as revealed in the Khruschev era. There were on the order of 2-3 million imprisonments, with a mortality rate in prison of order 10-30%, and you can
                do the math. These are roughly comparable to the cumulative suffering and death from street homelessness in the US, although I am not condoning either of these horrific endemic structural democides.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Ukranian famine killed at most on the order of 3-5 million folks, it is hard to tell, because this is a demographic estimate, so it includes babies who were not concieved. The net total of deaths in Stalin’s time from
                state repression is best estimated on the order of 2-3 million people. The loss of life in the 1920s civil war was higher, and the loss of life in the Irish potato famine, a similar disaster due to liberal capitalism, is
                higher still, and from a much smaller initial population. I am not white-washing Stalin’s very real crimes, I am trying to show you what THESE ACTUALLY WERE, instead of doing propaganda for liberalism.

                The same estimate inflation works for Mao. Mao’s famine killed less than it prevented births, because food was relatively equally distributed outside of certain areas where people misreported needs, as is usual in the
                stupidity of central planning. The demographic dip in China amounts to ~30-60 million lost people, but these nearly entirely consist of babies never concieved. You can see a similar but smaller dip in the US during the years
                of the Great Depression. The baby-boom is a reaction to this, people put off having babies until they were economically secure. I am not condoning Mao’s crimes either, which were very real. I am telling you what they
                actually were, rather than doing liberal propaganda.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not defending Stalinism of Maoism, I am attacking Stephen Hicks, for uncritically repeating propaganda. This is common now in anti-intellectual circles, and it is always rewarded. Online, it is extremely easy to fix, I
                just did so. To verify these assertions, you need to look at the actual content of Khruschev’s 1956 speech, and the actual demographic estimates for China’s terrible times in the 1960s. These were terrible enough as they
                were, without lying.

            <p>2. Hicks claims that the Soviet Union economic output was roughly comparable in 1917 and 1956, that there was no significant economic growth.</p>
            <p>
                This is complete MADE-UP NONSENSE. The Soviet Union industrialized in the first and second five-year plans, from ~1930 to ~1940, literacy rates went to 100% in this period, and the last unemployment office was closed because
                unemployment had dropped to 0%. The reason unemployment was at 0% (it really was) is because the Stalinist hiring model paid managers by the number of workers they could attract, and had a free labor movement, with prices
                set by supply and demand. It was secretly a pure free market, and the pressure was to get every worker into a position. This continued through the 1980s, and unemployment was at 0% or as close as one could measure,
                throughout the period. But the supply/demand wages led to weird phenomenon, like factory laborers making twice as much sometimes as professors or managers, putting pressure on people to fill what are lower-paid positions in
                the west. This created a huge amount of resentment, because more powerful positions were lower paid, but it is consistent with the predictions of an idealized frictionless liberal free-market model for labor, which is more
                or less what was instituted in the second Soviet constitution.

                The way Hicks shows no growth in the USSR is by comparing farm output in 1917, when nearly the entire population was farming in small plots, to 1956, when the farming was done with a small percentage of the population in
                collective farms, and the rest worked as industrial workers. This is an insane economic comparison, and dismisses the many-fold industrail growth in the Soviet economy during the 1930s and 1940s. The USSR had double-digit
                growth rates until the 1960s, which is why Khruschev predicted that it would eclipse the west. The rate of growth was roughly equal to the west in the 1960s, and stagnated in the 1970s and 1980s. The end of communism was
                marked by a 50% collapse in the GDP of the USSR, as the state industries were privatized, and cooperation agreements with Eastern block countries collapsed. The USSR’s economy was approximately 30% to 50% of the US’s during
                the 1950s-1970s, with a similar population. It never caught up, but it wasn’t anywhere near 1917, it industrialized and educated the whole population. It also was completely competitive in the hard sciences, and about 4-5
                years behind in electronics development. This lag only became intolerable when personal computer technology was developing, because 4-5 years in computers is an eternity.

                I am NOT ADVOCATING USSR STYLE SOCIALISM. I am advocating ACADEMIC HONESTY. If Hicks can’t even be bothered to get his figures right, rather preferring to repeat figures pulled out of the nether-regions of propagandists, how
                can he discuss these issues objectively?
            </p>
            <p>This type of dishonesty is used by the media as a marker— it tells you who you are supposed to pick out the “great philosophers” now. The great philosopher is the one who goes along with the currently accepted propaganda.</p>
            <p>
                Still, I mostly agree with Hicks in his analysis of Nietzsche and post-modernism, but he is not intellectually honest, as is revealed by him swallowing absurd mass death figures for communist atrocities without actually
                checking the figures for himself, and by completely misunderstanding the structure of the Soviet economy and the growth rates of this economy in its prime.

            <p>3. He associates post-modernism with the left, even though it is a creation of the fascist right.</p>
            <p>
                Post-modernism was ping-ponged between right and left, because it is essentially an ATHEISTIC philosophy, denying the notion of truth. It has nothing intrinsically to do with the left. It was due to Nazi Heidegger, and it
                was mostly embraced by right-leaning German intellectuals.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was taken over by the left because it gave a framework independent of tradition for discussing religious notions. But there is a much better framework for this which is monotheistic, in superrational decision making. This
                is actually monotheistic ethics, with a notion of a personal God, and this is what I go by. So I can ignore all post modernism completely.

            <p>“Not exactly” is irony-talk for “COMPLETELY 180 DEGREES REVERSED”, I guess I have to clarify for the irony impaired.</p>
            <p>
                Heidegger is a moral stain and a vacuous idiot, Neitzsche is a terrible crackpot, and I have no patience for academic philosophy, as aside from the short lived logical positivist movement, it is all a terrible intellectual
                fraud. The continental school has produced nothing of value aside from Marx, who was really an economist and not a philosopher, and all the rest can be condensed into a five page summary which would be hard to fill without
                redundancy.
            </p>
            <p>The points of agreement you see are superficial:</p>
            <p>1. the ability to formulate a new position and maintain it in the face of hostile propaganda.</p>
            <p>This is something that the post-modernists encourage. It is also something science encourages. The critical difference being that you go with the new position only as far as it is correct.</p>
            <p>2. The willingness to use anti-logical arguments, like ad-hominem and propaganda</p>
            <p>
                This is a superficial point of similiarity. The crucial distinction is that these ARE NOT ARGUMENTS AT ALL. These are simply used to diffuse and counteract the propaganda value of authoritative bullcrap, which usually comes
                in the form of an equal amount of veiled or explicit ad-hominems and anti-logical argument on the other side.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any logical argument proceeds in parallel to the ad-homs or anti-logical rhetoric and has no relation to this anti-logical nonsense, little idiot. You can remove all the ad-homs, twit, and the content is unaltered,
                prickface, and consists of a normal rational discussion of the usual sort, testicle-brain.
            </p>
            <p>3. The dismissal of authority structures.</p>
            <p>
                This is the sole point of agreement with the post-modernists. The difference is that one is beholden to the same standard of truth that has been understood since ancient times, now bereft of social authority, proceeding with
                as many as desire to join, without any barrier to entry, without any barrier of unduly obfuscated language, and with the text itself, judged by independent analysis, shared and evaluated by textual responses being the only
                acceptable method of arbitration of acceptance or rejection. No socially mediated authority required. That’s not postmodernism exactly. That’s internet discussions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The philosophical underpinning is totally different. There is no rejection of truth here, no rejection of logic, and no rejection of fact or placing discourse above content. It’s the exact opposite, it is simply a rejection
                of traditional authority. And that’s not post-modernism. That’s Galileo and Pauli.

                With that way of thinking, “right” and “authority” become synonyms, and truth is simply a social process of consensus. This is the Heideggerrian view, and it is simply false, and even a small amount of experience with the
                hard sciences shows you this. The Copernicans were right long before they were accepted or even gaining converts rather than losing them. Archimedes was right 1800 years before he was completely understood. Cavalieri was
                right even though he was heckled and marginalized. The process is exposed in a very clear way in mathematics, and in science, because the people who are right are, by statistics, nearly always very different from the people
                who are powerful, and this is why studying physics, engineering, computer science, etc, is important for clarifying social processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the case of social questions, there is a view that these more difficult to analyze things do not have an objective truth to them, they way chemistry does. The notion of religious teleology (or teleology of truth) gives a
                definition of “right” here also: right is that which people eventually come to agree on. Eventually leaves a long time for discussion and debate, and the mechanism is a long consensus-forming process which examines all the
                various arguments one by one. This process produces authority at the end, but does not require authority to operate. It only requires intellectual honesty. This is different from the Heideggerrian definition because the
                structure of the discussion process itself is important, the structure of the debate informs you whether you can trust the consensus that is produced from it. Pontification from authority doesn’t help sway things one way or
                another, at least given a long enough time. Open discussion is foolproof, because no point of view can be shut out, except those points of view that nobody thought of yet, but these are quickly produced when people sit and
                think for a little bit.
            </p>
            <p>
                The example of science is useful, because here you can verify the truth of the propositions for yourself, completely independently of the social process, and then check how long it takes for the parallel social process to
                work itself out, in this case where there is a nearly purely individual method of evaluating true and false. You learn that it does work itself out, but it takes forever, and the length of time is contingent on all sorts of
                events in history, like which nation won a war. But in the end, the person who got it right, in the sense of correct mathematics and science, always is eventually authoritative. And for the handful of examples where this
                fails, the person usually gets some small thing wrong that blocks the acceptance, like Geoffrey Chew, or else the idea is just on the way up, like Hugh Everett III. In either case, the internet makes the process go by an
                order of magnitude faster than before.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mechanism of social progress requires freedom of participation, tolerance of wrong ideas, examination of all related ideas without bias, and relentless intellectual honesty, so that you point out your own mistakes FIRST,
                before other people do, and you don’t feel bad when you get something wrong, rather, you learn something. These are the principles of physics discourse, and they are very alien to social politics, where you are supposed to
                simply twist and bend every statement and fact to your maximum political advantage. The zeroeth approximation to physics discourse is to bend and twist every statement and fact to your maximums DIS-advantage. This is what
                people are free to do on online forums without repercussion, because you can do so anonymously and remotely. It produces physicist-level of clarity, but too few people do this right now.
            </p>
            <p>
                Online forums don’t exclude billions exactly, although if you are talking about rural electrification in the Sudan, you might be missing some voices, although you would be surprised at how resourceful 10,000 people are at
                finding at least one linked in representative. The real exclusion is of the second fellow with the same idea, as repetition is a waste of time, so the first person who has something to say sort of owns it, and needs to
                defend it, because everyone else with the same point of view doesn’t want to duplicate the effort.

                The principle is the same, he is a socially powerless nobody who is being attacked by a wealthy person who has lots of power and no achievements. These malcontents are extremely jealous of people with no power and real
                achievement, because they think “it’s not fair! I worked hard for all this power, why can’t I do anything significant?”, the world’s smallest violin providing a soundtrack for their sorrow. Nobody corrected it, by the way,

                the mistakes where I am wrong, which wasn’t in too many places (you were more wrong more consistently, and you never corrected anything, because you are not trained in intellectual honesty). I think I did an excellent job

                The main message is the same now as at the start— this is an unjustified hit piece on a non-threatening nobody for the purpose of silencing internet discourse, and it should not be accepted at face value. There’s nothing
                wrong with me saying stupid things along the way, based on false assumptions, so long as a correction doesn’t require too long a process. It doesn’t. Me saying stupid things neither hurts nor helps my credibility, because,
                and this is what you don’t get, ONLINE THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS CREDIBILITY, only the text matters, and people verifying various statements for themselves using the nebula of online resources all around us. A person who
                makes three correct statements and one outrageous WHOPPER doesn’t lose credibility, the three correct statements are verified, and the whopper is corrected, and nobody has any more or any less credibility at the end than at
                the beginning, no matter who said what. But the truth becomes clear to everyone along the way.

                It isn’t a social process, anyone can do it if they have the time and energy to post original material and follow the discussion, which in this case, I took time to do, because this cause is important to me. My long-winded
                posts are required because others are either deliberately lying or doing propaganda, and the point of this is to demonstrate that these are useless, as one person doing counter-propaganda without listening can easily
                counteract fifty or a hundred doing propaganda the other way. So best stop doing propaganda unless you are right.

                the text matters. The only reason I am motivated to post long material is because I am right here, so I don’t have any worries about acceptance. That comes slowly at best, when you are right, as people slowly think about
                things themselves. As for “no one listened”, that’s just more propaganda, as I can see that due to my verbal diarrhea there is no more consensus here, some people got tired of arguing and left, and I got some hate-messages

                I have to agree with you completely regarding post 1300 Christianity, it backtracked on this accomplishment in a shameful and reprehensible way, and forgot its founding purpose. But this is a perversion of the intention of
                the aims of the religion. The perversion in the US in Mormonism is especially pronounced, but in all Southern denominations it was perverted in the same way, to claim that it encourages unlimited chattel slavery. Chattel
                slavery is what Christianity is designed to eradicate, and it worked nearly as well as Judaism eradicated it in Judea in an earlier era. while it worked in the transition from ancient times to midieval times, it stopped
                working in the modern era, both because it was splintered, and also because Popes were always on the side of power.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not a Christian, or an idealist, I just try to give credit where credit is due. The transformation away from ancient majority chattel slavery is clearly Christian, as it happens simultaneously with Christianization,
                although at a glacial pace.

                That’s not a “secret doctrine”, that’s a structural property of nearly all movements that become powerful, with the best exception being modern liberalism (although this becomes violent too in America in suppressing Shay’s
                rebellion, and other monetary insurrections). There’s relatively little of that in Christian history as compared to previous ancient history, precisely because the major doctrine opposes violence. But there is still some,
                because there is still power, and where there is power there is violence. The imposition of opinion is at first voluntary when the movement is weak, as it has no other choice at this point, and then looks for excuses to
                become violent when it is the majority opinion. This violence is what modern liberalism is designed to counteract, by imposing individual freedoms. It has nothing to do with any secret violent teachings, these are just not
                there in Christianity, any more than Jews have injunctions to slaughter non-Jews and drink their blood.

                Not exactly “NA NA NA”, more like “come back when you have more intellectual honesty”. Ok, you are acknowledging the main slavery reforms now, although I would prefer it if you say outright “Chrisitianity was a slave
                revolt”, because that’s exactly what it was. The emancipation is the main reason people go around revering Christmas all over the world, more or less as they revere a Juneteenth.
            </p>
            <p>
                The doctrines about slavery you are talking about are crazy isolated exceptions to the otherwise universal rule of emancipation, and they are analogous to debt-slavery in Judaism, and I don’t know anything about them, nor do
                I care about these details so much. I accept that there is a complicated dance of pro and anti slavery forced through the early midieval era, but but you must also accept that a doctrine that frees 99.9% of all slaves and
                puts the remainder under conditions of non-absolute non-generational servitude cannot be considered “condoning of slavery” in any form. It is an abolition of ancient slavery, replacing it with various forms of penal slavery
                and debt-slavery used to enforce social law.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ancient widespread majority slavery is beat back to the point where it is an extremely unusual condition, essentially abolished among the Christian populations of Europe. The condition that you can own non-Christian
                slaves is not as much a problem as it seems, at least not in the midieval era, as this does not lead to generational servitude, because of conversion. That is, it doesn’t lead to generational servitude until people run away
                to distant colonies and import large numbers of non-Christian folks to serve as slaves without emancipation on conversion, or create protestant Churches which temporarily turn away from the doctrine of liberation. It’s
                analogous to the doctrines of ancient Jews, which also required emancipation upon conversion, but it was not a problem among the Jews either, as male children of slaves must be circumcized, allowing for easy conversion, and
                the practical result of Jewish law is that ancient Judea is free of the scourge of absolute generational servitude, probably quite a while before the Babylonians invade, and certainly before the Romans come. This doctrine is
                what distinguishes monotheism from other practices, any religion that led to ancient slave emancipation is more or less monotheistic.
            </p>
            <p>
                I agree that the modern emancipation is more total and more permanent than the first Christian emancipation, because it is enforced by anambiguous secular law and unmodifiable religious decree today. But the religious
                emancipation of the early middle ages more or less removed slavery from Europe entirely. The abolitionist interpretations of Christianity are dominant through Europe until modern times, they are only perversely interpreted
                as condoning slavery in the Confederate south, and this is not a Catholic doctrine, those people are all Protestant and make up their own slavery-condoning denomination. The slaves in the South, although largely illiterate,
                still picked up on the purpose and message of Christianity, pretty much only the slaves (and the abolitionist northerners) understood what it’s all about, and embraced it more than the slave-owners in this period. To this
                day, the African American community is very committed to Christian religion, and this is tied to the recent experience of servitude.

                Christian slavery of Christians is removed in Christendom by explicit Church decree in the 7th century, which is before 699, not 604, although slavery was already rare (perhaps extremely rare, I don’t know) in 604. The
                declines in slave population is, according are supposed to begin in the 3rd or 4th century, as I suppose is estimated from estimated economic data, I don’t care, as all I cared about is the approximate slave population
                numbers. I found the name of the church fellow who pushed through the abolition, but it is also clear from the socioeconomic changes and political system changes that this is the end of a long process and not a sudden thing.

                The SECOND slavery abolition in the 18th century, and 19th century is abolishing the SECOND period of slavery from ~1250-1865. This is three times further removed from ancient slavery in time as we are removed from the
                second abolition. I explained this to you several times, but you are obviously decided you would rather dogmatically play pretend games online to avoid losing face.

                This is complete nonsense. There has never been an abolition of slavery which did not involve an institution outlawing it explicitly, and in the case of 7th century Europe, the institution was the church. I gave you the
                doctrine, it’s explicit 7th century Catholic doctrine that Catholics cannot own Catholic slaves, and it is effective, in that there are no slaves anymore. It is also clearly an implicit doctrine earlier, going all the way
                back to the beginning, although it is also not enforced in strict law, but in convention. Onesimus became a bishop in the Church, this is something that comes up later. We know he does not remain a slave. The epistle is
                abolitionist through and through, although also pragmatic about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea that the collapse of central authority led to emancipation is ridiculous, as slave-owners simply do not retain authority over their property through a central authority imposing it, rather through local authority
                using taskmasters with access to violent means of repression. The emancipation is directly as a result of the Church injunctions against slavery. The same is true in Judaism, but much earlier, as the Jewish religion
                emancipates all slaves after a fixed period, and that’s that, a law on temporary slavery eliminates chattel slavery in less than one generation, as slaves convert to Judaism, and then the Jewish slaves become Jewish
                freedmen.
            </p>
            <p>
                The collapse of Roman institution is the result of the decline in slavery, not the other way around. The whole Roman economy is built on the labor of slaves, and as the slaves become serfs, the centralization of the slave
                economy around the decisions of slaveholders collapses. This collapse is ongoing in the 4th-6th centuries, and it is essentially total by the time the dark ages begin. This loss of financial power weakens the military. There
                was nothing else going on except Christianization that weakened Rome to the point that it allowed the invasions other than the loss of the powerful slaveholding class. It doesn’t matter so much by then, because power has
                devolved to the Church.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the main point of Christianity, and you miss it. Serfs were now beholden to secular royalty granted by local kings, and the royalty was held in check by clergy from doing things like reinstituting slavery, and all
                the private large slaveholders are history. That’s the Christian revolution, and it’s Christian. It’s annoying that you are blind to this, as it is the single most significant transition in human civilization.
            </p>
            <p>
                I should add that this emancipation process was completed in Israel first, where slavery was not a permanent institituion, at least not in the era of Priestly Judaism and Leviticus law. Jews were nearly all free in Palestine
                before the Babylonians and Romans came, they lived as autonomous agents with occasional 6 year bondsmen to repay debt, and a full reset of the financial system every 49 or 50 years, in the Jubilee. Being universally free and
                universally literate, of course they resisted external occupation worse than anyone, and Christianity eventually exported the same freedom outside of the confines of Judaism. They left the Jews alone because the Jews weren’t
                the ones enslaving them.

                Outright slavery was abolished in Catholic Christendom in the 7th century, there are no more slaves in Europe by that time. The modern slavery and the slavery on the periphery is something different from the main bulk of
                Catholic Europe. I am not sure about the Eastern Orthodox history, they might not have abolished slavery.
            </p>
            <p>
                The freeing of the slave is strongly encouraged by the letter, if you actually READ IT, the social equality of slaves in the Chruch is definitely explicitly stated, and Paul takes upon himself the debts of the slave, and
                asks Philemon to consider that he owes all his soul to Christianity, and to consider this price against the price of the slave’s debt. It is accepted in Catholic tradition that Philemon freed the slave, the same slave
                reappears later in the New Testament as a Bishop, and I don’t think he was moonlighting as a Bishop and a slave by day. It is clear from later Catholic doctrine that slavery became unacceptable, and you can’t falsify this,
                because this is the major historical break between slave economies and feudal economies.

                St. Paul would not agree with the confederates, but it doesn’t matter. I am not advocating theocracy here, I am just objecting to falsified readings of the purpose of Christian religion. I am more a humanist myself, but I
                try to be honest about the history.

                I do keep telling you so, but you keep asserting the opposite without any evidence. The military events and the conversion events are largely separate, and the imposition of Christianity is through a social dominance process
                which is violent only after it is already dominant.

                anyone else. NOBODY disputes the nonmilitaristic interpretation, it’s just something snarky atheists point out.

                Sorry, you have no idea what you are talking about, and you are repeating Confederate stupidity regarding Christian history. I reviewed the material yesterday, the review did very little, it just shifted the dates of
                emancipation around— I thought slavery was totally eliminated in the 6th century, and it was actually eliminated in the 7th.
            </p>
            <p>
                The major role of Christianity, and the largest factor making it spread was in gradually abolishing the institution of slavery. There’s a reason people count the years since Jesus’s birth, and it’s nothing to do with
                miracles. Slavery was completely abolished throughout Christendom by the 7th century, a process which began with the spread of Christianity and dramatically increased as the Christian reformers started to have an influence
                on secular policy, and instituted ethical reforms. It becomes an explicit injunction in the Church to disallow Christian owning Christian slaves past the 7th century, and Europe was entirely slave-free between the 7th and
                12th century. The 13th century slaves were Muslim, and the Muslim slaves pollute Europe with this again, but the institution was never all that widespread like it was in the colonies, and it is banned through secular
                legislation in the European countries that reinstated it in the 19th century.
            </p>
            <p>
                What you are right about is that there was some debate in the early Church regarding slavery, the religion wasn’t uniformly abolitionist, although it was egalitarian. The debate lasted a long time. Still, the emancipatory
                character of the religion is there right from the start, it is in the decrees of equality of Christians, and it applies to slaves (and freeing them) explcitly in the Epistle to Philemon and the Catholic tradition regarding
                Philemon freeing his slave. The canonization of the Epistle is controversial, either because it is too abolitionist in sentiment or not abolitionist enough, but there is an explicit denouncements of the slave trade in Paul,
                and .explicit recognition of equality of slave and master to make abolition inevitable, and the process does complete, although in geological time frame.
            </p>
            <p>
                The statements of St. Augustine are coming in the 3rd century, before the religion is established enough to do the major reform. There were high-class fellows in the Church, who as always, have no clue about anything, and
                want to maintain class priviledge. There was a debate about the character of the church in the canonization era, but you can see that the abolitionism stayed, because it completed. There were those who suggested the Jewish
                method of limited slavery, but the outright abolitionists won out.
            </p>
            <p>I should say that Jews also abolished slavery outright in this era, although when they did it, I don’t know.</p>
            <p>
                It was not an official policy until the 6th century or 7th century, but it is codified in Catholic doctrine that Christians may not own Christian slaves explicitly the 7th century, and abolitionism is the only real secular
                point of Christianity.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are speaking about Confederate interpretations of Christianity ignoring the real historical purpose. I don’t have any patience for this, as you are totally wrong. My “guessing” (which is just mental shorthand for
                previous reading about this) is completely historically accurate. Please don’t continue with this intellectual dishonesty, and review the real church policy on slavery properly.

                These are ridiculous Confederate Southern misinterpretations of the purpose of Pauline teachings. Do you really think that those Southerners understood the purpose and principles of Christianity? Don’t you think they were
                reading in their self-interest?
            </p>
            <p>
                The type of chattel slavery these southerners condoned was the kind historically removed by Christianity. It is contrary to the traditional understanding of these verses to read them as condoning slavery, although that was a
                common Protestant misreading in the colonial era, for obvious reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paul returning Onesimus to Philemon is NOT an example of Paul condoning slavery— it is an example of how Christianity deals with master/slave conflict and the justness of freedom for the slave. The slave and master are first
                to be reconciled, they become brothers in the Church, and then with enough time, the master sets the slave free because it is the right thing to do (or usually more accurately, as a result of a significant social shaming
                process if he doesn’t).

                Sorry, you are just missing the whole point of the Christian revolution here. Christianity discouraged Christians from holding Christian slaves, all Christians were brothers and sisters in the church, and a socially enforced
                loose condition for joining was emancipating the Christian slaves you owned, on your own schedule, but it was a process that was definitely going on, because widespread slavery is replaced by a different economic order in
                this era.
            </p>
            <p>
                You freaked me out, so I just looked it up, and it’s in the same exact Pauline epistle, the Epistle to Philemon. You should read it properly. Philemon is the Christian slaveowner, Onesimus is the fugitive slave. Paul has to
                decide what to do regarding Onesimus. Onesimus is returned to his master, Paul obeys secular law regarding slavery, but at the same time Paul exhorts Philemon to treat the slave not as a slave, but as a brother in Christ,
                and insists that they are social equals (I read this on Wikipedia just now, but it is what I remember from the New Testament). Then the master frees the slave, and they are both canonized.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s not like the Church handed out Sainthood for no reason, this is what the main teaching on slavery was, as I understood— the masters will eventually join the Church through social pressure, as the empire is
                Christianized, slaves join the church automatically, they come first. Once the master and slave both join, they are social equals in the Church, and the expectation is for the masters to gradually emancipate their slaves,
                without coercion, or legal obligation, just as a sign of sincere Christianity.
            </p>
            <p>
                I should point out that this is exactly analogous to the Jewish religious emancipation, where Jews are required to free Jewish slaves after 7 years of bondage. Except, being Christian, it doesn’t go by a strict timetable,
                and it’s more of a wink-wink nudge-nudge social compact than a rigid law (as is the spirit of the religion— the expectations for behavior in Christianity are enforced by shaming and collective will, rather than by written
                law).
            </p>
            <p>
                This kind of excruciatingly slow emancipation is in conflict with the desire of abolitionists, so the texts are ambiguous on the subject, in the sense that revolt is discouraged, but at the same time emancipation is
                encouraged. The exhortation to obey your masters I read as an exhortation to not make revolution, but to wait for the process to complete of its own accord, as it did, over 500 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                The effect of this teaching is that as Christianization proceeded, the slaves would be freed gradually, and the slave system was replaced by serfdom and artisan labor, with political heirarchies of land-owning and
                serf-control through nobility grants from the local secular authority. The Church’s role was overruling secular policy it felt was not consistent with Christianity, so like a presidential veto plus a supreme court. This is
                the Feudal system, and it is a different economic order than the Roman slave system, where slavery was basically total and unlimited.
            </p>
            <p>
                You were completely inverting my own memories of reading the New Testament and related historical materials, but I read only enough to form this basic picture, as this transition I was not so interested in. I was genuinely
                mystified at how you could come to this interpretation of the Christian slavery teaching, but I think I understand now. You are reading it based on the completely wacko interpretations of these teachings in the American
                slave era. I do not believe I am the one deluding myself here. Christianization was a real slave revolt, and the most successful one in history.
            </p>
            <p>
                This doctrine was flexible and did not enforce things by decree and certainly not by direct armed revolt, but the slave system was replaced by a serf system in this time through Church action, and this is gradual and clear
                because you can see large slaveholding construction projects stop dead, and the whole slave economy collapses. Where did all the large slaveholders go during the dark ages? What happened to the slaveholding dynasties? They
                were all gone by the 7th century as every slave was freed or died.
            </p>
            <p>
                The slavery teachings are simply not encouraging a slave revolt, rather emancipation through gradual Christanization of the whole empire. If I am wrong about this, please let me know, because otherwise I can’t understand the
                massive social upheaval that accompanied the Christianization of Rome at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern slavery, the 18th and 19th century kind, was historically disconnected from the slavery of Rome. It began with slavery of Muslims and other non-Christians in the late midieval era, and continued with slavery in
                colonial regions. As I understood the events, there are two completely distinct slave-phases, the Roman one, where the majority are slaves and they are largely of the same ethnicity as the masters, and the modern slavery
                where a minority are slaves in remote regions, and this minority is foreign and of a different ethnicity. As I understand, the two phases are not connected by any direct historical line of slave-owning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, the readings of these doctrines and texts were perverted and inverted in the American slave era, as I understand it, to understand these gradual abolitionist sentiments, which freed the ancient slaves over geological
                time, to instead imply that slavery is just and proper. The readings are not consistent with the interpretation of the texts in their Roman context, and really, the feeling of Northerners that Christianity and slavery are
                just incompatible was wholly correct.

                It is not true that each denomination recognizes a different interpretation of these gospel quotes. They all interpret it as a struggle for dominance, without bloodshed, by conversion. Besides, Christianity was under unified
                leadership at that time, it hadn’t split into denominations yet. That’s the standard interpretation, and it is universal as far as I know, certainly today, and I don’t see evidence that it wasn’t universal in the past. Your
                examples are just not persuasive.

            <p>
                Relative peacefulness is exactly what it was. The transition was Constantine accepting Christianity by a slow conversion process in discussions with one of his family members who was Christian, and then some time later
                another emperor making the religion the official state religion. That’s what happened, it wasn’t a violent revolution in any sense.
            </p>
            <p>
                The persecution of pagans was a component too, after the Christians were dominant, but, really, the pagans had propped up the slave system of Rome for centuries, I hate to say it, but they really had it coming, and
                persecuting them is no more unusual than people persecuting Nazis today (although we are more civilized about it). The pagan system in Rome justified slavery, murder of slaves in arenas, horrors you can’t imagine.
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn’t conquest, it was social pressure to convert, and directed localized killings at best to remove Pagan strongholds that resisted Christianization. It wasn’t a bloodbath like Masada or the conquest of Jerusalem circa
                66AD, and although I don’t support this kind of thing, it was better than what was going on before.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think you are trying to read in violence into one of the most peaceful revolutions in history. You can see the same thing again in the conversion of the Germans, in the conversion of the British, the Irish, and so on,
                there are a dozen or more examples of Christianizing revolutions. Each of these followed the same pattern, proselyzing, conversion, slowly working up the power structure until the leaders capitulate, and then cleaning up the
                residual paganism by social coercion and a small number of executions at best. That’s the standard pattern, and I don’t believe it was any different in the Roman Empire.

                I get your point, and it is interesting, but I can’t agree that it was falsified, the pacifism is a major doctrine, and the relative peacefulness of the Christian revolution, as compared to say, the Spartacus revolt, or the
                Jewish wars, attests that it was not a false front. The vestigial remnants of militarism in the gospels can be considered a hidden coding of some lost original militaristic teaching, but I think it is a mistake and a
                disservice to the text. I think any military references are always better thought of as an explicit metaphor for the coming spiritual battle. Even the “sell your cloak and buy a sword”, and it is not to be interpreted
                literally, but in the same way all Christians have standardly interpreted it.

                That’s a very violent interpretation of Christianity, and it does not describe other post Constantine events very well. For example, the Colloseum was closed when a martyr stood up in protest, and was killed by the mob,
                leading the authorities to shut down the place. Christians brought the religion to Germany, to England, and to Ireland, then to Poland, and Russia, and so forth, and these people were powerless in the new lands, and were
                persecuted like the Church founders were. This is not the kind of action you expect from a vengeful Christian victory, it wasn’t a military action or an action of the sword, rather the same kind of actions which are
                consistent with previous martyrs, following the letter of the gospels.
            </p>
            <p>
                The deaths of the Mithraic priests are historical, but I don’t know what happened there. When you say “Christians did it”, it is not clear that it is the Church itself meting out a death sentence, or whether it is a lot of
                former slaves doing terrible things to their former masters, as often happens in any successful slave revolt. Same with Hypatia. These pagans were likely slave-owners, and Christianity was a successful slave-revolt, where
                the slaves become free. the scholarly stuff was destroyed by those who were destroying the slave system, same as the classical art and classical culture.
            </p>
            <p>
                I see it from a different perspective, which is more Marxist (but Nietzsche also saw it this way, he just didn’t like it). The revolt here is the elimination of the Roman slave-master system, with the creation of a sort of
                egalitarian brotherhood of slaves, which is then reinforced by religious terror from a political organization, sort of like modern Marxist states. The terror was towards those who supported the old order, and the terror was
                ruthless toward the masters in a similar way to how slavery was ruthless toward the slaves. It’s like the terror in Russia, or in other communist states, which was directed at those who in other societies would be members of
                the bourgeoisie. Their plight is more visible, as they are visible members of society, while the plight of slaves was about as worthy to record as the plight of homeless vagabonds is today.
            </p>
            <p>
                The collapse of the slave system just destroyed the old economic order of Rome, so that the enormous construction projects could not be done, the precision sculpture could not be made (which incidentally suggests to me that
                the precision sculpting was done as grunt-work by slaves from body-casts, not by an undocumented army of ancient Rodins from their imagination), the libraries could not be maintained outside of Churches, and the old
                doctrines of master superiority over slave were removed, and anyone who supported these doctrines was a target. The whole system collapsed, and the dark ages means that even high-class literacy was gone, leaving only Church
                literacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t see this as the Christians now doing the same thing when in power, because these power structures just absolutely needed to be removed, otherwise we would still be living in a Roman style essentially Nazi slave
                state.
            </p>
            <p>
                The real terror here during the midieval era was the suppression of individual initiative, much like in modern Marxist states. Anyone who wanted to do an individualist project, like Marlowe writing great plays, is considered
                as an atavistic throwback to the Roman masters, and shunned by the community, and is only accepted back if they accept the authority of the community and the communal values that are shared since the Christian revolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Protestant revolution allowed a certain amount of individuality in Christianity, modern science restored not even Roman science (which was atrocious) but previous Greek science and extended it tremendously— the
                suppression of honest science was in my opinion the greatest problem with the church, and Capitalism allowed the division of labor found in master/slave societies to be reestablished within a more egalitarian system, but
                still not very egalitarian. But this partial classical restoration in the 1492-1992 bourgeoise era also lead people to consider Christianity as an imposition of slave-order on the powerful, and there are people who always
                want to be able to own others and impose their will through force and violence, something against which Christianity puts a good barrier.

                Ha Ha, yes, Disqus doesn’t understand the subtlety of “rooster”. Sorry for “you didn’t read the gospels”, I see you did, and I appreciate the independent interpretation. But I think you were looking at it the wrong way,
                looking to extract a historical interpretation out of it by interpreting the events causally, and I think this is largely a mistake, because there is no independent solid description of any historical events that led up to
                this, and they are not necessary. I take it as a snapshot of the spiritual doctrines of the time when they were written, not as any kind of accurate description of any historical events that led to this doctrine, which are
                lost to history.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t consider the gospels as a reliable historical record, any more than I consider, say, exodus as a reliable historical record. When you try to figure out what could possibly be the historical events behind the text,
                you are doing something other than reading the text and extracting the spiritual guidance that it is giving, and you tend to focus on incidental passages, like “sell your cloak and buy a sword”, rather than the main message
                in the text.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Peter treif-picnic may post-date the crucifiction, but is pre-dates the writing of the gospels, so all that it tells you is that acceptance of Jesus is not dependent on accepting Mosaic dietary law, which just lowers the
                barrier for the religion to spread.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am projecting this “back” to Jesus, because the texts were written after all the events were already complete, so they are made self-consistent teleologically by the chroniclers. I don’t consider them to be historical
                record in any form sufficiently unaltered to divine what actually went on in the sense of historical fact, so I read them as a unified spiritual whole, with backward and forward influence, like Exodus back-influences
                Genesis.

                I don’t like to dispute these, as I don’t support these folks, and I despise Bush II more than any other president, but I really think these are arguable, even though Willie Horton has become a staple example of
                race-baiting. The content of the ad is Duakakis supporting prison furloughs in Massachussettes, and really it would have worked equally well against Dukakis if Willie Horton had been white and otherwise all the same. I agree
                that the imagery in the ad was pure race-baiting, that the wording and imagery was playing to racist fears directly, and it was reprehensible. But dude. Prison Furloughs? For lifers? That’s a really stupid idea, and it looks
                like a legitimate attack, if it were done without the racial aspect (just removing Horton’s photo would have been sufficient).
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t believe that the racial undertone had anything to do with Bush I as a president, and I am not sure if he was competent to understand the significance of this stuff beyond the surface level of the ad. He wasn’t so
                subtle. The surface level is fine, it’s an attack on a stupid policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway It is obvious from his appointments and supported legislation that as a leader his racial stance was not out of line with the mainstream today. It’s a terrible ad, but the race baiting aspects are overemphasized in my
                opinion. A more legitimate example of race-baiting I think is Reagan’s welfare queen in a cadillac, or starting his campaign in a confederate stronghold. Reagan did race-baiting more than the Bush’s, and I don’t think it’s a
                coincidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                The black disenfranchisement in the election of Bush II was racially discriminatory, but in my opinion it was not particularly racist (I know it sounds like a contradiction in terms), not like housing discrimination, or
                education funding discrimination, or segregated schooling is racist. This was a pure deiberate disenfranchisement of most likely Democratic voters, like ballot stuffing in 1964 for Kennedy, and it did not have the same
                racial impact as race discrimination per-se. It was opportunism. I do not consider it a racial attack, but a (highly illegal) political attack using voting statistics to identify populations whose disenfranchisement would
                impact the opposing party. The neglect of the population after Katrina I do not think is about race at all, rather about class, the rich people in New Orleans wanted the poorer folks removed, regardless of race. The wealthy
                folks in the higher area neighborhoods New Orleans were diverse too, they weren’t all white. I don’t support any of this nonsense, but it is simply not true that either Bush was a racist, it simply doesn’t pass the smell
                test.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for the links between Bush and the Neo-Confederates, it is true but it is as understandable as the link between Obama and Bill Ayers, or marijuana clubs. You don’t control everyone you support, and you sometimes support
                those who help you without supporting their position. Also, Bill Clinton’s “Sister Souljah” speech was race baiting in a worse way than any of the Bush material, but he was not criticized for it, because it was clearly
                political opportunism, and his policies were good for racial harmony.

                That’s them trying to exploit racists for political ends, like the Democrats try to exploit drug use for political ends, it’s not them accepting racism as a principle. The Republican party tried to appeal to racists in that
                period, but that really was never that strong an appeal, and it ended with Bush I and Bush II, they were not racist at all, and both have serious non-token African American appointees (Bush I had Colin Powell, Bush II had a
                whole bunch). Further Bush I understood the principle of civil rights well enough to push through a serious expansion of the notion of what civil-rights bill can do, extending the concept to actually disabled people. this

                It had most to do with Einstein being right about relativity. It’s more interesting when it goes in the other direction, where the side that is crushed militarily and politically is the one that is right. For example, with
                regard to Gentzen, who was a German starved to death after the war, and who had the right position regarding the Hilbert program. Hilbert died (of old age) during the war. In this case, Godel fled to the US, and Godel’s
                position that there can be no good consistency proof of arithmetic was dogma in mathematics until today. But with a little bit of explanation, you can counteract this political disease and show that Gentzen’s position is
                right. Gentzen’s position was also close to Turing’s, but Turing postwar is outed as a homosexual and driven to suicide (or perhaps dies accidentally, maybe he was even murdered, although that looks unlikely), and also
                Alonzo Church, but he dies too. So there was no strong counter-push to Godel politically. So what happened? Did Gentzen get suppressed forever? No. There are mathematicians who advocate his program of ordinal analysis today,
                including Rathjen at Leeds, and I try to do propaganda to get this injustice reversed. Staying in Hitler’s Germany does not mean you don’t know math. A similar example is Teichmuller’s work on his eponymous spaces, which was
                underground for decades, although I believe he was an actual Nazi.

                Neo-Confederacy is a political movement, and politics is not so different from how science proceeds. There is a truth here too, but a more vague ethical truth, and the processes of history reveal it also, and it is
                irreversible ratchet. That’s the “historical God”, and it’s a part of monotheism too, that’s probably the most distinctively Jewish part, and it’s not a false proposition.

                I am sorry, you simply have not read the gospels at all. There is no way in heck that any of that stuff can be read as a preparation for a military revolt. The whole point of the crucifiction is that Jesus was NOT engaged in
                any military anything, he was completely innocent, he didn’t do anything except troll the empire.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Jewish revolt of 66 AD was JEWISH not Christian, the Christians weren’t in Palestine at the time as far as I can tell from any reliable historical record, they were all in Rome. This revolt had nothing to do with Jesus,
                it had to do with the Jewish interpretation of messiah at the time, which was the leader who would overthrow Rome by force of arms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jesus, as far as I can see, is more a vague amalgalm of various people than a person. He’s a prototype for martyrdom and resistance. There’s much of James the Just in Jesus, a little of John the Baptist, those are definitely
                historical people, and maybe there was another person named Jesus too, although that is not strictly necessary for the religion to work. You are trying to read in a historical Jesus into the documents, something that
                contravenes the purpose of the text, which is to replace the miltaristic doctrines of messiah with spiritual doctrine of messiah. The text is a REACTION to Jewish militaristic interpretation of messianic doctrine, it is
                saying that messiah is a spiritual term, not a military term, and the victory does not come on a literal field of battle. This is the WHOLE POINT of the texts, and it is not only accepted by Christians, it is also accepted
                by Jews past 135 AD, when Rabbi Akiva and all the others are martyred.
            </p>
            <p>
                This new interpretation withstood history. Ben Gurion, who actually “liberated Palestine for the Jews” is not identified as a “messiah” in any Jewish religious text (although some secular Jews proposed that he should be so
                identified), simply because he is a secular political leader, not a spiritual figure. The interpretation of the term changed, and the Christians led the change. The change is there from the beginning, and any militaristic
                sentiment you read into the gospels is your own insistence on falsely reading made up history into (reasonably good) theology.
            </p>
            <p>The Jesus followers were nothing like the Manson followers, as they were all Greek, and mostly outside of Palestine, and they did not support militaristic resistance to Roman rule.</p>
            <p>
                I strongly disagree with your painting of the events in the gospels as preparations for military revolution. This is just what non-Christians or atheists do when reading the text without understanding. The texts were written
                in the 2nd century, and are not celebrating the end of a failed revolt, but the beginning of a successful one.

                It’s science, other people’s opinion are simply not important. Only the instrument readings and calculations are important in evaluating a proposition, and for most of my original stuff, so far so good. It is really useful
                to know that there is someone who finds it unconvincing, because if there weren’t it couldn’t possibly be new or interesting. The evaluation of a new scientific proposition is by testing it as objectively as possible, not by
                listening to the mentally defective people in positions of authority.

                Look, there was opposition to the theory of relativity in 1920, and it involved powerful people. They kicked out Einstein and instituted German physics. Then in the 1940s they went underground. By 1960s, there was no
                opposition to relativity except for cranks. The Confederacy is dying, let it die, there will always be cranks.

                “I bring not peace, but the sword” is not talking about cutting people, it is talking about talking, and the context is unambiguous about this. The sword is pitting mother against daughter, father against son, and brother
                against brother, at the DINNER TABLE, in the struggle to convert them to the new faith. This is likened to a sword in the passage, it is discussing the schism that Christianity will bring in society. This is also discussed
                here:

                There is no dispute among Christians regarding the meaning of this verse (nor can the meaning possibly be disputed by any person who is able to read and reads the chapter). There is not a SINGLE Christian denominational
                interpretation of this verse as militaristic, it is only thought of this way in ignorant people who are skimming the New Testament, and are snarkily looking for a contradiction or alternative reading which in this case does
                not exist. Jesus never advocates military struggle or violence in any form, and none of the Christian texts are about violent struggle (although they are about a struggle).
            </p>
            <p>
                The actions of Jesus in overturning the money changer tables are symbolic of nonviolent protest. There is no real implied violence towards any human being, still it is not a passive action. The point is that Jesus is not an
                authority of any kind, and has no power to get the money changers out, nor is he a man who has any ability to harm them, except symbolically.
            </p>
            <p>The basic tenet of Christianity is the destruction of authority by contrarian action which opposes the authority. This is a form of trolling.</p>
            <p>
                If you would like to see more exampes of trolling by Jesus:<br />
                “Are you king of the Jews?” “You said it, not me.”<br />
                “Shall we stone this woman?” “The one without sin can throw the first stone.”<br />
                “Why do your disciples eat treph from the field?” “Are you complaining that God made it so?”
            </p>
            <p>
                etc, etc, really pissy annoying answers, classic trolling. The whole of the gospels are a blueprint for effective trolling, and this is why I was inspired to read the whole thing, and why it was moving. It is clearly a
                description for how to challenge power effectively, with martyrdom accepted as the price.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s the essence of what Jesus is all about, nonviolent trolling, accepting that the consequence is potential violent reprisal, and letting yourself take that risk to produce a better world. This is why trolling must be
                preserved. It’s how you produce progress.

                Hitler is about thuggery, and the resuscitation of the Roman empire, and natural law of strong oppressing weak. This is the opposite of the CORE TENET that makes Christianity Christianity, (ignoring metaphysics, since
                religious metaphysics is always purposefully stupid and nonsensical). The Roman natural law order is opposed permanently and consistently, at all times, by all denominations, without exception, except perhaps Mormonism which
                I am not familiar with. These things are simply not fungible, if it doesn’t oppose the Roman style order of natural law and hierarchies of humanity, it just shouldn’t be called Christianity.

                I read EXACTLY THAT STUFF in der-Sturmer. Oh I see. I said “They didn’t use criminality in their propaganda”, I meant by that “They didn’t use criminality in their sincere propaganda, the stuff I said— stab in the back,
                Jewish weakening of German morals with weakness, Nietzsche, that’s what they used to get sincere people to join the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                That stuff in Sturmer is not what you normally call criminality. It’s fantasy crime, and the association with Jews was fantasy writing. The propaganda was real, but it was just like “The Weekly World News”, it wasn’t about
                real-world events. There were no jewish ritual murders, there were no jewish white slavers (nowadays it’s called “human trafficking”), it was all fantasy for the readers, like the Weekly World News in the US, which served a
                similar role at attacking the public’s brains, minus the genocide.
            </p>
            <p>Your quote “But the Nazis used the theory of “collective guilt” to try to round up and execute ALL Jews for the “criminality” of which only a few were actual examples”.</p>
            <p>
                This is a problematic quote. That’s not what was going on at all. They did not round up and execute Jews for criminality in any way shape or form, this is for sure incorrect, I know, because I know how propaganda is made.
                That stuff was nonsense which slowly, slowly, gets the public at large on board with the genocide, and it had zero influence on Nazi policy, which wasn’t decided by polling the public, but from the top down.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Nazis were NOT sincerely blaming the Jews for any actual crimes, Sturmer wrote over-the-top stuff like this “Jews EAT JonBenet Ramsey, use blood for Matzos”, to get the public to hate the Jews through this reasoning:
                “Well, they didn’t eat JonBenet Ramsey, but they sure are wicked anyway, and I’m sure they had SOMETHING to do with the dissapearance”, etc. This is the propagandist method, it has nothing to do with any actual Jewish
                criminals, none of which I ever saw in derSturmer. It simply wasn’t about ordinary crime, like a crime novel is about crime.
            </p>

                I think Streicher should not have been executed, he should have been imprisoned instead of the rank and file SS (and the rank and file SS executed). He was the Rush Limbaugh to the Nazi’s Dick Cheney, he had no influence,
                and he had nothing to do with policy. He was also a boor, and the Nazis had nothing to do with him, he wasn’t a high-class guy like they were. He was just a guy they hired to slowly chip away at the public’s opinion of Jews
                and communists, by creating such extreme hatred, that more mild but still extreme hatred became the compromise position, and the norm. Because people usually make their opinion by weighted average of everything they hear,
                and it requires serious counterpropaganda to undue this natural tendency.
            </p>
            <p>That counterpropaganda is what I am doing here. I am simply removing all the Streicher-isms by adding Streicher-isms going in the other direction to neutralize them.</p>
            <p>
                The only way Streicher style hatred becomes a social disease is if it only comes from one direction without neutralizing counter-propganda. In the 1940s, the communist partisans produced high quality counter-propaganda
                against the Germans, and unlike the Germans, they didn’t focus on imaginary sensationalist crimes, but on very real ones.

                I am not talking about Jesus or even Paul, I am talking about the basic point of Christian church teachings as understood essentially from the beginning until now. These teachings were designed to create martyr actions which
                would topple Roman naked absolute power, and place the church as an ethical guide above the power of the state. It’s sort of like the communist party placing itself above the state in Russia, this is mideval theocracy,
                except not totalitarian, in that individual political leaders only looked to the church when they did something objectionable, and the Church ensured they lost support.
            </p>
            <p>
                The doctrines are of complete equality of all humans who accept Christ, of all Church members, of a non-specific non-tribal deity you are supposed to export to everyone in the world, of denying worldly power, and of
                spiritual resistance to barbaric cruelty by examples of martyrdom. These are the fundamental tenets.
            </p>
            <p>
                To say Hitler said “Christ” is meaningless if the fundamental tenets aren’t there. The fudnamental tenets in Hitler are replaced by Nietzschian ones, of strength, and Christ becomes the “god of whites”, instead of a
                monotheistic “God for all humanity”. That’s a subversion of all previous Christian teachings, there can be no debate over this. There was not a ton of debate about this in Hitler-times either, the sincerely religious people
                didn’t feel he was one of them, and the White Rose consisted of some Christians in Germany, however few of them were left.

                Yes, the proportion of those people has fallen to a point where their presence has negligible political impact. I know it doesn’t feel that way when they are so threatening and hateful to blacks in America, and one must
                always be vigilant, but the Confederate symbol was removed from the flag in Virginia and there are no more obstacles to Martin Luther King Day. The South is shedding its neolithic confederate heritage, and the atrocious
                blind defense of that wretched heritage in media which used to appear everywhere from “Birth of a Nation” to “Dukes of Hazzard” is now completely erased. You don’t find any positive representations of confederacy or the
                confederates anymore, and they are always a political liability. They aren’t all dead yet, but under these political circumstances, it won’t be long. They certainly are nothing to worry about today, although one must always
                keep vigilant, you are right, in case they ever start to get positive mention again.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reenactments are not sympathetic to the confederacy in general, although they used to have this flavor. Now they are more a way of keeping history alive. I don’t think you can ignore the change in the South in the last
                30 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, these neanderthal Confederates are not the source of Republican appeal, or there would be zero membership in the Black Republican Caucus. The appeal is class inequality, and the doctrine of the superior person,
                independent of race or gender, just by virtue of the “Will to Power” that you need to rise up the ranks in politics.

                They did not use criminality to justify their policy, it simply was not a justification in their propaganda. It doesn’t appear anywhere as there was no fear of Jewish gangs. Their propaganda image of Jews is of a scheming
                sexless physical weakling, not a street thug. I’ve haven’t seen a reference to what we normally call criminality in the propaganda, although I only read a little of der-Sturmer, so if you know examples, please tell me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jews in 20th century Germany were assimilated, they didn’t live in isolated Ghettos, they spoke German fluently, they worked in the professions, and they were completely integrated in day-to-day life and were not on the
                whole extraordinarily socioeconomically disadvantaged, although they were underrepresented in the high German bourgoisie. This assimilation and normality is why the genocide came as such a brutal shock, because it was a
                demonstration for many that assimilation of Jews in Europe is simply impossible, and even if theoretically possible, too risky to continue.
            </p>
            <p>
                The propaganda made Jews out to be vermin, and the “crimes” were not street crimes, like mugging, but crimes against Germany. There were other crimes too, like absurd slurs about Jewish incestuous behavior, ideas of corrupt
                morals (meaning having sex with Germans), and ideas of spreading degenerate art (meaning Picasso and Jazzz). Perhaps regarding the Picasso and Jazz business, some Jews have to plead “guity”, and I’m sure that some people had
                sex every once in a while outside of ethnic boundaries. But the decadent morality assertions, the incest, the cheating, was simply an old anti-semitic trope used to prop up the new anti-semitism.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main crime here was God, imposing a religion of weakness on the strong. There was also the imagined crimes: the “stab in the back” of 1918 causing Germany to lose the war (a similar stab-in-the-back motif appears in
                American films regarding the Vietnam war, except this time blaming Hippies, not Jews) of inspiring Britain to declare war on Germany, and the other imagined crime of having set up the Soviet Union (although here, there were
                disproportionately many Jews in the politburo in 1917, this was all over by 1930, as Stalin purged all of them, and in Soviet Communism in the early era, being Jewish or Chinese, or whatever, didn’t make any difference. It
                still usually doesn’t, although it did under Stalin).

                No, the answer is always what I said, up to a small error, at least for any recent battery (excluding old batteries that had hysteretic charging effects, althogh in principle, the law also works for those batteries too, if
                they are always fully discharged before they are plugged in). The ambient temperature does matter a little bit, but not very much, and it affects the 90% and 10% charging time equally, so my question was just fine as stated.
                You are just making excuses for not knowing the first thing about the most basic scientific processes, something which should clue you in that perhaps there’s something wrong with your brain, and certainly that you should
                leave commenting on scientific matters to your betters.

                Do you know what the battery charging law is? It’s very useful for your day-to-day life, and it’s known to all freshmen engineers and all physicists as a seat-of-the-pants intuition that just comes. It is completely unknown
                to everyone else for some reason, it is especially mysterious to the lizard people such as yourself.

                It’s something my father, who is an engineer, told me how to estimate, and I slapped my forehead and said “of course”. It’s not in any course as far as I know, it’s not in any book, it’s not dependent on the battery, and
                it’s something you can’t look up anywhere. It only depends on general properties of batteries and general physical intuition. To help you along, the answer is about 3 minutes and 50 seconds.

                There is nothing to concede. It took me forever to realize that you are likely the same person as the author of the article, because you disguised it. So I took “Raven’s opinion” and “Karen’s opinion” to be two separate
                opinions which were strangely always aligned, and Raven as strangely knowledgable about all of Karen’s details.

                You are the same person, so your opinion is not independent, it is worthless as a data point regarding the threat women feel online. It was also intellectually dishonest to have pretended like this. It was also damn gullible

            </p>
            <p>There is something called “stress” in the boxes, don’t get scared, “stress” means “force”. That’s just the same as there is stress in the core of the building.</p>
            <p>“Stress” is another word for force (technically it’s force per unit area, but the areas and details are irrelevant here), and force is, by Newton’s definition, the rate of flow of momentum from one body to another.</p>
            <p>
                Momentum is a thing, like water. The flow of momentum is exactly analogous to fluid flow, whoops, I’m sorry to bring up fluid flow, except that unlike water, momentum can move nonlocally, meaning that a far-away thing can
                push on another far-away thing, transferring momentum across a distance. In this case, the only force of this kind is gravity, with the Earth pulling down on the boxes, or the buildings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let me call up-momentum positive, and down-momentum negative. That means a stone going up has positive up momentum, and a stone going down as negative up momentum (I know it’s confusing for a lizard, but try to concentrate).
                The way a building stands up is that negative up-momentum (i.e. down-momentum, i.e. weight pushing down) comes in from the Earth directly into the thing being supported, that’s the weight force of the object, and then up
                momentum flows up through the struts from the ground, cancelling it out. That flow is like a closed-circuit of momentum, the up momentum is flowing up from the ground like a geyzer (again, fluid flows, sorry) and
                disappearing by jumping into the Earth nonlocally. That’s how Newtonian mechanics describes a standing building.
            </p>
            <p>When you cut the struts, the circuit is opened, and the down momentum accumulates in the body. Then the body falls. The rate of accumulation of momentum is constant, and the body falls at freefall.</p>
            <p>In a building like the world trade center, the core is transmitting stress. The same is true for cardboard boxes sitting on a table. When you have damage, a part of the building can collapse, some parts can fall over.</p>
            <p>But there is a strict principle— in order for the thing to fall down at free fall, there has to be exactly zero stress entering from the supports.</p>
            <p>
                The way that the World Trade Center fell is that the collapse started at the point of impact, and the building fell down at the fastest possible rate, except for the inertia of each floor. What that means is that the
                building lost all support instantly the moment the collapse front reached the next floor, and the momentum in the collapsing section was distributed to all the mass of the collapsing section and the new stuff it just picked
                up, which wasn’t moving to begin with.
            </p>
            <p>
                I simulated this process, and, exactly as NIST say, this produces the right time for the collapse (I forgot the figures they said, but the process of collapse of a uniform building with inertia as the only thing holding you
                back is about 30% longer than freefall).
            </p>
            <p>
                This model is accurate. What it MEANS is that there was no stress transmitted up through the core when the building collapsed. The core simply stopped working as a support structure when the building began to collapse, it
                was as if it had disappeared into thin air.
            </p>
            <p>This is simply unprecedented. It is impossible that the core disappeared just like that.</p>
            <p>
                Further, the problem is worse for WTC building 7, because there, the building just fell at free-fall, which means that all the supports disappeared AT THE BASE, not step by step, there was not even accumulating inertia
                slowing the building down. Building 7 is a no-brainer, it is obviously, without any analysis a controlled demolition. I won’t push this too much, because it is so obvious.
            </p>
            <p>
                WTC is different, because here, you see, the collapse began at the point of impact, and the only resistance to collapse was inertia of the floors as they accumulate on the falling mass. How do we explain this kind of
                collapse?
            </p>
            <p>
                NIST is not as stupid as you, and understands that the collapse had zero resistance. The way NIST explained it is that the core was weakened by fire, and when the building collapsed, it “pancaked”, meaning that each floor
                immediately on impact severed all its columns and struts, and joined the falling mass above it, with zero stress transmitted at impact.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is absurd, because it simply is impossible for any impact on steel structures to do this. At best a part can buckle, then another part, and the building slowly plastically deform and have parts fall over. Steel is
                simply not glass. It doesn’t shatter on impact. Falling with zero stress means that the steel shattered on impact. But this is difficult to explain to a monkey.
            </p>
            <p>
                But it was obviously the only explanation that was compatible with the government story of hijacked planes, so all the engineers signed on to it like monkeys, and those that refused were threatened with political reprisal
                and kicked out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ok, so they were stupid. What’s the right explanation? The right explanation is that the steel structure was weakened in the hour before the collapse so that it WOULD shatter. The beams were eaten away partially, gradually,
                and in parts uniformly, so that a large fraction of all the steel was melted. Once the core connections were all uniformly fragile enough, the building actually would collapse the way it did, by collapsing from the point of
                impact down without any resistance other than inertia, because the core beams are now a swiss cheese of eaten metal with no ability to transmit stress, and no ability to withstand impact without breaking into a thousand
                smithereens.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not heated by fire. Melted by incendiaries. Cut, blasted, melted into a pool of molten steel that people saw. The steel dripping down the side of the building. The material continued to be hot for weeks underground, because
                the heat was supplied by tons and tons of material which was undergoing a chemical reaction.
            </p>
            <p>That’s what happened at WTC 1 and 2. At WTC 7, it wasn’t anything elaborate like this, it was just a plain old controlled demolition.</p>

                Criminality had nothing to do with German persecution of Jews, as there was no exceptional criminality statistics among Jews in Germany, and the Jews were assimilated. The real motivation is to remove monotheism and restore

                I read more about Yiddish. The main problem here is the Khazar hypothesis is still ridiculed, when recent genetics and good history make it clear that it is likely the correct origin of at least a large part if not the
                majority, of Ashkenazi Jews. Once the Khazar hypothesis is accepted, the story of French migration becomes patently ridiculous, and the origin of German Jews is clearly from the East. This favors the Eastern theories of
                Yiddish origin, but not with certainty. The academic discourse is being polluted because the main point— Khazar origin— is suppressed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t know why it is suppressed, really. A lot of Ashkenazi Jews told me that Sephardi Jews were considered “more authentic” in the Ashkenazi community, with better ties to historical Biblical Judaism. The Khazar origin of
                Ashkenazi Jews should not be threatening to Jews at all. What’s wrong with being Khazar? People are people. Central Asia is a nice place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, once the Khazar thing is respectable among normal people, instead of just Neo-Nazis (a certain percentage of neo-Nazis support this hypothesis also), then you can determine the linguistic origins of Yiddish in an
                objective way which doesn’t involve infighting between bigoted academics. I don’t know enough to say which of these folks is right, but the historical guy, the one who said it comes from France, is definitely wrong, because
                Ashkenazis didn’t come from France, they came from the East for sure.

                I read more about this, I strongly dispute the content of that page. It isn’t compatible with readings of Hitler, and it is simply trying to protect Nietzschian philosophy from the stain of association with Hitler, and
                shoving Hitler on the cross instead. He is not an actual Christian, at least not in any historically accurate meaning of the term, and he is not a pure Nietzschian either. He is Hitler, he’s his own thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The “historical destiny” God can be a personal God too, it’s not necessarily impersonal, and I didn’t mean to imply that it was. Hitler did believe he was on the side of historical destiny God. It just wasn’t the normal
                Catholic God of his youth, at least not as interpreted normally. He was sure that Jesus was an Aryan, he drew a blonde Jesus as an artist. He believed that God was on the side of racial supremacy, and culling of those he
                percieved as weak, by means of state power. He supported homicidal eugenics, something the church has always consistently opposed with no exception (and opposed in Nazi Germany too, when they were gassing the mentally
                handicapped, which is why the holocaust was kept more or less a secret), and his positions reflect a populist German brand of Nietzschianism, because although he wasn’t a Nietzsche reader, the ideas of Nietzsche had
                thoroughly seeped in throughout Germany. The main idea of Nietzsche is that monotheism strangles the strong with the ethics of slaves, and that Jews imposed Christianity on others, so as to weaken the others. Nietzsche
                himself hated traditional Christian anti-Semitism, because he hated Christianity. Hitler just wasn’t clever enough to hate Christianity, or else he was just clever enough to hide his hatred of Christianity. He just
                publically hated the Jews, something which both Nietzchians and Christian anti-Semites could both agree on.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can read his words in Mein Kampf (I read it a long time ago, by skimming, it’s online). He is opposed to the doctrines of weakness— he opposes the notion that “the meek shall inherit the Earth”, he considers the notion
                of submission and passive resistance as abhorrent, he believes in ruthless power, and says so explicitly.
            </p>
            <p>Bormann was the true Nietzschian, it is true, not so much Hitler, who was not. But the rank-and-file SS was Nietzschian, not weird perverted Christian. The head honcho was more superficially Christian than the rest.</p>
            <p>
                The complicity of the Catholic church with Hitler is well known, and this stains Pope Pius forever. But in contrast, individual Catholics and pious Protestants formed the greatest core of resistance to Hitler throughout the
                regime.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fact is that Hitler was trying to reform Christianity as a religion of strength, with an Aryan jesus, a doctrine of merciless cruelty, and an ethics of absolute subservience to state authority. These are simply not
                compatible with Christianity in any form, although because the Church didn’t like Jews for religious reasons, it did not object to the murder of Jews unless they had become Catholic.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Jews that converted to Catholicism were butchered just the same as all the rest. Conversion didn’t help, because Nietzsche style anti-semitism is not against the Jews because they are Jewish, it is against the Jews
                because it imagines that they are the ones who produced monotheistic Christianity, and it is against monotheism. Hitler, like all good politicians, was all things to all people, and both Nietzschians and Christian
                anti-Semites could find something to support.
            </p>
            <p>The way to resolve such disputes is to read the actual sources, and see who had the power in the regime. Was it the Christian Catholic anti-Semites? Or was it the secular Nietzschians?</p>
            <p>Unlike Hitler, Mussolini is openly Nietzschian.</p>
            <p>Neitzche wasn’t the official philosopher of the Nazis for no reason, even though he wasn’t Hitler’s favorite. As I said, Naziism wasn’t a pure cult of personality, Hitler was just the top man.</p>

                Ok, mental pain is sometimes good, as the act of learning to read involved a ton of mental pain, and I’m sure you approve. It’s sometimes bad, as for example, going through shell-shock. The stuff we are talking about is

                In rude forums, people come in with NO TRAINING AND NO EXPERTISE and occasionally have good ideas. There was a fellow at stackexchange who asked a nice question with an idea (I forgot what it was) which was totally original,
                totally correct, and completely wonderful.

                I have been arguing against a nearly unanimous position in this whole comment threat, nearly alone (the other people who agreed with me were all only, well, trolling!). Is it really hard to see the points everyone made and
                cut through the insults? Not at all because there are an equal number of insults, 100 people each giving 1 insult to me, and me giving 100 insults back, one to each of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                So in terms of insult/comment, I am the worst offender, but in terms of total number, it’s equal. Trolling neutralizes the authority, and then you can make up your own mind without the bias of feeling like you’re in the
                minority.
            </p>
            <p>It’s a psychological trick— it’s 1 person’s insults vs. 100 people’s insults, you’re still in the minority really, but the psychological effect is real, the two positions are battling in a position on equality.</p>
            <p>
                Then people go home and think about it, and the right position wins. I’ll give you a clue, the right position is my position, and the evidence that it is right is the very discussion which establishes it, i.e. this comment
                thread.

                I agree with you regarding harassment. My point is that this harassment, while over the line, is being used as a pretext to institute policy which has the effect of stifling rudeness, and stifling rudeness is something which
                simply cannot be tolerated, as rudeness is simply the only way to have a legitimate debate in a field which is politically closed to debate (and it helps with open fields too).
            </p>
            <p>
                Rudeness does alienate the “superior”, you will hardly ever persuade anyone by being rude, and you always, always, have a far better chance with a polite correction. But, counterintuitively enough, despite this being true, a
                polite correction online is nevertheless ALWAYS a mistake!
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason is that in an internet discussion, your goal is not to persuade the “superior”. On the internet, you don’t have a superior, you only have the debate. Nobody is superior except to the extent that they have a point
                to make, and can write it down effectively. So sure, you will alienate the superior nine times out of ten with the rudeness, but you have a much better chance of persuading the disinterested passerby that your case has
                merit, and then they are persuaded to do their own research, and then the truth emerges, one reader at a time. If you are wrong and rude, you will get corrected. If you are right and rude, the readers will persuade
                themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s the point of internet rude discussion. It hardly ever ends amicably between the participants, but the rudeness levels the authority playing field, it makes the contrasts stark and sharp, and bad or weak arguments are
                exposed quickly.
            </p>
            <p>In the absence of rudeness, the following will fly as an argument (real example):</p>
            <p>
                “You claim that nonabelian gauge theory configurations randomize at long distances on the lattice, but this is hopelessly out of date. This is belied by the simulations of
                <a title="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3423" href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F1303.3423%3AwRZu_cmzp748Pw_nw2JbD0PKxsI&amp;cuid=187837" rel="nofollow noopener">http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3423</a> ,
                which show that the configurations in Landau gauge are consistent with a beta which has a sign change at low momentum” (ACTUAL COMMENT! To me, in accurate paraphrase)
            </p>
            <p>This is COMPLETE BALDERDASH, it’s not true that this is claimed in the paper, it is not true of the interpretation, but it is true of the stunningly stupid MISinterpretation of this bozo. How to respond? One can say.</p>
            <p>“I believe that you are misinterpreting this paper, the authors do not come to the conclusion you state…”</p>
            <p>But this response is FAR TOO WEAK! This gives an air of respectability an academic debate to a position which is out and out FRAUD. So you respond like this:</p>
            <p>
                “You are OUT OF YOUR MIND! There is NO CHANCE IN HELL that the lattice gauge theory doesn’t randomize on a large lattice, as I SIMULATED IT MYSELF, thousands of people simulated it themselves, and EVERYBODY HAS SEEN IT
                RANDOMIZE WITH THEIR OWN EYES since 1974!”
            </p>
            <p>What this does is eliminate any idea that a compromise position is possible, and it creates two stark choices, and only one may be supported, not both. When this happens, the reader is forced to choose.</p>
            <p>
                Such a reader will be put off by the harsh language, but in the end, after reviewing the papers, if they know anything technical, they will side with the critique, simply because it is factually correct. This is in fact what
                happened in this case, although I got called out for “trolling behavior” when I posted responses of this nature.
            </p>

                This is simply the only credible way to maintain accuracy in a discussion which is open to the whole world. You can’t be polite to every idea, because when an idea is totally wrong, you need to harshly say so, and let the
                readers do their own peer review, until that idea dies a painful (quick) death. That’s it. There’s no alternative.
            </p>
            <p>
                You might say “what about using academic authority? Perhaps you could say— if what you were saying were true, it would be authoritatively accepted.” The problem with this is that the mentally retarded opinion he stated WAS
                AUTHORITATIVELY ACCEPTED in a journal, in a peer-reviewed publication, with some respectable number of citations. The academic authority system is not perfect, heck, it’s not even very good, and there are lots and lots of
                things that are totally wrong that would slide by in the old pre-internet days for years, decades, or centuries, with absolutely no correction, just based on their authority.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other alternative is polite debate which never ends and leaves everyone confused. I would also lose that debate, because my correction came with zero citations and zero academic credibility (as it usually does). But the
                lack of credibility or paper, or citations, does not change the property of long-distance gauge theory, I am still objectively right about this, and if I am right and if I am rude, I have nothing to fear, because then I will
                win.
            </p>
            <p>When I am wrong and I am rude, I will be rudely corrected, and then I learn something. Either way, everyone is better off when there is rudeness.</p>
            <p>
                The non-rude method doesn’t persuade the side that is wrong, because the side that is wrong is also surely the side which is intellectually dishonest and extremely stupid, or else they wouldn’t have made the mistake to begin
                with.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further, aside from experts, there are people who will NEVER CHECK the calculations, and will just trust the most respected author if there is no harsh critique (they will just be apprehensive of both sides when there is a
                critique, until consensus forms for which side is right). For their benefit, it is important to be 100% clear in your comment that you disagree vehemently, that you think that the thing is total crap, so that after people do
                the calculations or whatever and realize that you were right, they will know that the other side was COMPLETELY WRONG, nothing to salvage, no merit whatsoever.

                This is a brutal form of intellectual discussion, and it is simply hard to tolerate in any community. It leads to quick progress in finding truth, and it is simply the default discussion behind the scenes in a physics
                department, or at least was throughout the 20th century. This is why physics was able to run circles around other fields in terms of progress, where we went from Maxwell’s equations in 1900 to knowing AdS/CFT in 1997. There
                is no comparable advance in the knowledge of humanity in any other field, there was more progress in those 97 years than in all of the previous history of humanity combined (and in my opinion, the great bulk of that progress
                post-dates 1960). and the rudeness was the central component which enabled it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am sorry, but the moment people talk about “trolling” and “restricting online behavior”, the first people to go under the cross-hairs are those who say things like what I said above. This is not a hypothetical, I have been
                kicked out of physics forums, off of Wikipedia, and off of Quora (for nonphysics things), because of the no-compromise rude and hostile responses. I will not back down on this, it is simply not acceptable to be polite, and
                any attack on trolling is an attack on impolite speech in disguise, and therefore a direct attack on academic honesty and academic progress on the internet full stop.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only reason that an appreciation for rudeness is not more common in all academic fields is because of the layers of authority preventing people from entering the literature. This means that the mechanism of entry is not
                through actual challenge of the intellectual position, but first through an apprenticeship, and then through a worthless posturing, a comparison of credentials. In an open discussion, there is no such thing, so there is
                nothing to stop people from posting nonsense. But there is also nothing stopping people from REBUTTING nonsense forcefully, and when nonsense is rebutted without hesitation as forcefully as possible, the discussion is better
                than any academic journal, by miles and miles, because not only the wrong ideas of those out of power are exposed, also the WRONG IDEAS OF EXPERTS are exposed and jetissoned.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no other reason for the internet’s existence in my opinion, other than bringing the gift of rudeness out of physics departments and spreading it to the masses. It is doing just that and people are trying to stop it,
                through linking this to far-fetched claims of violence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Threats and harrassment are already crimes, and there is no need to legislate new crimes for rude internet speech. Current law covers actual threats very well. The problem is that there is an attempt to make a consensus that
                politeness be the unofficial policy for internet discussion in both private and public hands, and politeness is simply a disease which cannot be tolerated.

                Ok, there’s a problem with this analysis, in that you don’t appreciate that the internet, with it’s rudeness, allows true scientific hypotheses to get a fair hearing, but only if those defending them are not shut up by
                censors. The censorship rules misidentify all criticism of authoritative comments as a form of “trolling”, or “unacceptable behavior”, because it always consists of a relative nobody telling a whole bunch of accepted experts
                “you don’t know what you are taking about”.
            </p>
            <p>
                This activity, when it is unrestricted by notions of politeness or civility, can produce a culture in which false beliefs are quickly eradicated. This is the culture of physics in the 20th century. Harrassment in real life
                is different from the debates of the internet, and the protections against harrassment, which are necessary, must take care to never make it acceptable to silence dissenting voices.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main problem in the internet today is not the harrassment, it is the encroaching censorship and civility. Without it, many ideas which today struggle woud be easily able to make breaktrhoughs, as only in a civil context
                is it appropriate to insult, say, an abiogenic petroleum expert, or a committed Marlovian scholar, as an ignorant yahoo without this person being able to write that the critic is the real yahoo.
            </p>
            <p>
                The freedom to criticize from those who lack authority to those that have authority always seems rude, an it must be protected at all costs online, as this is the only thing that makes the internet different from previous
                media.

                I am truly amazed by your ability to evaluate this! Your lucidity is inspiring! I guess I was just misled into thinking you were an illiterate when you didn’t even know the basic scaling law for amount of water flowing down

                That wasn’t a trick question, dude. It’s simple everyday physics, and you don’t even need Wikipedia, you can use dimensional analysis to figure it out, if you know basic engineering. You can also use your gut sense, or your
                intuition, if you have practical engineering experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your gut sense is that water flows four times as quickly out of a straw twice as wide. That collosal underestimate means you need to face it, you’re an ignorant shithead whose underqualified for reading and comprehending,

                Hitler possibly believed in a sort of God, the same sort of historical-destiny God Nietzsche mentions sometimes, but this is certainly not the monotheistic God derived from the Christian tradition, which as far as I heard,
                Hitler considered incompatible with modern scientific understanding (it’s somewhere on Wikipedia, that’s the extent of my knowledge).
            </p>
            <p>
                He does not ever persuasively assert Christian beliefs as far as I can see, although as a politician he is required to do this, as you say. He certainly he doesn’t hold Catholic beliefs as an adult, as one of the principal
                tenets is the complete equality and unity of all races, at least anyone among them who accepts Catholicism. Hitler’s policy were ruthless toward the Catholic Slavs and toward the Orthodox Slavs (let alone the Marxist Slavs).
                His biggest financial support base was international Protestant capital, not Catholics, although his political base at home was in large part Catholic.
            </p>
            <p>
                He met with clergy, he struck deals with churches, but his movement’s eventual long-term goal was either the eradication of Christianity, or at least, it’s complete de-Judaization, and a Nietzschian-style restoration of
                pre-monotheistic ethics. I don’t consider Naziism a pure cult of personality either, so Hitler the person is not so important, as his ideas only get power through reinforcement from others around him. Among his political
                supporters and enablers, the great majority were rabidly anti-Marxist top industrialists and financiers, who were anti-Christian, or at least anti-Catholic, in large numbers. These people included a large number of Nietzsche
                followers, as they do to this day. So even if Hitler himself was a Christian, then he would have been a misled puppet figurehead for the Nietzschians behind him, a proposition which is extremely dubious.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hold to those beliefs described in the section of your link entitled “Hitler myths”. Hitler was not a sincere Christian, his regime was the closest the world came to reversing the Christian revolution of the 5th century
                AD, and Marxism too, I suppose. His Reich church would replace monotheistic ethics with a subserviance to a political order of the party, with all ethics contingent on the poitical decisions at the top. This is much as
                Communism in Russia had replaced the Orthodox church with subservience to the communist party.

                I don’t have any authority, and I don’t want it and I don’t need it. Authority is useless online, people make up their own minds regardless of your authority, by simply reading the debate and deciding. Authority is only
                useful in media where some people are shut out by decree, and the authority is let in through a social process. When everyone can participate, authority is actually a hindrance, because you can’t say certain things, at least
                not if you want to maintain your position of authority.

            <p>
                The internet ethics are not exactly decided democratically, not if democracy means voting without information. These ethical questions are decided like all other ethical questions, by open debate and long discussions without
                censorship. I have no more authority than anyone else, I have LESS AUTHORITY, in fact NONE AT ALL, because I am posting insults to others.

            <p>
                Nobody takes anyone seriously with ad-hominem attacks, but they always come anyway, in support of whatever happens to be the powerful position. The insults are just designed to be over-the-top, to even out the insult
                environment and make all the cumulative effect of all the previous insults go away. This happens very fast, the insults become irrelevant once there are enough of them. At this point, people focus on the content, and only
                look at objective evidence. Without the stage being evenly muddy with roughly equal amounts of mutual insult, the arena for objective review is simply unavailable.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is unforunately required to have an even balance of insults on the page before people look at the facts objectively. When there is only one side posting insults, people believe that the insulting side must be strong, and
                don’t bother looking at the objective evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                So the first rule of propaganda is to insult the opposition, until all sides are covered with mud. When you are finished with the insults, then you present the objective evidence. The side with the objective evidence has
                nothing to worry about in a muddy environment.

                That’s not what’s going on here. What you get from him is “I AM racist, because I have this black judge denying my motions, and overruling my objections.” It’s weird, because despite the superficial flagrant assertion of
                racism, the actual content is not demeaning to anyone. It’s weird, there’s none of the usual racist attempt to diminish others using an implicitly accepted racial heirarchy to force them into a servile powerless position.

                uninitialized pointer’ and he was totally pissing me off.” The power imbalance is pointing the wrong way for racism. It’s hard to do, because racism is really pervasive, and hard to avoid or mock, even if you are black. I

                The trolls, when they are sincere, are using methods of ridicule to reduce the authority of nincompoops who don’t deserve it, because these nincompoops are both wrong and saying nothing original. The modern-day version of
                trolls attack positions with over-the-top ridicule, because this is the only way to strip it of authority. This is the constructive thing people call “trolling” today, and this thing is absolutely essential for internet
                discourse to function. Without it, you get a mass of gullible know-nothings flooding every discussion with repetition of the well-trod known-to-everyone nothing-new-here majority view, in ten thousand slightly different
                phrasing.

            <p>The troll gets them to shut up until they have something new and informative to say. Or, if they don’t, the troll makes them look ridiculous until they do. That’s the purpose of trolling, it is its function.</p>
            <p>
                Now there is something else called “trolling” which is just a sort of verbal prank, involving insincerely posting offensive material. This behavior is what “trolling” originally meant, but the term has drifted now, and I’m
                not going to accept conflating activity A with activity B.

                Sort of, not exactly, it depends on the details. That’s what they say, that they are in danger, but they don’t make themselves seem powerless. Their caricatures of Jews are of a powerless sexless nebbish with a grating
                accent who sometimes get into a position of power through occult practices, and their caricatures of blacks are of borderline homeless hoodlums with no appeal. This is to deny actual power to those folks, which is something
                that, for them, involves masculine sexual authority and threat of violence.

            <p>
                You are making it out to be a natural thing, like it was just one crazy guy taking a little bit of German folklore and exploiting a history of anti-semitism like there was in France or Spain. That’s not what it was as I see
                it, this was not an opportunistic thing, it was the main goal of the program. Reaing Nietzsche is essential here.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think you fail to appreciate the uniqueness of the new kind of post-industrial secular anti-Christian Nietzschian anti-semitism. It’s something complete different from Christian anti-Semitism. Nietzsche SHUNS all previous
                anti-semitism, he thinks it is boorish and primitive and completely wrong, because it is an outgrowth of Christian thinking, which he despises.
            </p>
            <p>
                He substitutes for this something else, which is hatred of monotheistic ethics. Without monotheistic ethics, people, Nietzsche realized, would go right back to the order of Rome, with slavery, naked power, sexual
                exploitation, sadism, and general barbarism and a pure Darwinian political society, and he liked this idea, so he advocated it. He didn’t mind Jews who liked this idea too, by the way, he was happy with atheistic German Jews
                who advocated the same thing he was advocating. He just didn’t like what he considered to be the Jewish monotheistic ethics, even though these ethics are really Christian inventions if you look at them closely..
            </p>
            <p>
                The old pre-Nietzsche Christian anti-Semitism is the old tale of the blood-libel, it goes like this: Jews rejected and crucified Christ, then they rejected the redemption, and this rejection leaves them permanently vengeful
                and hateful, applying barbaric pre-Christian ideas of eye-for-eye and blood for blood, instead of the more modern (in the sense of the 2nd century AD) ideas of charity and forgiveness, and spiritual growth through meditation
                and so on. Think of Barrabas or Shylock from Marlowe’s plays. It is false, because the Jews had the same revolution in the religion as Christians did in 135 AD with the modern diaspora and the Jewish martyrs. In the end, the
                Jews converged on something which is essentially indistinguishable, metaphysics aside, from the Christians.
            </p>
            <p>
                The antagonism of Christianity and Judaism in the centuries preceding Nietzsche was simple religious conflict, like Jews vs. Samaritans in ancient times. The Christians put pressure on Jews to convert, they evicted them from
                place to place, but there was no concept of eradication or genocide, or any type of racial discrimination here, simply because this concept wouldn’t occur to a pre-Nietzsche anti-semite.
            </p>
            <p>
                The anti-semitism of Luther is of the old sort, the anti-semitism in Europe in general was of this old sort before the late 19th century. I believe Hitler was piggy-backing off of this anti-semitism to extend his appeal, but
                his anti-semitism is nothing like that. Hitler’s anti-semitism is Nietzche’s.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a direct attack on monotheism, it is really attacking Christianity not Judaism, by persecuting the Catholics, and deforming the Protestant churches to his will. The Bible was replaced with the Grimm tales in the
                schools in the period in question, on purpose to remove Jewish influence. Jewish works were burned, and Jewish contributions to thinking were denied, including religious thinking. Even Christmas was denuded of
                representations of Christ (this was controversial, but it happene in the later years of the era).
            </p>
            <p>
                Wherever possible, ethical questions that usually involve looking to God for guidance were removed using the Fuehrerprinzip, that you look only to Hitler to determine right or wrong. The Fuhrerprinzip was really an
                abdication of monotheistic ethics, and it was used to produce behaviors which could not be done since the modern religious era began in the 5th century.
            </p>
            <p>
                Borrowing from an equally secular and even more Rome-worshipping Mussolini, the Nazis made a restoration of Roman pomp and ceremony, and they restored one by one nearly all the things that the midieval era had gradually
                abolished. So you saw slavery state torture, and absolute power unchecked by any church.
            </p>
            <p>
                To this, they added totatlitarian surveillance, and the class rule of a Protestant bourgeoisie with unlimited power, and a complete disenfranchisment of Catholics whose religion was considered second only to Judaism in
                perniciousness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wagner was a traditional anti-semite, not a Nietzschian anti-semite, and Nietzsche did not like him because of this. But traditional anti-semitism was not antagonistic to the new kind of anti-semitism, Hitler, to the extent
                that he paid lip-service to Christianity, was both, But reliance on Christianity just blocked the attempts to extend this to a removal of Christianity from Germany. But the removal of Christianity was going on still. The
                goal was to produce a purely German national identity, free of sentimental ethics (ethics) and Jewish ethics (monotheism).
            </p>
            <p>
                The eventual goal was to wipe out Christianity as is clear from policy, from associations, and from Hitler’s writings. Nazi anti-semitism was first and foremost of the Nietzschian variety, and not any kind of traditional
                Christian catholic or Lutheran variety. It wanted to wipe out religion by wiping out what they saw as its source, then by gradually removing its manifestations.
            </p>
            <p>
                This type of anti-semitism produces genoicide, because the idea is that the Jews carry monotheism in their genes, and you can’t have them poisoning future generations. It also has no compunctions about genocide, because it
                has no sentimental ethics, your goal is to become hard as a rock, and to be able to murder without sentiment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mass conversion of Jews saved lives in previous Christian-Jewish conflicts, but it was useless here. The Nazis were simply murdering to erase people who they felt enslaved them with the monstrous lie of God, and they
                identified these people as the Jews.
            </p>
            <p>Hitler was not at all a religious fellow. If he had any faith, it was gone when he left the trenches.</p>

                . Unlike other people here, I don’t make crap up for rhetorical purposes. Now you can conclude from this that he is lying somewhere. Here is an informative pre-prison interview:
                <a title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37oBowW7vyQ" href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D37oBowW7vyQ%3AEQMBkpqNKJveMXy68bIcHpgqx3c&amp;cuid=187837" rel="nofollow noopener">

                . However, earlier videos I have seen show a person who is somewhat deranged in a Bobby Fischer way, railing about Jewish this and Jewish that. It’s difficult to know what is sincere, because the attitudes change from
                instance to instance, this is unforunately a symptom of drug abuse and lack of a solid center.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think it is next to impossible to be aware of power structures in society to the extent that he is and simultaneously be a racist, it’s like knowing calculus and simultaneously failing to realize that a product of two odd
                numbers is always odd. It’s logically possible, sure, but it’s difficult to imagine. Racism of any kind is really, really, primitive.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not 100% sure on his position, one of the problems with drugs is that drug addled people don’t have a consistent position from moment to moment, it all depends on the details of the momentary brain chemistry. but the
                sophisticated awareness of power and trolling makes it unlikely. By the way, being one quarter Jewish, or even half Jewish (like Fischer), or full Jewish (like Fischer, really) does not immunize you to the anti-Jewish thing
                in any way. But I believe awareness of power structures must, because that’s what its all about.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that I’ve heard his voice, it isn’t what I imagined it to be. His trolling is valid, it’s good trolling and it’s for the right reasons in my opinion, but there’s something unstable there, unfortunately more like Valerie
                Solenas than Richard Stallman. There is absolutely no need to repeat an experiment in psychotropic drugs which failed entirely, and decimated the radical movements once, and can do so again.

                What else is there to salvage? Race-baiting? Anti-semitism? Church-burning? Lynching? Jim Crow? Goose-stepping? Science-denial? Genetic supremacy? Class superiority? Roman ethics? Slavery? Genocide? Amphetamines? Death
                metal? There’s nothing here which isn’t completely repulsive except Thor, Grimm, fondue and yodeling. When I was young, I couldn’t understand how ANYONE could possibly get into this Nazi stuff, even with all its implied
                priviledge, for any reason other than being born evil. But of course nobody is evil in the genes, 1968 Germany was not caused by gamma rays from space. But 1930s Germany wasn’t all about fondue and yodeling either.
            </p>
            <p>
                I suspect (without evidence) it’s this way: People always look for an identity. They reject the Christian identity, for one reason or another, probably because they like to have sex. So they find the pre-Christian Western
                European thing, where you could have sex whenever you felt like it.
            </p>
            <p>
                So now you have a bunch of repressed people who hate the Jews because they think all that repression is the Jews’ fault. That is, if those Jews didn’t exist, there wouldn’t be any Christianity, everyone would be pagan, and
                they would be having sex-orgies.
            </p>
            <p>
                They don’t blame the actual European Christians that spread the Christian religion, because if it was really non-Jews spreaing this out of necessity, you know, like the historical record describes, then that means that
                monotheism would be an inevitable process, the inevitable outcome of human social evolution. Since it can’t be, because it makes people so miserably repressed, it has to be some imposition by other people. So they think it’s
                the Jews’ fault, because, you know, look at the Bible. If that was your only source for the history of religion, what would you think?
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s easy, because the scriptures make Christianity look more Jewish than it really is, and make the God concept look like it’s owned by Jews in some special way which of course it’s not. So the Jew hatred is really special,
                there’s nothing the Jews can do to fix it, because it’s really God hatred, accidentally redirected due to the content of the only holy book they have.
            </p>
            <p>
                So the Nazis really think there’s a defective monotheistic gene hidden inside the Jewish chromosomes that tells Jews to lie to people about the monotheistic business, and then Jews use their “unique genius of persuasion” (in
                Neitzsche’s term) to make the whole world monotheistic. They think this monotheistic gene just needs to be eradicated, and for things to go back to pagan times, with orgies and slaves and gladiator games, and all that
                wonderful stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                They hate on other races for a much more banal reason, simply because these pagan traditions don’t consider humanity as one unit, bound under one universal ethical notion, but rather each little clan has its own gods, and
                those gods take care only of their own members. They enslave and use other clans for whatever purpose, as they are not under the protection of their specific tribal deity. This means that they look for any opportunity to
                demean and exploit others, and then you get all the rest of the horror. They like you less and less the less you look like a European, because, you know, that means your god looks less and less like thier god. It’s really
                that shallow.
            </p>
            <p>
                They also imagine this paganism is secretly what Jews believe in private, and that the Jewish religion is publically monotheistic, but secretly pagan, and Jews are doing terrible things to others in secret rituals. This is
                what historical anti-semitism says about Jews, for completely different reasons. So now they hate the Jews even more, and everyone else can go to hell too, and that’s Naziism.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t see any other coherent motivation for the peculiar convergence of unique crazy ideas that come together in Nazi ideology, other than restoring the pre-Christian Europe, and ridding it of the “Jewish influence” of
                Christianity. It was a great puzzle to me where these ideas come from, these things weren’t invented by Hitler— he wasn’t very imaginative. I think it’s a Nietzchian attempt to get Christianity out of Europe, and then kill
                the Jews so that they don’t whip up another Jesus or something (as if you specifically needed Jews to do that). But Nietzsche wasn’t very imaginative either
            </p>
            <p>
                Since Marxism is a sort of Christianity 2.0, with modern capitalism replacing the Roman system, and since 2.0 was trying to replace 1.0, 1.0 was really weak in the 1930, and so the Nazis saw a chace to flush the whole thing
                down the toilet and go back to version 0.0. But of course, anyone who was going by 1.0 or 2.0 (or who had any decency) joined together and eradicated this crap.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then you can blame two things: the suppression of sex, and the suppression of Odin and Thor. The first is more or less quickly solved in a few decades postwar, anyone can do pretty much whatever without too much
                interference. But the second is still there, motivating a little bit of residual neo-nazism. I think that once Odin and Thor are respected a little bit, you won’t have any more of this cancer.
            </p>
            <p>Also, weev focuses only on this aspect, the Odin and Thor, which, being the most innocuous aspect of this whole set of beliefs, makes me think he isn’t sincere in this business.</p>

                It is likely that the level of threat is greater because of the gender issues, and it is possible that I am blind to it because I am a dude, and because I only care about freedom of speech.

                Yes, he did go “real world”, but in a way that is so remote from these other matters in risk and threat that to conflate them is more error than truth. He goes just past the edge, but no further. He doesn’t need to go past
                the edge at all, but everyone walking on the edge makes a misstep or two.

            <p>The troll wasn’t dangerous, you are just being made to think so.</p>
            <p>
                Online, when there is a majority opinion, trolling breaks through the miasma of authority to shine a clear light on the evidence and allow it to speak for itself. Without the trolling, authority clouds the discussion, and
                nothing can progress, no matter what the objective facts may be.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can explain something, but a horde of locusts come in and tell you that you are wrong, with authoritative citations. You need to be able to say “shut up, all of you. You’re retarded.” And not get kicked out, then present
                the evidence, and then let the people evaluate it neutrally, now that authority is neutralized.
            </p>
            <p>That’s what trolls are for, to neutralize authority.</p>
            <hr />
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>Trolling is a sacrament on the internet, as it is the mechanism by which you remove authority from discussions, and it is how you DIFFUSE LYNCH MOBS, like the nice little circle jerk of consensus you have here.</p>
            <p>
                Trolls break consensus, by inserting contrary opinion. They buck the group, they subvert authority. This is required for the internet to function as a medium which has something to say which is different from what has been
                said before, or is repeated ad-nauseum everywhere else.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without trolling, the internet turns into a chattier less eloquent version of “The Morning Circle of Joe and Friends” old media nonsense. You get people repeating the same bullcrap they hear on old media, and you get nothing
                subversive, nothing new, and nothing interesting. The internet trolls convert consensus to discord, and in the discord new ideas flourish and old ideas just become embarassing to hold.
            </p>
            <p>
                You don’t have to worry about protecting the status quo, if it is justified, it will reform itself unharmed after any challenge. The thing you need to worry about is a mob of folks silencing alternative viewpoints with
                one-way heckling which cannot be answered or rebutted. Because only insults in one direction are deemed “trolling”, insults in the other direction are deemed “getting rid of the troll”. The easy direction for insults is the
                direction of greater to lesser authority. The trolling is the insult going in the opposite direction. You need both directions to function in order for the authority to be neutralized, and the discussion to be at an
                appropriately high level. Both directions, or neither, but the direct and veiled insults from powerful to powerless are so natural, that to remove them is utopian fantasy.
            </p>
            <p>It is so essential for the functioning of honest peer-reviewing community online, that trolling online is one of the pillars of human existence, like charity, kindness, and goodwill to all.</p>

                It is the first time such a thing has been done, that’s true. I wouldn’t have thought it is possible to get away with, yes. But, shocked as I am, that swastika is sitting reasonably ok with me, it is so borderline, I keep
                dizzily going back and forth, back and forth, it still makes me queasy every once in a while. The thing is, it is really not being used to rail against the powerless at any point. Racism is about power, and weev always
                points the gun in the right direction. I genuinely think he might have been able to do it while staying in the kingdom of troll, without tripping over into the kingdom of hell. But he might not. I really don’t know for sure.
                That’s part of what makes him such an effective troll. I can’t tell, honest, I still can’t tell. But then I reserve judgement. But the very fact that one can’t tell, even with a swastika, and a long racial rant on a racist
                publication accepted without reservation, this speaks volumes— that doesn’t happen in the normal world, this is a special kind of black magic.

                The “documentation” you claim for a rape-threat is statements coming from the New York Times, which sounds pretty authoritative for a second, until you realize that the New York Times has been approximately as reliable as my

                What he claimed to have done, according to the article, is release information about the woman which included her home address, together with hateful material which made her feel threatened personally. This was not
                appropriate at all, it’s wrong, but it is in no way tantamount to a credible threat of rape, no matter how it was spun by the media.
            </p>
            <p>
                She got scared, it was wrong, I think this is not acceptable in any way, but that’s not the same level of threat as a stalker, or a real personal harrassment death-threat or rape-threat online. Those are simply much more
                serious.

                There is no Sierra case, she is a gasbag doing propaganda. Weev did not do what you are pointing to. This is a direct twitter criminal death threat, it is much more disturbing, as it is an actual death threat (unlike the

            <p>
                What I did know is that the folks commenting here are supporting a (wrong) majority view, which is that politeness is good. Weev is supporting a (correct) minority view that politeness is bad. I expect a reasoned debate over
                this, with actual ideas exchanged.
            </p>
            <p>
                But online, when there is a majority view, there is a numbers imbalance, and people like to chip in with their nonsense supporting the majority view. So you will get a whole avalanche of comments supporting it from people
                who don’t have any independent opinion, who don’t have any actual argument, and who wouldn’t know what an actual argument looks like even if it bit them on the leg.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way to deal with this is to attack them personally, until they start to come back with more substantial material which actually does have some meat in it. The “abuse”, “malice”, “lynch mob mentality” etc of my comments
                were designed to get these people to accept what they are, which is a collective mob with no independent thinking. Now you are coming back with me making a factual mistake, and a real inconsistency. GOOD. Trolling
                successful, you are now making an effective grown up argument, rather than an emotional laden feel-good reinforcement of majority opinion.
            </p>
            <p>You are also totally right, and it’s the first time I’ve voted up your comments. These discussions in reality, as you say, pose no threat to weev in Lebanon or wherever he is. I was wrong on that point.</p>
            <p>
                But, really, I got it wrong because I didn’t know anything about this two days ago, and I thought he was in jail somewhere, or getting prosecuted, due to insufficient familiarity with the story. But IGNORANCE DOES NOT STOP
                ME, as I am A TROLL doing COUNTERPROPAGANDA. It’s the other side’s job to find out when I made a mistake, good job.
            </p>

                You haven’t noticed something, but I’ll give you a clue— his last name is Auernheimer. Also, his tattoo is a bit unusual for a swastika, much more elaborate, his racist rants are unusual, in that the language is strangely
                restrained always skirting the border of the point of no return, and the abuse is directed only at powerful people, namely the judge and prosecution in his case. The only praise he gives to white supremacists is oblique
                praise of their preservation of Western European folklore, which is really the only nice thing you can say about them.

            <p>As far as I can see, weev has pulled off the troll equivalent of climbing Mt. Everest. It’s simply unbelievable, I would never have been able to pull of anything like this, it’s the next generation of troll.</p>

                That social circle is not a social circle, it’s a 10 creepy lonely guys in a basement, and he really isn’t all that popular among them— they are using him for publicity, he is simply writing to call attention to something

                Yes, the threats of violence are completely counterproductive, but this is simply not what was going on. The threat of violence is being invented by the author to give a pretext argue against heated language in general,
                saying that the “feeling of violence” which is the response to impolite language and forceful disagreement. That always feels like violence, and this is what the battle against internet trolling is trying to silence.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was a threat of violence implied by doxxing, and this is why doxxing is not useful or productive. But it isn’t really a real world threat of violence either, it is just something that hackers think will help when they
                are young and stupid. They know that an internet unsavvy person will be scared to death by this stuff, without any real signifcant danger.

                You are completely wrong, you have clearly not actually spent “hours” arguing with racists, as you would have slowly seen that they don’t make such facile arguments in an unending stream. They intersperse it with reasoning,
                which is approximately self-consistent and self-reinforcing. Further, the more exposure you have to this, the better you get at spotting subtle versions of it in media. Yes, online it’s sometimes less subtle, but the same
                people will produce a continuum of racism going from overt to subtle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Seeing this stuff and talking to those people in depth is what makes you realize that the attitude is held by ordinary people, not space aliens. As they continue discussing, they move from overt threats to explain subtler
                points. For example, ask a racist what is their favorite portrayal of a black character in film? If they point you to “Gone With The Wind” you learned something about that film. Ask them what is their favorite tool for
                arguing white supremacy, and they will point at the IQ test. You learn something about what that test is all about. It’s informative to argue with racists, at least until they start repeating themselves, and them it gets
                boring. This happens very fast.

                Yes, I know she had a breakdown, probably drug induced, it’s was the destruction of a great voice. SCUM wasn’t the cause, this was many years later. It was probably drugs, alienation, and personal money problems between her
                and Warhol, and it’s a terrible story. I didn’t know she was a schitzophrenic, the story is more plausible now, I couldn’t figure out how such an enlightened writer became an attempted murderer.
            </p>
            <p>
                That drug induced conversion of alternative viewpoints into homicidal rage happened a lot in the 1960s, for example, the SDS to the Weathermen, which finally ended with that horrible Brinks holdup in 1980 which murdered a
                security guard. That’s the main problem of the 1960s— what mechanism do you have to allow the speech, while preventing the violence?
            </p>
            <p>
                The solution was found in 1969, but nobody noticed for a while. The internet is the solution to this problem. This is why trollings place is online, where such things have to surmount a nearly insurmountable barrier to ever
                spill over into violence.
            </p>
            <p>The internet allows the humanities revolutions and also the scientific revolutions of the 1960s to be widely understood and accepted without the violence and drug damage that destroyed it.</p>

                I am choosing these two, because I don’t know anything about this stuff, I am not Western European and honestly I find pre-Christian Western European culture hokey, I am not a big fan of Alistair Crowley. But hokey or not so
                hokey, it’s a distinct ethnic culture, and it gives insight into literature and culture, and its worth preserving. These two, Odin and Thor, are ones weev talked about. Loki sounds better, as you say.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think they are suppressed in the same sense that Irish culture was suppressed in the 18th century, before the famine. Through political pressure to abandon this and join the majority Christian culture. This is ultimately
                what Nietzsche and Hitler were basing their movement on. Of course Christianity is vastly more important, but the pagan heritage didn’t really have a voice, as it was always commingled with Hitler style race-hatred, at least
                in the early half of the twentieth century. It seems to be separating from this today.
            </p>
            <p>
                I do feel connected with these groups because they are persecuted and marginalized (justly, because American and European racism is a more serious problem than neglect of pagan culture), it’s certainly not because I agree
                with them. I read their material while doing quick online research to make sure the holocause actually did happen as stated. At some point I became skeptical of the story, because I grew up in Israel surrounded by victims,
                so I was never exposed to the opinion of the perpetrators, for obvious reasons. After a few hours of searching, I found good firsthand documents from Pressac and good firsthand perpetrator testimony, from next generation
                Germans, which made it clear that the mainstream narrative is actually correct. The Odin and Thor cults were weird things that explained to me where these groups get their legs from. They really need to separate this stuff
                from racial hatred and white supremacy, so that it can just exist without being evil, oppressive, racist, or satanic.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like powerless people with an opinion, because I know they didn’t get this opinion by following the mainstream, although this particular opinion, of course, I could live without. So I look to see “what could possibly be
                worth salvaging in their brain damage?” And the stuff I find interesting is their focus on Western European ethnicity. Loki is good too, I suppose.

                Surreal huh? Better get used to it, nitwit. There was certainly no issue with you calling box boy names in the past, even though he knows what he is talking about, and you are speaking out of your anus. The mouth calls the
                anus dirty, and anus doth protest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Box boy doesn’t need to show anything, it is easy to cut columns with incendiaries, there are patents on the relevant devices, and cutting beams of that size has been reproduced on youtube (you look it up). The chemical
                detection was done properly and accurately in the paper, but I’m guessing you can’t read the paper, because you don’t know how. I’ll help you: a says “ah”, b says “buh”, c says “kh” or “ss”, etc.

                Further, regardless of your mental incapacitation regarding thermite devices, the physics of the falling buildings is completely impossible without demolition. You would be capable of evaluating said physics, if you weren’t
                a high school dropout.
            </p>
            <p>You don’t recognize propaganda for what it is.</p>
            <p>
                I don’t know what happened at that compound in 2011, and I also try to keep my mouth shut about it, because it was a propaganda win for the side I support when I go to the polling place in November, but I didn’t see any
                photos, any films, or any evidence at all, beyond “we say so”.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, I did see photos when they shot Che Guevara. The story has been defective, and there are credible reports that Osama bin Laden was dead for a while, and no pictures of him holding a newspaper dated anytime
                past 2003 or so.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, sorry, no I don’t listen to anything coming out of the mainstream media unless it is accompanied by charts and graphs, and solid evidence, and I certainly don’t believe anything anyone official has to say, and I believe
                what YOU have to say even less, which means your opinion counts for less than zero.

                He’s trolling, he’s been trolling the whole discussion. It’s hopeless to explain why trolling is required to people who know nothing about trolling. The only thing you can do is just to keep on trolling, and hope they get
                it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why is it hard to explain trolling? Because people just don’t usually see the authority structures that trolls are subverting by direct rude opposition, as these authority structures are invisible until you either have a old
                bad idea or a good new idea, at either of which points you feel them harshly pushing back at you.
            </p>
            <p>
                If all you’ve had are bad old ideas, the pushing back seems like a great thing, it’s a lot of heckling and abuse that serves to put you back on track. It’s only when you have a good new ideas that you see that the heckling
                doesn’t care about right and wrong at all, rather only about authority, and it is equally used to silence new folks who are right as new folks who are wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                The internet can overcome this, by merely providing a space for people to explain themselves, and to counteract the authority of received wisdom. The problem is that you get a mass of ignorant people coming at you like a
                tidal wave, each of them trying to defend the established orthodoxy. So you need to get rid of their authority, by harsh language, by calling them names, so that they lose that mantle of authority they get from parrotting
                something you already heard before.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trolling is there to protect important good new ideas, unpopular ideas, from authority. That’s its only purpose. But how can you explain this here? It’s next to impossible. So I suppose all you can do is just provide
                trolling examples and hope it sinks in.

                Hi Guest dude. “Sheldon Cooper” is an (offensive) caricature of me and all other physicists. If I had to guess, I would guess the model for Sheldon was either Lubos Motl or the physicist character in Woody Allen’s movie with
                that bald Seinfeld creator. Unlike Sheldon, Allen’s character is not a caricature.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheldon Cooper is out and out mockery by the bourgeoise media of the honest no-nonsense physicist discourse, which is extremely rude and direct, by linking it to psychopathology. For the same essential reason, this article
                is trying to link trolling to psychopathology. “Trolling” is simply physics culture exported to the rest of the world, it’s what good physicists have been doing to each other since at least the 1920s, and it’s how the field
                stays honest and makes progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                They don’t have any mental disorders or autism. Although I know it’s hard to believe, physicists behave that way ON PURPOSE, to make sure that bullshit doesn’t take over their field. It’s also kind of Soviet, as in the
                Soviet Union, bourgeoise phoniness was not necessary (you needed other kinds of phoniness), and direct challenge of authority (not government authority, your boss’s authority) was common.
            </p>
            <p>
                Negative peer review is another form of trolling, except hidden away so that you never see it. I don’t like private peer review, I prefer public peer review, because private peer review leads to something like this getting
                rejected:

                (nonsense that cited the right people). The fix is public peer review, where these mistakes are automatically corrected. That’s what the internet is for.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason one needs firm protection for what people identify as abusive behavior is because there are cases where one is NOT wrong, and yet people persist in thinking that one is, because of a cloud of authority. A few well
                placed insults removes all authority, and then after the insults start to fly, both sides present their case, and the objective truth becomes obvious to everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without the insults, there is no particular reason for truth to win, only authority matters. With insults, it can’t help but win, because only accuracy matters. That’s the lesson physicists learned, and it’s why we ran
                circles around all the other academic fields and still do.

                The illegitemate reasons are for denying someone authority, and this is includes abrasive behavior. Without the authority removing heckling, you don’t get anywhere close to the truth, instead it’s all feel-good stories that
                reinforce the community’s recieved wisdom.

                been written in crap on toilet paper in an asylum.

            <p>
                The level of danger was essentially tiny,, and the connection to the practice of “trolling” is nonexistent. I am merely pointing this out to do counterpropaganda, but I don’t know why I waste my time on anyone who would fall
                for this drivel.

            <p>You bring up really important points.</p>
            <p>
                The censorship I am talking about it real, but it can only be seen when you have a new correct idea that sounds stupid! Unfortunately, it’s not like I’m an oracle and can give you countless examples of this, but I can tell
                you an easy one where you can review the evidence quickly and come to be certain that it is simultaneously certainly correct and completely dismissed— abiogenic petroleum origin. If you try to introduce this idea in
                geological circles, you are simply heckled into silence, but I assure you that it is correct, and you don’t have to take my word for it, it was dogma in the USSR past 1968, after a grueling nearly 20 year debate. The Soviets
                actually openly debated this (unfortunately in Russian), and came to the right conclusion, and the West just sticks with the dogma. You can review the chemistry evidence in a few days, there is also Gold’s book “The Deep Hot
                Biosphere” which explains this.
            </p>
            <p>
                This thesis simply can’t be debated in the literature. But online, of course, no one can stop you. So it should be easy to explain to people online, right? But the fact is that if you wish to debate this online, and you want
                to not be quickly made to look like an idiot, you have to forcefully attack the opposing viewpoint, because you will immediately be flooded with ignorant counter-information, most of which is misinformed misreadings of the
                literature. For instance, people will explain that kerogen is routinely broken into petroleum today. This is not true, as the thing that is broken into petroleum is shale-oil, which is only called “kerogen” by convention
                with the biogenic theory. In the abiogenic theory, this is not kerogen at all, but hydrogenated ultra-heavy petroleum, actual kerogen has nitrogen in it, which betrays its biological origin (and also oxygen, of course, which
                is absent in petroleum). Similarly, you will hear that the isotope ratios are consistent with biology (they aren’t, they are consistent with small pore migration), that there are biomarkers (these are bacterial residues from
                archaea), that there are fossils in coal (the fossils were there before the rock turned to coal), that the He has an explanation (it doesn’t, as the He concentrations can range to 1000 times the surrounding rocks), that the
                chemical path to petroleum is understood (a lie only said by ignorant people), and so on, a whole bunch of nonsense, but all of it is backed up with the pseudo authority of misunderstood references and opinions of big shots.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because this is a disputed topic where all the (Western) experts are demonstrably wrong, it is impossible for anyone with the correct scientific hypothesis to get heard using any standard accepted method of debate. The best
                way to get heard in this circumstance is to simultaneously rebut the arguments, and present the case disrespectfully, so that the authority of the experts is diminished with each rebuttal. Then once you rebut all the points,
                you are done, you win. The insults serve to remove the authority from the experts, so that the only authority that remains is that which is supported by factual evidence. This is unfortunately the only effective way to
                debate an ossified point where all authorities are wrong. It is codified as a rule of physics discourse.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the start of this process, you look like the most unconstructive of idiots, and a complete troll (you are). But this is what happens when you have an unpopular idea, you always look like an idiot, whether it is correct or
                incorrect. This is the “Galileo problem”, and it is fixed with trolling. Galileo also fixed it with a form of trolling, Simplicio is mocking the Aristotelians. At the end, you simply look like you were right, and your
                victory was inevitable. But it was not at all inevitable, you don’t get anywhere without trolling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, what “trolling” means in an internet context is a stream of personal insults directed at an individual which hurts their feelings. It is mockery which removes or denies authority to an individual. An example would be
                “You mental reject, of course the biomarkers in petroleum come from underground archaea”. This type of discourse is forbidden in professional journals, at least when the other side is powerful. It is tacitly accepted in
                chit-chat and in referee reports when the other side is powerless (“Yeah, you know, he’s one of them abiogenic yahoos”, “Those guys are crazy”, “They don’t have a leg to stand on”, etc). Online, trolling quickly levels the
                playing field, allowing the ideas to battle on equal footing. Then the correct idea quickly wins, and you’re back to normal.
            </p>
            <p>The article makes the subversive authority denying practice of trolling look like a form of personal harrassment, by focusing on actual harrassment, and ridiculously linking it “trolling”.</p>
            <p>
                People can moderate, sure, but it is best if this is minimal, and self-correcting. I am active on a site called “physicsoverflow”, and the way that physicsoverflow deals with it is “spam is deleted, irrelevant stuff is
                deleted, and anything with physics content is preserved, although if it is off the wall, it is moved to chat” This model might work in greater generality.

                I don’t know, she is just the same as anyone else, she can post her nonsense. She wasn’t killed by trolling, she was temporarily silenced by doxxing. This is why doxxing is wrong. It just isn’t the same kind of wrong as
                threatening murder or rape, it’s a second-degree kind of evil.

                It was only inciting in the mind of the internet unsavvy victim, not in the mind of anyone else, not in weev’s mind, nor in any of the folks who were “threatening” her. It was simply not a real incitement, just a
                psychological ploy.
            </p>
            <p>
                That doesn’t make it right, mind you, just not the same level as attempted rape or murder, or real-world incitement for those, or internet incitement of those with credible threat. It was just empty posturing which was truly
                scary.

        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                What that MEANS is that somebody kept sending her private messages, in a way that was real-world significant, not that she felt insulted by trolls in a forum. It’s real-world to a certain extent, if it is email, or instant
                messaging, or something ostensibly private.

        <div>
            <p>Yes I am, I was one of the early ones. Also, by trolling here, I am demonstrating why trolls are necessary. We are needed to deflate powerful gasbags and remove authority from discussions.</p>

        </div>

        <div>
            <p>Yeah, yeah. That’s what the article was implanting in your head. That’s not what happened at all. There was a heated flame war, and a kid made a lady leave by posting her home address, and she got scared.</p>
            <p>It’s not right, but it’s not a credible threat of rape or murder either. It just is what it is. It also has absolutely nothing to do with internet trolling, which is something extremely good that everyone should do.</p>
            <hr />
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Weev’s actions DID NOT result in a single death threat. The “death threats” were internet nonsense that were separate and independent from the doxxing, and were ongoing before, in the flame war which predated the doxxing.
                You are being misled by the purposefully vague propagandistic phrasing in the article.
            </p>
            <p>The comparison of place and wording is for you to judge. There is a world of difference here, you just can’t see it. In Kuban’s case, something could happen, in weev’s case, realistically speaking, nothing could happen.</p>
            <p>The thing he used to scare her away is PARANOID FEAR of the internet spilling into the real world, a fear everyone knows, and one which is nearly universally unjustified.</p>
            <p>That doesn’t make it right, but it isn’t the same as Kuban, not by a long shot.</p>

            <p>I’m not defending him for posting online info. You are absolutely right, it crossed the line to real-world, it was wrong, it was unethical, it was completely unjustifiable. I agree, I never wavered.</p>
            <p>
                What it was NOT is attempted rape or attempted murder. It just was what it was, an unethical thing which is BAD. NOT AS BAD as rape, murder, credible threat of murder, or credible threat of rape. Just bad in a different,
                lesser, but still bad, way.
            </p>
            <p>But this has nothing to do with trolling, which is what is being attacked in the article. Trolling is GOOD.</p>

                The biggest clue was that if he had actually followed her, stalked her, or threatened her, she would have SAID SO in the article, instead of going on a long rambling diatribe about internet trolls. What is not said is as
                important as what is said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Actually, to tell the truth, I was just guessing. I don’t know anything about this. So I asked myself “what could have possibly happened to lead to this situation”. And then I made assumptions, and stuck with them. This is
                how trolls behave.

        <div>
            <p>That’s just the psyche. The psyche isn’t negligible. But it isn’t RAPE or MURDER nor is it a credible threat of RAPE or MURDER.</p>

        </div>

        <div>
            <p>No, the author is extending the term “troll” to include cyberstalking.</p>
            <hr />
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>Sorry to you bub, it’s internet times, and you can’t stop the freedom.</p>
            <p>1. I do understand the difference between arguing and harassing. Trolling is arguing and Doxxing is harassing. It is the author of this article that conflates the two activities, not me.</p>
            <p>
                2. I indeed do refuse to admit that personal attacks have no place. Personal attacks are essential for exactly one special all-important purpose: Direct personal attacks are the only method which may be effectively used to
                remove authority from a position.
            </p>
            <p>
                Authority is not symmetric. If I come to you with a new idea, for example, that black holes emit matter nothermally (sorry to pick the same stuff every time, but it’s not like I have a hundred new ideas), every article you
                read, every credentialed expert you consult, will tell you that this is false. But suppose it is not false (it is probably true), then it is not a wrong idea, it is just a new idea. How do you argue for such an idea online?
                You will be heckled authoritatively by experts, you will be made to look silly, and ignorant people will oppose you with ridicule, ridicule which will not be called “trolling” because you will be seen as an idiot.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way to make people stop looking at you and at the experts, and look at the evidence, is by direct personal insults. The goal is to remove authority from the authorities, as momentarily happens when they are insulted. You
                have to say “those authorities are bozos, they have no evidence for this”, and then the person will listen to you for a little bit. Then you present the evidence, and let the chips fall where they may. If you are right, you
                have made progress. If the authorities are right, no harm done.
            </p>
            <p>But this simply cannot happen without the direct challenge to authority. This is Galileo’s lesson.</p>
            <p>
                I should point out that authority is sometimes used by someone who MISINTERPRETS what the authority is saying, and then some heckling quickly corrects the misperception. The correction simply does not happen without the
                ridicule. This is the purpose of ridicule, it is why it exists.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. The targets of trolling are ALWAYS those in a position of authority, or those who are arguing in their name online. People who are challenging authority are heckled, but this heckling is simply never called trolling. It
                is called “removing crap”, “cleaning up nonsense”, or “laughing at the yahoos”. It is simply natural for the powerful position to mock, you don’t even notice it when you agree with the position.
            </p>
            <p>4. I don’t insist on the separation. Libel laws and lawsuits are perfectly fine to use for online harassment. I dispute that trolling constitutes any kind of harassment, simply because it doesn’t.</p>
            <p>
                5. Yes, incitement to violence is a serious crime, but that is not what was going on here. What was going on here was an intimidation using apparent incitement. She was not in any significant real danger. It was still
                unethical, it could still be grounds for a lawsuit, but this is not the issue we are talking about. The real harrassment of doxxing is being purposefully conflated with trolling. Trolling is essential. Doxxing is a no-no.
            </p>
            <p>6. I am not only a TROLL SUPPORTER, I am an OUT AND OUT TROLL, and I insist you be one too.</p>

            <p>Nobody is risking their life here. You have to get your head out of your ass to see this.</p>

                Whatever you say. I oppose prison for weev because she didn’t press charges, and he’s already been in prison for absolutely nothing for a long time. If someone passed an anti-doxxing law, I wouldn’t be so adamently against
                it, but I think current law is sufficient to deal with it. Just sue.
            </p>
            <p>I know she felt threatened, I am not disputing it was a bad thing to do. I am disputing that it has anything to do with trolling, or that weev should be publically harassed over this any more than he already has been.</p>

        <div>
            <p>In prison, a swastika tattoo is actually politically helpful, as it allows you to join the racial white gang. This is one of the terrible things about American prisons.</p>
            <p>
                The tattoo is a swastika with pictures of various images from European folklore. I find it oddly interesting, because it focuses on European heritage rather than racial violence, and his racist rants just didn’t manage to
                offend me, as the attacks were always against those he percieved as powerful, not against the powerless. Nazis generally pick on homeless people for racist attacks, not on the lawyers for the prosecution. His method is
                strange. But it’s not my job to judge his politics, and neither is it yours.

            <hr />
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>This is false. Openness means openness, and everyone is free to join. If they feel bullied, that’s not something that one should be concerned about unduly, just point out that this is a natural feeling for everyone.</p>
            <p>
                The internet does produce a much more abrasive discussion than is normal in day-to-day life, but this is also a much more effective discussion in terms of information content, and it is much more accurate when it is left
                alone. If it is made polite, then horrible and offensive lies are produced, and lynch mobs (such as this one) can operate with impunity. The trolls are the immune system of the internet, and if you have the immune system
                ganging up on you, then you need to fight back or give up, according to whether they are right or you are right.
            </p>
            <p>The people who harrass online simply do not have any real-world power. This is a fact. They have no power online either, in the case where they are factually wrong.</p>
            <p>
                When they get attention, it is because their writing makes effective propaganda. Anyone can do it, it just takes a reasonably strong self-image, some actual effort to learn how to do propaganda, and a study of insults and a
                quickly developed thick skin for them. The thick skin is important, as it allows you to venture into new intellectual territory without fear, and without the worry that you’ll get lost and never return to sanity.
            </p>
            <p>
                A black man can go to a KKK site, and they lose their intimidation factor. A Jewish fellow can find out what neo nazis are into, and learn a bit about Odin and Thor. The Odin and Thor business, is important folklore, not
                deemed worth preserving, because both in racist thinking and in anti-racist thinking “whiteness” is not an ethnicity. When you get over past oppression, European culture is a real ethnicity, like any other, and Odin and Thor
                are important.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a level playing field, and it is simply false that the insults are more intimidating to the powerless. They are most intimidating to the powerful, as the constant cogent heckling criticism of the mainstream press by
                the alternative press online, a heckling which is now winning, is the subtext in any such discussion.

                No, no, you little mental-head, this is simply not true. Kuban was posting in a place for sex solicitation, with the intent of producing either an attack or a serious risk of atttack. Our buddy weev was possibly posting
                harassing nonsense together with not-so-sensitive publically available information, in an attempt to scare somebody into going away. Both are bad, but one is a teeny weeny bit worse, doncha think?

            <p>
                The “death threats” were nothing to do with weev, they were people talking trash to her on the thread, because of her support of censorship, with no actual threat of violence, as follows: Raven, you should be humped by a
                chimp and crushed by an elephant. Your remains should be scattered in the ocean, and feed the algae, which would be a step-up, evolutionarily speaking.
            </p>
            <p>Threats of rape and murder. You are free to sic the world on me now.</p>
            <p>The impression you got from reading her piece was different, but this is what was going on.</p>
            <p>
                In any case, this is a pointless conversation, as you are a bit too limited to understand what is going on here. Online, the real concern is the shutting up of suppressed voices, and the silencing of actual forceful dissent.

                I have been kicked out Wikipedia, Stackexchange, and Quora, and there is only one or two blogs or discussion places where I have not been blocked. The discussion here is a typical amount of rudeness from me. The real issue
                is forcefully holding a position, never backing down. In the case of Quora, it was in challenging a personal sob-story directly, to make sure it was honest, and to remove it’s propaganda power so that the events of the
                Boston Bombing can be evaluated with neutrality. All of these are trolling in the broad sense, and this is what is really under attack here, with weev as a poster boy for why “something needs to be done about this”.

                I didn’t bother reading it. I accept that she is likely genuine now. Sorry about being suspicious, but you must understand, people have been lying in this thread, for example, a fellow below who pretended to be a lawyer in
                possession of the doxx (he isn’t). Trolling is the way to get at truth quickly, and I got at the truth— you aren’t making stuff up.
            </p>
            <p>But you are still barking up the wrong tree. Trolling is important, and stalking is a crime, and the two are completely opposite modes of behavior.</p>

                I meant your story is emotionally manipulative, not that you are particularly emotional. I don’t think you are very emotional, you might be a cold-blooded realist posting heart-rending personal stories of persecution to make
                deliberate propaganda.
            </p>
            <p>I call for no solution to this problem, as I don’t see a problem in her case. I see an invented problem. In your case, there might be a problem, but it is not the same problem, and it might be a made up problem.</p>
            <p>
                On the off chance that you seriously are a journalist telling the truth, you should think a little about what makes online discussions more radical than journalism in the New York TImes. You should consider that the New York
                Times published out and out propaganda on yellowcake, WMDs, not to mention the granddaddy of lies, the mentally retarded 9/11 official story.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why did these lies have such a hard time online, when in the media they were dominant? It’s because of trolls continuously attacking them without granting them authority, by mocking. This is scary to established power, so
                they always try to shut it up. It must not be shut up, it must be done doubly hard.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the real problem, and trolling is the solution. The solution to trolling is more trolling, and even more, until the entire corrupt edifices of modern journalism is replaced by something which cusses a whole lot more,
                and cares a whole lot more about accuracy.

                I have to come clean, I posted the doxx. Weev was lying to protect me. He and I had been lovers for a while, then one night he told me about her, and I got jealous, So one night, when I was drunk and stoned, I snuck over to
                his computer and put up the doxx. I regretted it immediately. As I sobbed on the bed, he held me close, stroked the tears off my cheek, and he said he would make it all ok.
            </p>
            <p>
                He claimed credit to deflect attention, and then to protect our secret, he joined a neo-nazi organization, so that nobody would suspect our relationship. It was a brilliant move. Of course, we could never be seen together
                after that. I moved away, to avoid the temptation. He never calls or writes. It was very hard for him to get that tattoo, but he did it anyway, that’s how much he loves me.
            </p>
            <p>People say all sorts of shit online, for rhetorical purposes. For example “I have the doxx right in front of me” (just a few comments above) or “weev is a POS” (everywhere), etc. You can’t take online boasting seriously.</p>
            <p>
                I have never seen a shouting match which ended with a lying position winning out, it simply removes authority from all sides, and then, in the mud, the truth gradually emerges, and then everyone goes home tired and more
                enlightened.

                Einstein was sent worse, he was threatened with death, thugs went through his home, and he could not return to Germany. This was a direct result of his science. His university appointed an anti-Einstein director who openly
                supported the Nazi purges to get rid of the anti-German influence of Jewish positivists and their German counterparts, like Mach and Heisenberg. This is probably the most vicious attack on an intellectual. He was also mocked
                and torn apart in publications, including the famous classic “100 against Einstein” from the 1920s, perhaps you’ve read it.

                Threatening violence online is not ok at all, but it is not really seriously threatening either, and it is stupid and counterproductive. It naturally dies on its own eventually, people stop doing it, because all it does is
                hurt your own cause. It doesn’t do anything except make you look bad and get you ignored.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason it happens is because the internet is extremely violent to ideas, it can topple a long held dogma very quickly. The measures against offensive speech are used to protect powerful positions against dismissive
                ridiculing attack, and this is something that is necessary. Sometimes that means you need to speak out in defense of people who crossed that line to some real world harassment, because if you don’t, that line will gradually
                move to the point where all criticism is squelched.
            </p>
            <p>
                Online threats don’t spill over to the real world except in extraordinarily unusual cases, and this is not one of those cases. It doesn’t need special legal protection or any meddling by the state. This is just the response
                of people who hear a completely uncensored discussion for the first time, and become freaked out, and think ‘oh no, you can’t say THAT, can you?’ Yes you can, and this freedom is what makes the internet different from your
                TV.

                It’s not false advertizing— this was one of the most offensive posts in academically important writing, and it would be thrown out in any forum which disallowed trolling. This is what is really being threatened by linking
                trolling with violence.

                You simply don’t know how many powerful people staked their reputation on microkernels, and how offensive and troll-like Linus Torvalds seemed. He sounded like an out and out bitter young man with a complete lack
                understanding of computer science. This was only belied by the fact that he was objectively right, and he had just written the working and obviously revolutionary Linux kernel.
            </p>
            <p>
                He maintains this honesty, you can google ‘nVidia fuck you’, it is essential. Another such righteous asshole is Lubos Motl. They used to come from the left (like me), but now they come more from the right, I don’t care where
                they come from, I support them either way. I suppose the conservatives are trying to conserve the internet heritage from the 90s, when it was radical.

                The insults is a result of conservative hostility toward feminism. Feminism is a form of Marxism subversion of power structures, and there are powerful opponents for this reason. I have seen feminism defended viciously and
                cogently, it is not so hard to do “The SCUM Manifesto” was probably the first real troll ever written, I consider this one of the best models for what trolling can and should be, and it was written in support of feminism by
                a woman.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since defending feminism is basically defending Karl Marx himself, Feminism is the pinnacle of Marxist thought really, as the power structures touch on our very biology, the same power structures that oppose hackers coalesce
                around feminists. The attacks are stupid lame insults, and overcoming them is trivial. You simply have to challenge male authority more crassly than the anti-feminist trolls. They simply cannot win on a level playing field,
                as they are using social authority as a crutch, and trolling sweeps that crutch right out from under them.
            </p>
            <p>Valerie Solenas showed how to do it by example:</p>
            <p>
                “You would swim through a river of snot, wade through a puddle of diarrhea just to get a chance to screw” “You are an incomplete female, a walking abortion”, etc. This is how you remove male authority, it is no different
                from any other authority, although it seems more menacing for obsolete biological reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                The online hostility is more difficult for those who are more empathetic, this is true, but it is not a serious problem, as a few anti-empathy exercizes can easily cure this. There are fine female trolls, some of the best,
                and the defenses of feminism are ultimately easy, because the feminists are telling the truth.

                Your personal story is emotional, and while it might serve a cathartic purpose for you in dealing with a criminal threat, it also serves a propaganda purpose here, in tugging at the heartstrings of the reader to support
                internet censorship.

                relation between this criminal stalking and what is discussed in the article, which is online speech.

            <p>Sure. There are lots of dogmas in the world, for example</p>
            <p>
                1. 9/11 was done by 19 muslims, not by the coordinator of the military drills of that day.<br />
                2. Petroleum is made from ancient marine plants, not from chemistry in the high-pressure environment of the mantle.<br />
                3. Large classical black holes are purely one-way, and the Cauchy horizon evolves to a spacelike singularity under perturbations.<br />
                4. Cold fusion is a phony phenomenon<br />
                5. Self-modifying computer code is a bad practice<br />
                6. Bourgeoise power structures are necessary and justified so as to produce progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only way to challenge to these dogmas is by a discourse which is open and free, and open to anyone. The internet provides this. On previous media, powerful gatekeepers stopped you from hard criticism, and any new idea
                needed to fight in obscurity for decades to overcome this political authority barrier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hard criticism with insults and ridicule overcomes the authority barrier immediately. But the hard criticism is extremely damaging to abstract power, and leads groups of powerful people to accuse you of trolling, no matter
                what the truth is. This is not an abstract rarefied concern, the accusations of trolling occur when a person who has no power challenges an established authority.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is what happened in this case too. The person writing this article is an authority in her field, the challenge came from a powerless young man seriously lacking in real-world social skills, but strong with the internet
                skills. Using an unusual psychologically intimidating tactic, a tactic which is simply not acceptable (but applied regularly toward the powerless anyway), he intimidated an authority into backing down online.
            </p>
            <p>This was both highly unethical and counterproductive, but it ultimately did not amount to a credible imminent danger to the author, although it felt like that to her, and she is making it feel that way to you.</p>
            <p>
                The article is a propaganda piece with a goal of producing internet restrictions on speech. This cannot be abided, as the internet is valuable precisely because it allows challenge to authority. You may not like it when that
                challenge comes from a person you disagree with who holds obnoxious discredited views, but this challenge is what is most important to preserve. An accepted truth does not need additional external political defense, it can
                defend itself very well, it is established. It is the new truths, the currently unpopular truths, that require defense. To defend them requires a strong defense of those who are putting out unpopular untruths. The method of
                sorting out true from false is a long debate, and trolling is the component that levels out the authority playing field, so that the debate is over the objective evidence, and not over the politics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trolling is the defense of new or marginalized ideas against the authority of those who oppose them. It is the mechanism by which new ideas politically flex their muscles. It does not imply any real-world threat, any such
                real-world association is imaginary in all but a handful of extremely pathological cases, although it does involve a real psychological attack, in that it is attacking world-views which are dominant or popular.
            </p>
            <p>
                One must preserve the right to troll, as it is simply the right to remove authority from those who have power. The propaganda against trolling always comes from established voices with good social skills and a high position,
                because in order to get to an established high position one must forsake hard outsider positions. This is a serious obstacle to the progress of humanity, it must be resisted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Authority is what Galileo was fighting against when he trolled the Aristotelians in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief Systems of the World. Trolling is what Linus Torvalds did to Andrew Tannenbaum in the Operating Systems
                Microkernel debate, the famous Tannenbaum Torvalds debate of 1992. It is what everyone who has a new idea must do to reconfigure authority structures, and preventing it is a serious offense against the internet’s very
                structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you aren’t trolling in defense of a marginalized position you agree with, what the heck is the purpose of your online activity? Supporting the status quo? You don’t need to do support it, it’s already the status quo. The
                internet is for debate over marginalized opinions.

                Weev’s exploit was nothing like Kuban’s, it only psychologically seemed that way to the victim, and she is making it psychologically seem that way to you, using effective emotional writing, aka propaganda. His actions were
                wrong, but they were far less dangerous than Kubans, and there is a propaganda team of nitwits here trying to make it seem different by repetition and mutual masturbation.
            </p>
            <p>
                But this is ultimately ineffectual, because a person who is telling the truth with a few hours to spare can counteract the propaganda by simply standing firmly against it. That person is invariably labelled a troll, I am
                trying to be that person, and the first and most important freedom, the freedom to mount this challenge, is what you are trying to take away.

                The point is that NO TROLLING CAN’T easily turn into those other things, it hardly ever turns into those other things, you have to dig and dig and pretend and exaggerate in order to make it seem so. It is simply PROPAGANDA
                to pretend it can. The examples cited are extremely unusual, even so they are not comparatively damaging compared to real world events, and they are simply being spun and used as a pretext to get less educated people to try

                The threats were largely imaginary, they didn’t really exist as credible imminent threats, as they do when an abusive husband threatens his wife. Doxxing can carry a short prison term, I don’t think that is wrong, although
                this is not what is being discussed here. The doxxing is simply a focus for the propaganda for internet censorship, and the villifying of those who make harsh comments online.
            </p>
            <p>
                The psychological pain that the doxxing caused is real, but here it is used as simple propaganda. The threat was nearly entirely psychological and imaginary. There were no direct real-world threats, only the indirect implied
                threat that those online harrassers would somehow get motivated to use the doxx to seek out and commit violent crimes against a person they don’t personally know living hundreds or thousands of miles away. While there are a
                handful of such mentally disturbed individuals, you can usually count them on the fingers of one hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                This threat is not entirely without cause, it is a real threat, but it is not of the same calibre as a threat from someone you have a real-world interaction with, as there is simply no reasonable expectation that there is
                any motive or ability here to commit any violent crime. The threats in the real world are simply much more serious than this.
            </p>
            <p>The context of this discussion is to mount a propaganda war against a politically unpopular powerless hacker with extremely offensive views. I don’t like this context.</p>
            <p>
                The other context of this discussion is that internet discussions are problematic because they are dominated by trolls. I vehemently disagree with this, because it is the long trolling which is the only useful thing in the
                internet discussions. The trolls are challenging the authority of experts, they are challenging the powerful dogmas at the basis of our knowledge/ structure, and one must confront each such challenge so that progress can

                Mark Twain used to say “What gets us in trouble isn’t the things we don’t know, but the things we know that just ain’t so”. A troll is someone who is trying to tell you that a thing you know just ain’t so. He might be wrong,
                in which case you can demonstrate it, but rarely, this troll is right, and then you have had a breakthrough.
            </p>
            <p>
                These breakthroughs simply require uncensored no-holds-barred debate, as you see in the Tannenbaum Torvalds debate, or in the physics literature disputes regarding string theory. There is no substitute for this
                power-challenging attacks, they are the only mechanism to dismantle the authority from an idea.
            </p>
            <p>If the idea is correct, it will withstand the challenge, and regrow it’s authority quickly. It is for the cases where the idea is incorrect that the freedom must be preserved.</p>

                Weev is a powerless fellow using dirty methods to win propaganda wars at any cost, including psychologically disturbing borderline criminal activity. This is not necessary, it is counterproductive. All you need to do is tell
                the truth bluntly, and seek no compromise. But his example is used to chill speech in general, and this one cannot abide.

                I would be scared too, of course. It’s not right. But the level of threat is not the same as death threats, or following, or any real world threatening activity. This stuff is deadly serious, and the internet stuff is a
                psychological war of attrition.

                internet censorship, it must be resisted, without facts, simply by repeatedly confronting it head on, with no regard for the loss of credibility or bad association one endures.

                about weev, except to the extent that he is being prosecuted unfairly.

                The scientific community works in exactly this way, you just don’t have enough experience with it. The insults are much more subtle of course, and the threats are to livelihood and professional advancement, not threats of
                death and rape, but the situation is entirely analogous.
            </p>
            <p>
                The insults and ridicule are not subtle, they are just mostly in one direction, from the established authoritative idea towards any challenger. The reverse criticism is not tolerated except online, and it is essential to
                have, as it is the only way to produce new ideas and let them win politically.
            </p>
            <p>
                The internet most certainly does operate this exact same way in every case where it is uncensored. The only censorship required is to remove off-topic or libelous postings, so to remove doxxing. The censorship meted out for
                “trolling” is absurd, and it is always counterproductive.
            </p>
            <p>
                The censorship of online media is a grave threat, a much worse one than weev can ever pose to anyone. Kathy does propose online censorship, her condoning of the practice is exactly what began the hostile confrontation which
                led to this mess. Her current article is simply more arguments in favor of more censorship, and they must be resisted, resisted more or less like the Roman empire was resisted, by throwing your body to the lions.

        <div>
            <p>The truth in the Sierra case is that comment censorship is unacceptable, and she proposed and condoned it, and still does, despite her denials.</p>
            <p>The truth in the epileptic forum case is that malicious people can actually induce epileptic siezures using moving gifs.</p>
            <p>
                Both are important to know, even though the method used in both cases was unnecessarily threatening. Ultimately, both threats are easily neutralized and dealt with, while the benefit from disseminating the truth, and
                allowing it to be disseminated without limitations outweighs other considerations, which have been embellished in this case by effective propaganda.

                It’s true, these things are rare. You only think they are common because you remember them when you see them. The place where they are rarest is on serious discussion forums dedicated to such things, with open access, for
                example, Wikipedia talk pages in the days when they were uncensored.

                The authoritative position was “microkernels are superior”. Linus Torvalds’ position is “No, they’re not. Poopyface.” Linus won, because he was right, and because he gave the official position the zero credibility it
                deserved. Nobody takes microkernels seriously anymore.

                I disagree, you are lying just as much as Queod Quodington above. These things do not lead to real world violence, just the opposite, they mitigate it, by allowing the powerless to speak out and be heard, and to debate on a
                level playing field with the powerful. This levelling effect is why the free speech is being attacked, there is no violence associated with fora.

            <p>
                Trolling cannot kill positive things, it has never done this. Trolling against string theory can be countered by two minutes of trolling for string theory. The trolling of the lynch mob sicced on weev here can be cured by a
                few minutes of trolling against it, as I am trying to demonstrate.

            <p>This is simply false. The alternative viewpoint the racist trolls produce is the RACIST viewpoint, which a decent person is simply never exposed to in ordinary life, except by seeking it out, which never happens.</p>
            <p>
                By listening and understanding the racist viewpoint, a lot of subtle racism in mass media is exposed, because you learn what racism really sounds like and what the racism really is. There are subtle racist things that were
                not picked up on in the past, like the “magic negro” or the “soft bigotry of low expectations”, in George W. Bush’s favorite phrase, which were clarified by out an out racists explaining themselves online. These are now
                regularly identified by the public, and called out for what they are— racism.
            </p>
            <p>
                The racist comments may be deleted when they are off-topic, there is nothing wrong with that. But they are simply bringing up one particularly unpopular and particularly heinous point of view, and on usenet, you could always
                get rid of the racists by heckling quicker than they could produce their nonsense.

                5 years is usually the sentence meted out for conspiracy to murder. In this case, the inciting was ineffectual, as it requires that a rapist read and act upon the comment, he didn’t hire somebody to commit the rape, he
                suggested it on a much more dangerous internet forum than this one.
            </p>

                Your comment above is an example of the type of heckling meted out as propaganda against those who hold unpopular opinions. In this case, the opinion isn’t particularly unpopular, so your attempted attack is ineffectual, but

            <p>IT WASN’T JUSTIFIED. Doxxing is never justified. People do wrong things sometimes.</p>
            <p>But the person who did it wasn’t even necessarily him, he might have simply been lying, falsely taking credit for doxxing her. He has done that in the past regarding other hacks that he knew no one else would claim.</p>
            <p>He also might have done it. I don’t know. It’s not my job to judge him, and might I suggest it is not your job either. Why are we doing it here?</p>

            <p>I DON’T BELIEVE YOU HAVE THE DOXX. Can you post the MD5 sum?</p>
            <p>Regarding your comments, I accept this threat model is true of traditional interactions. Threats can be credible in the real world.</p>
            <p>
                However it is simply not true that all online idle threats can be construed to automatically turn into actual live threats through the action of posting the dox. There is simply no credible motive or opportunity for
                real-world violence in an international forum, with participants often thousands of miles away, and nearly always hundreds of miles away, with no expectation of violence, and with no financial or personal motive, other than
                impersonal insults to pet ideas. It is ludicrous to assume this, it has never happened, and it will never happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                While it is true that the fellow is doing something I consider highly unethical by doxxing, that does not make him automatically liable for all the idle threats which were posted in the weeks before, which were clearly made
                with no intention of actually carrying them out. He would be liable only for the direct threat of the dox, the potential of a homocidal or sociopathic reader (although the probability is small, it is not zero) and for the
                harm caused by justifiable fear of such a person.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this, he is liable, and he can be sued for damages. I don’t think this is inappropriate, I would take such action myself. Perhaps with proper legislation against doxxing, he can even be prosecuted, although I would not
                support this legislation if you ask my opinion, as I think the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt is simply never going to be met.
            </p>
            <p>But this is NOT THE TOPIC OF THE DISCUSSION.</p>
            <p>
                The topic of the discussion is the censorship of online forums. There is simply nothing in this case that leads one to think that this is necessary or advisable. Online forums are useful because they are free speech, and
                free of real-world violence, or repercussions. They are simply abstract discussions of ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                The use of harsh language, and threats in such a forum constitutes a rhetorical device, plain and simple, and it is simply a mistake of context to ever construe such a thing as a direct threat or call to action against an
                individual. It is designed to offset imbalance in authority, so that an individual with no standing to argue is equally visible as an individual with authority. That is, until the exchange terminates, and one side has been
                refuted.
            </p>
            <p>
                This discourse is unprecedented, because it is quite rude, and it is free of the strictures of tradtional authority. This is what makes internet discourse invaluable. Any attempt to rid the internet of “trolling” (unlike,
                say, an attempt to rid the internet of doxxing) would jeopardize the very essence of the new medium, it would transform it into just another platform for government and business, rather than the public open platform for
                individuals which it has been since its inception.

            <p>I am not ok with censoring anybody. If he does crap like doxxing, just sue him. If he makes real-world threats, arrest him. It’s not an argument for censoring the internet, and it will never be.</p>

                The cause is ensuring a free internet for all. You guys with your coordinated tag team comments are crazy. I am a sincere person trying to keep the internet open. There was no actual imminent threat from the discussions EVEN
                WITH THE DOXXING. The doxxing is unethical, but this is no cause for censorship of discussions, but simply for a lawsuit.

            <p>I DON’T CONDONE DOXXING! I NEVER DID. IT IS A BAD THING TO DO. I SAID THIS TWENTY TIMES.</p>
            <p>Doxxing has nothing to do with what you call “verbal abuse”. The accusation of verbal abuse can come (and has come) for the following actions:</p>
            <p>
                1. Showing someone who thinks they are an expert that their optics solution approximation is incorrect.<br />
                2. Pointing out that the Drude model of electron flow is obsolete.<br />
                3. Explaining that Neitzsche was a racist writer.<br />
                4. Explaining the abiogenic theory of petroleum formation.<br />
                5. Describing the S-matrix theory of hadronic processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                etc. etc. Although these look like safe topics, they are all hotly disputed, and taking the wrong side, an arguing forcefully against the other side brings up accusations of “trolling”, “dishonesty”, “crackpottery”,
                “creating bad vibes” and finally “verbal abuse” in this order, leading to censorship of these scientific topics, and leading to mistakes in the peer review process online.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason is simply POWER. Criticism from powerless to the powerful is simply always percieved as rude when it does not seek compromise, while criticism the other way is never percieved as rude, period. This imbalance is
                compensated by rude speech online, i.e. by trolling.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is exactly what is happening in this case too. The powerless person is this weev fellow, the powerful person is his opponent who wrote the article, and the mud she is throwing at him sticks, which includes accusations
                of threats of rape, threats of murder, when all that she has grounds to suspect him of is the doxxing. Doxxing is NOT threat of rape or murder.
            </p>
            <p>My position is that you can’t censor online discussions period. Any attempt to do so must therefore show some sort of real world danger, and this person is claiming such a danger. I dispute this claim.</p>
            <p>I agree that doxxing is a reprehensible thing, she should sue. She should press charges. But she didn’t. Instead she is proposing to censor online discussions. This is not about the doxxing anymore, but about censorship.</p>
            <p>Further, the fact that doxxing is a terrible thing to do does not mean that you get to do unlimited propaganda against this guy. You don’t even know for sure he did it, he has boasted of hacks he didn’t do before.</p>
            <p>
                I am afraid of the chilling effect of making this guy a test case, or tearing his reputation apart (more than he has done himself, that is). He is an unpopular jerk, just like the person who attacks the drude model, defends
                abiogenic petroleum, attacks Nietzsche, points out mistakes in not using optical Fresnel equation approximation methods, and that’s ME. I’m acting out of self-interest here. You can’t see it, because you don’t have enough
                experience with internet censorship. It is simply never necessary.
            </p>
            <p>She should sue him, prosecute him, ask him to apologize, or leave him alone. This type of thing is simply propaganda.</p>

                I have no serious problem with the criminal prosecution of this case. It bears no resemblance to the case we are talking about here, as the context is worlds apart. Craigslist is a forum for real-world interactions, and
                people are looking for real world interaction in the same geographical region.
            </p>
            <p>
                The context of the doxxing was an international flame war, between parties who are geographically remote. In this case, nobody is looking for real world anything, it would require extreme contortions to make anything
                real-world happen, and there is zero motivation for such a thing. I am sorry, but be realistic, there is simply zero chance of a real world encounter, and there is no real motive for hostility.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is impossible to imagine that a violent confrontation could ever happen from anything that went on in a discussion forum, no matter how hostile. I think if you posted the same craigslist comment, with all it’s malice and
                violence, on a discussion forum, you would also get zero responses. It’s not a real-world thing, it doesn’t spill over.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know the purpose of this was to create fear. It was frightening for sure, I would be scared too. I am saying that the threat was psychological and not imminent, and there was no real danger, although psychologically it
                didn’t feel that way (it wouldn’t to me either).
            </p>
            <p>
                Further, I have to tell you that you are not a judge or a jury, you have not seen the doxx, you have not been presented unbiased evidence with representation for both sides, you don’t even know if he even posted the material
                (your evidence for this is his demonstrably unreliable bragging), and you have made assumptions of harm by associations and extrapolations that are suggested by the original author of the post above, who is also the victim,
                so you really aren’t getting two sides of the story here.
            </p>
            <p>This is simply the behavior of a lynch mob sicced against a fellow who has negative political skills and cannot defend himself. How can you justify this? You know nothing, and you are standing in judgement.</p>
            <hr />
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>I am not sure I believe you have the doxx. How did you get it? Could you demonstrate it in some way? I really don’t believe you, I think you are simply making more propaganda.</p>
            <p>
                I know there is an association between REAL WORLD threats and REAL WORLD violence. I am telling you, “professional in this field”, that the association between online threats between strangers on internet discussion fora and
                real-world violence, is nil. The flame wars you see on sites like this have never led to a single case of real world violence, simply because there is no motivation or opportunity for it to ever happen, even in cases where
                doxxing has occured. It is not right, it is unethical, and it deserves a lawsuit, but I don’t see a credible realistic threat there. People just let out steam in hostile comments, there is some bad feeling, it goes away, and
                this activity is essential, as it is the mechanism of producing truth. I WISH everyone did it! As it stands, it is not the norm.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will not accept your expertise blindly. I would like you to demonstrate that there is a real-world violence threat from online discussion fora before imposing restrictions on these. I simply dogmatically don’t believe it
                is possible for these discussions to spill over into real world confrontation, as there is no mechanism for it to happen.
            </p>
            <p>Any credible threat I see only appears in real world sites, where people actually exchange goods and services, or meet in person.</p>
            <hr />

                It’s obviously worth more than the stance of an insincere “free speech” hypocrit who refuses to support speech he does not like. Neo Nazi speech is not even close to the most offensive speech I have heard, there was speech
                on usenet that would make a typical neo-nazi’s blood curdle with horror. I defend that speech too, although some of it gave me nightmares.
            </p>
            <hr />
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                That’s definitely a crime, but the sentencing was perhaps excessive (although in this case, it does not chill anything, the impact on normal speech is nil). It depends on the credibility of the threat, obviously this one was
                taken seriously (I can’t judge, I don’t know). It is credible when there is an actual threat. I don’t see how such a thing could happen on a site with no real-world content, you are speaking about hypotheticals, and
                hypotheticals make bad law.
            </p>
            <p>
                In our case, I didn’t see an actual threat, simply accusations of such. One must be careful here not to punish offensive speech, rather to punish threatening behavior, and to do so fairly and uniformly. Civil liability seems
                the best recourse.

                The powerless folks who are in danger of state persecution require protection from internet lynch mobs. His “lynch mob” posed no credible threat to Karen, that was all in her head. It was not right, it was scary, it caused
                her distress, and perhaps she should sue him.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if she decides not to sue him, there is no reason for her to sic an internet lynch mob on him, when it he is threatened with the very real threat of real-world prosecution. He is not the powerful one here, his only
                presence is online.

        <div>
            <p>My position is that you don’t know anything, since you didn’t see the doxx. There might have been no SSN in there, I don’t know, and neither do you. You have no more information than I do.</p>
            <p>
                You also don’t know who posted that doxx. You are inferring this from public boasts of an unreliable source. He might not have even posted it, he might have just bragged about it, like he bragged about hacking AT&amp;T when
                it wasn’t him.
            </p>
            <p>And still, without any evidence, without anything but innuendo, you persist is villifying this guy, simply because he is a JERK, because he is unpopular. No, no. That’s not acceptable.</p>
            <p>
                Further it is also my position that this is a hatchet job on rude internet discourse, based on nonexistent associations with real-world violence. There was no credible threat of violence to this woman, and her piece is
                making innuendo to suggest that there was for the purpose of instituting internet censorship. This is abominable.

                It isn’t AT ALL fine to dox. It’s unethical, it’s a completely crappy thing to do. But I am not sure if this guy did it, or just boasted about it, and also I am sure it doesn’t deserve criminal prosecution, rather civil
                liability is the proper recourse, so that she can sue him for damages, and I would suggest that perhaps she should win her lawsuit. It’s an easier burden of proof anyway, she probably can manage it.
            </p>
            <p>
                But that’s not what this article is about. It’s about censoring discussions because they might offend people, by linking offense to real-world danger. There is no real-world danger, this is just a figment of this lady’s
                imagination.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, trolls are often bullies, but so what? You can’t handle being bullied? It’s online, no harm will come to you, guaranteed. These bullies clarify discussions, because there is no better way to get rid of preconceptions
                than to have a bullying person argue something that 99% of the world doesn’t believe. You need to consider the idea, see whether it’s wrong or right, confront the alien world view head on, and if it’s incorrect, you can
                bully right back, and even harder, with true statements that make the bully realize they are wrong. It’s not so easy, because you need to actually think about the idea, it is forced upon you. But doing this, you learn to
                distinguish between ridiculous social consensus and objective truth, you see the difference, and it makes you a better scientists (if that’s what you are).
            </p>
            <p>
                Since I respect science, and since this type of bullying is exactly how consensus is produced in science, I cannot accept it being villified. The arguments for relativity, or for string theory, went through the same hazing
                in the professional literature, except there is mathematics in there coding the insults so that they are harder to see.

                It takes nothing to succeed as a professional in tech, except being in the right social class or getting in that class through assiduous copying of rich people, then reading many other poor people who had original ideas,
                then parrotting these people while claiming the ideas as your own. You then will get praised for innovation. This is the tried and true method in the US. And then people wonder why so few Americans want to be engineers or
                scientists. Would you purposefully work hard so as to have your idea ripped off by a bourgeoise idiot?

                Doing original work is damn hard, harder than you think by a factor of 100, and it requires many years of total commitment with absolutely zero payoff. To produce a good mathematical work, or a good engineering breakthrough,
                is comparable to climbing Mt. Everest alone. Further, you will, if you have a really important idea, certainly get ripped off by the worthless social schmoozers mentioned above, it is nearly inevitable. They will be of the
                right social class, you will not. They will have time to persuade others, you won’t. Because you are expending 100 times more effort than they are on internal development, and you just don’t have time to learn to win friends
                and influence people.

                I know enough about what was going on at SUN, as these corporations produced the Sun UNIX, and other corporate UNIX. After it was a corporate behemoth, it produced the same garbage as all the other corporate behemoths. All
                that corporate crap is dead now, because we have Linux, which was produced by two independent free-thinkers who lived on the margins. Richard Stallman who slept in his office (until he got his MacArthur) and Torvalds, who
                was a student, both working hard in isolation for a long time.

                Sierra did nothing original of any importance. She worked at the corporate heirarchy, and developed some of that Java mess, and wrote “design patterns” of some kind or another, which is not something I appreciate as
                important. It looks like negative progress to me, it’s bourgeoise nonsense.

                I am parrotting weev because I AGREE with him. He is right about this, and no neo-nazi or nazi-sympathizer could possibly ever see this, because it’s ultimately a pure Marxist insight. This is why I don’t buy his nazi
                bullshit, no matter what he says about it. It looks like a total put-on.

                The work of Daubechies, Bruhat and Vogtman is not irrelevant, as it required actual hard creative work in isolation. I met one of them (Vogtman) and she was amazing. The creative work is not the only work that is needed,
                other work is important too, but it is the work that is not cookie cutter, this is the stuff that absolutely requires an individual to stretch outside the mainstream, and leave the culture entirely behind. This is what weev
                is trying to do, although I hope he finds less abrasive ways to do it (weev, dude, please, please, knock it off with the Jew business— it really gets under my skin for obvious reasons).

                I find it hard to believe Rebecca Schaeffer was singled out for pissing off somebody on an online forum. She was obviously stalked because she was on TV, and had a tremendous amount of mass-media visibility. There are ZERO
                victims of online forum harassment, not a single one.

                Jeffrey Dahmer was the exception, and this was in the early 1990s. He was no good on the forum, and he eventually got sick of it. People were certainly sick of him. Rather, more correct to say, nobody noticed him, he was
                just the worst writer there by a long shot. No psychopath is a decent writer, at least not while the psychopathology is active. Valerie Solenas was a good writer before she became a psychopath, but that was a long time
                before her breakdown.

                It’s all harmless, none of it is dangerous to people. It is simply dangerous to wrong ideas, because they are torn apart by trolls. Like me. You need us, you know, because otherwise you would be swimming in the same sea of

                There are rare cases of outright racist or sexist comments online, which are quickly met with a wall of hostile outrage by anti-racist trolls. People just don’t do it very often on uncensored fora. They do it only when they
                can control the content to exclude anti-racist comments, which make racist comments go like molasses. The racists and sexist never got the upper hand on uncensored fora, they got hammered on it right from the beginning, in
                usenet times. It was one of the things that made it clear the internet was very useful as a mechanism of social justice.

                He knew the effect of his actions— he knew that she would get SCARED, and that NO ONE would do JACK to her. Why? Because nobody ever does jack with this crap, there’s no money in it, there’s no motive to do anything, and
                psychopaths don’t seek out victims by perusing the latest flame-wars.

                Online stalking is not real stalking. There is no Manson here, because there are no drug-crazed followers, nor personal influence, nor any actual violent criminal activities at all. People on the internet have no real world
                power to effect criminal activity. They can harmlessly prank someone, as this guy did, and scare them witless. That’s all he can do, and that’s all he did. It’s not right, but it posed no credible threat to her.
            </p>
            <p>
                The invention of bogus real-world threats is simply to whip up a frenzy for internet censorship, which is the kiss of death. I won’t support it under any circumstances, and I consider you a traitor to the internet for even

            <p>The aversion to bourgeoise class power is present in all techies, even if they don’t know what it is. It’s why so many were sympathetic to socialism, and why the USSR despite all it’s weakness, was a tech powerhouse.</p>

                Not false. Nobody is motivated enough to do anything criminal with the information, as there is NO MONEY IN IT, nor is there any BENEFIT TO IT, and all the people involved, due to the self-selection on online forums are
                LITERATE and SANE. Rapists don’t go looking at the list of latest internet grudges and flame wars when picking their victims, and actual murderers need a real motive. What you are talking about is just a stupid game with
                fear and emotion.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am 100% sure on this, as I have been involved in internet discussions which ACTUALLY briefly involved one psychopathic cannibalistic mass-murderer (Jeoffrey Dahmer), and several drug deranged folks, back in usenet days on
                alt-tasteless. There is NOTHING in the modern internet which can compare to the level of profanity and hostility in 1994 alt tasteless, or to the type of comments posted on a daily basis. Look it up and check for yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                I met Mr. Alt-Tasteless 1994 in 1995 in person, we had a beer, and the conversation cause me mental disturbance for weeks and months. He was an EMT, and he described things that no human being should ever see. Many of the
                folks (not me) had drug habits which were mind-melting.
            </p>
            <p>
                The actual psychopath’s postings were so stupid and banal, nearly al of them were lost forever, as nobody thought they were interesting enough to save. These posts described actual horrifying murders in gruesome detail,
                although at the time, people simply thought they were extremely unimaginative illiterate nonsense.
            </p>
            <p>
                You need to learn to distinguish between internet writing and reality. They don’t intersect today, and in the incredibly rare case that they do, real psychopathology is invisible, because it’s drowned out by good punchy
                writing about psychopathology.

                It’s not about elite, dude. It’s about the hard work required to produce new technical stuff. It’s not the same kind of work as the social schmoozing and ass-kissing you use to rise up corporate ranks, and in fact, the two

                It is not clear that the harassment was done by weev, nor was there a “campaign”, there was one doxing and a Craigslist prank of some kind, neither of which produced a credible threat to her safety or her families safety
                (although it was unethical and deplorable, because it induced paranoid fear).
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s not about me or weev, it’s anyone who works hard to do actual original technical work, including Yvonne Choquet Bruhat, Karen Vogtman, Ingrid Daubechies, and many others. This is completely different kind of work than
                becoming a “known and trusted expert” or becoming a wealthy successful businessperson. It’s producing work so radical and important that you are LAUGHED AT and THROWN OUT of companies, like Daubechies was for her
                revolutionary work on wavelets. Daubechies wasn’t appreciated for more than a DECADE, you understand. This is the kind of harassment that trolls fight against, they fight against the power-structure of the bourgoisie, the
                orders that always oppress and suppress new mathematics and new science, and new computer science.

                She did have something wrong done to her, but it is not 100% clear that it was something criminal, nor is it 100% clear that it was done by the fellow she is propagandizing against. Also, it is clear that her complaints are
                with the rude online culture in general, a culture which I believe one must defend to the death.

                Following my own internet upbringing, and also the Sieg-Heiling David Bowie, Nazi themes are fair game, so long as you aren’t picking on powerless people. That’s exactly what he’s doing, which is far beyond the type of
                transgression I could have imagined possible 20 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                These transgressive exercizes are the proper way to leave the mainstream behind so that you can search for something new. Racist talk was something one could not really do in the past, because the power imbalances just did
                not allow one to joke about racism, with all the real racists still running around. There really are only a handful of real nazis left, and I’m pretty sure that deep down this guy is not one of them. Nazis don’t admire

                There are two consequences here. The first one is that this guy was just released from prison on a technical point of evidence. He was in SOLITARY CONFINEMENT for dubiously illegal internet activities, for MONTHS. You
                wouldn’t last five days. He was deprived of reading material and writing material, and his lawyer confidentiality was breached. This is serious, and it is potentially grounds for a successful lawsuit, if his character is

                damage, and this is not appropriate. Just leave him alone, and pick on someone else who is not being hounded by the government. If she wants to press charges, let her do that. This is just making propaganda.

                Since this discussion is all about unsettling internet speech, perhaps it would be best to inject as much emotion as possible into it, to give a series of examples of exactly what gigantic chunk of our internet heritage we
                would lose if trolling were banned.

            <p>She spun a doxxing into a rape threat, something which nobody can say with a straight face. She just implied it through innuendo and indirection, so I know it didn’t happen.</p>

                No, dude. I am not nice, and I don’t want others to be nice. I want people to be free. Profanity is the most effective tool in dismantling obnoxious authority. White men don’t fare any better in online shouting matches than
                anyone else. Women don’t do too badly either, if they are sufficiently profane. The people who do badly are those of HIGH CLASS, and HIGH BREEDING. Those are the people that this type of internet censorship is trying to
                protect.

            <p>Because you don’t know what he did! You don’t know anything. You are INFERRING what he did from a malicious propagandistic testimony designed to smear him.</p>
            <p>He may have doxxed her, or he may have LYINGLY boasted about doxxing her. He has claimed hacks he didn’t do in the past.</p>
            <p>But it doesn’t matter, this is not the smear I am talking about. The smear is making a propaganda painting to make his online potential doxxing activity look like it involved any credible threat whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
                There was no threat here at all, beyond the fear it induced in her mind. This fear she is inducing in your mind, so suddenly you are just as angry at him as she was. There was no stalking, there were no real threats, it was
                all online nonsense like you have seen a million times, when user A threatens user B that he will rip his guts out of his belly and feed it to him. That’s the kind of threat you are talking about.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your anger and malice is just pure evil, and collective evil, a lynch mob evil. Unlike his non-threat to her, you pose an actual threat to him, as he is being targeted by the state for incarceration, and is susceptible to
                this political nonsense attacks.

                get all paranoid, because sudenly all the potential threats become real in your mind, because “Oh no! Oh no! They know my address”.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here’s the thing she didn’t realize: nobody cares about you! Nobody is going to follow you, nobody is going to threaten you, nobody is going to hurt you. It’s a psychological ploy to scare you, that’s all it was. It worked.
            </p>
            <p>It was never anything more, and I know, because she never said it was anything more in this article. She tried to imply it like all heck, with weasel words and double speak, but she didn’t say it.</p>
            <p>I know enough to know why she didn’t say it. She didn’t say it because it wasn’t true. Nobody did anything to her, and there was no credible threat.</p>

            <p>This is false! How do you debate holocaust deniers? You do it LIKE A TROLL.</p>
            <p>
                You say “Here, asswipe, are the deportation records from Hungary. Here, turd-fucker, is the testimony of a Treblinka guard” and so on and so on, you can respond to all their arguments completely, while at the same time
                denying them any respect or credibility!
            </p>
            <p>That’s EXACTLY why trolling is so important to preserve— you can use it to knock down arguments WITHOUT giving them authority or respect as you are doing so.</p>
            <p>It is exactly for this reason that the internet killed holocaust denial. The centers for Holocaust remembrance were able to respond to the points with enough disrespect to make it clear they did not deserve much respect.</p>
            <p>
                It is for exactly the same reason that you need to preserve freedom of speech online, because, in other situations, not the holocaust, the holocaust deniers are the powerful ones, and the persons trying to call attention to
                the thing are dismissed. You must not rob them of the tools of disrespect an mockery, even using the most offensive trollish language you can imagine, and then some!

                He didn’t do this, he just posted some information he found online. You are inferring that he did, as you were meant to, from the article’s long stream of suggestive innuendo and propaganda, which is designed to paint a
                picture of a stalker, without actually saying it. The article doesn’t come out say it because it simply isn’t true.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is why the article is so long-winded and has such gas-baggy phrasing, she can’t out and out say he was following her, because he really wasn’t. She’s was never that important, nobody followed her or threatened her in
                her real-life world. People just got pissed off at her and flamed her online.
            </p>
            <p>
                What he did is post some personal information stuff he dug up on her on an online forum. It might not even have really been him, he might have just boasted about doing it to falsely take credit from someone else (he has done
                this before regarding some other hacking claims, for notoriety purposes).
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s not like the guy who really posted it will say “Hey, weev, no! no! That was me! I did it.” They’d be happy that he’s taking the credit for this. He likes attention. He also might have done it too, I don’t know and I
                don’t care. I don’t like speculating about other people I don’t know anything about, and I certainly don’t follow a lynch mob sicced on them like you have been doing.

                through a lady who is purposefully and maliciously linking it to heinous crimes like murder and rape by suggestion and innuendo. It is a trial of sorts, and you are revealing yourselves to have lost your minds and lost your

            </p>
            <p>He should be left alone, and all of you should crawl back into your holes. He should also say “sorry” to the lady for having done that bad thing, and she should say “it’s ok, it’s all over now.”</p>

            <p>
                He is being compared to rapists, those who threaten murder, etc, for internet activity which is miles removed from any of this. His reputation is being dragged through the mud, purposefully, by hearsay derived from the
                testimony of powerful idiots, and without any trial, simply through a lynch mob of malicious malcontents who don’t know fuck all about him or his accuser.
            </p>
            <p>That includes me, of course, I don’t know fuck all about any of this. But I AM NOT MALIGNING HIM, OR HIS ACCUSER, you see. I just try to stop YOU from doing it, you vicious asshole.</p>

                Trolls are not really bullies, they are simply removing authority from discussions, so that your status no longer matters, and politeness becomes a deteriment to your argument. This allows quick progress to the truth, and it
                is the principle that the internet is founded on. This principle is preserved where there are “righteous assholes”, like Linus Torvalds for the Linux Kernel mailing list, or Richard Stallman for GNU. Physicists pioneered
                this anti-authoritative discourse, it was especially popular in the Soviet physics school.

        <div>
            <p>
                It is the exact opposite— good trolls brought more people than they drove away. The ones driven away were simply the ones who couldn’t respond to the harshly worded attacks, because they were IGNORANT. This has the effect of
                inverting traditional power-structures, and it made truth win out in cases which had been problematic in the published literature for decades.

                No, no. In the 90s, people saw that on the internet, you could say “You turd-mouthed rat-faced skunk-fucker” to a top notch professor, and nobody could stop you! This made it possible to challenge authoritative statements,
                and it is still possible, so long as trolling is not forbidden.
            </p>
            <p>
                This heckling is what allows movements to slowly gain power, and it is extremely important to preserve. It also scares people with money, and people in government shitless, because they can’t abide mockery, and they want to
                make sure that writing is sanitized for approval. This is why protecting weev is so important.

                propaganda. He might be lying, he might not, it is secondary consideration. The primary consideration is that there is an internet lynch mob sicced on him, and this must be resisted.

            <p>
                This article and comment thread is far worse than what weev has been accused of doing. There are propaganda minded folks here actively campaigning to destroy his life, people who don’t even know him, and have no way of
                getting the full story, except through rumor and innuendo, who have decided to silence and bury him forever. Not using imaginary threats from imaginary friends, like he is imagined to have done, but using the all-too-real
                power of the state.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are forming a group-minded lynch mob, using innueno, rumors, phony consensus, fake grass-roots, and making a vicious smear campaign with anonymous spiteful malcontents deliberately engaged in character assassination of
                someone they have never met. This bears a closer resemblance to actual Nazi persecution, more so than anything he is accused of doing. You call him a neo-nazi, because he has a swastika tatooed on his chest. His tattoo is
                only skin deep. You have a swastika tatooed on your hearts.

                Him being a neo nazi is not enough to persecute the guy. Can’t you see that you are engaged in a campaign of character assassination against a person you don’t even know? I have no sympathy for neo nazis, but what I read of
                his does not read like a neo nazi, but a very good troll who is manipulating imagery in a very nice way.

                I just read the article. Ok, I am Jewish, and relatives of mine were murdered and enslaved. He thinks I am, with my Jewish cohorts, engaged in a conspiracy to get him. I don’t know why, but it doesn’t make me upset. I know
                why now, it’s because he’s always attacking BASTARDS IN POWER, not powerless people as real nazis do.

                I’m sorry, but ultimately, I know a smear campaign when I smell one, and this one reeks to high heaven. He doesn’t deserve this, he did offensive things, but probably not criminal things. He should grow up, meet a nice
                Jewish girl and have some children.

                I am ignorant, sure, but I don’t believe you or her. The reason is that people say “I think you should be dropped out of an airplane for suggesting comment moderation, an I hope you land on a cactus” on an internet forum,
                and if you insist on doing propaganda with this, you could call that a “death threat”, it sounds like one doesn’t it? Except we all know it’s not.
            </p>
            <p>
                I won’t know from talking to you, frankly, because I don’t trust your reporting. This is a propaganda smear campaign against an individual, so I can’t trust you, sorry. If you were more honest, in a verifiable way, and
                honestly explained the actual details of the death threat, I would be more likely to be persuaded, but honestly, there’s very little you can say, as I decided from the main body of the article that this is a bunch of
                bullshit propagana directed at someone somebody powerful doesn’t like.

                No, he didn’t contradict himself. Trolling is a sacrament, as it is the only tool to oppose government and corporate propaganda. In this case, you have a person who is easy to dislike, but he is the exception, not the rule,
                and he seems to be the target of an active smear campaign.

                If he is lying, which I am not 100% sure about, he is lying so as to avoid the wave of persecution and prosecution directed against him, for example, right here. Remember that he might have been lying the first time, when he
                obliquely didn’t deny the doxxing. People sometimes aren’t so honest, and take credit for things they didn’t do. People also sometimes lie about things they did do. I don’t know, and I don’t care.
            </p>
            <p>
                The doxxing is a really unethical thing, it was extremely stupid, but whoever did it was just being an idiot. Who the heck would do anything to this harmless patzer who wrote the article? She is paranoid sure, so am I, isn’t
                everybody? I also would hate to get doxxed. But there’s little one can do about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The doxxer didn’t get the information by hiring a PI or following her around, he found it on the internet. The association with rapists, murderers, and so on is not appropriate, as I didn’t see a claim that there was any of
                that, except by innuendo. The association with malicious eplepsy inducing people is just a smear.
            </p>
            <p>
                If it was him, as best as I can see (with a minute’s reading), his motivation seems to have been retaliation for doxxing of others. Doxxing just shouldn’t happen, and retaliating with more doxxing is absurd, and only makes
                you into a complicit supporter of the practice. But this guy sounds like he’s twenty three, and doesn’t know any better.

                I don’t know the details, but I am certain he didn’t say “come rape me”. I agree that this stuff is unethical, but the article is a propaganda piece against internet speech, and I reserve judgement about claims of criminal
                behavior, as it is very easy to make someone look bad in a forum such as this.

                Thanks, I think you are a garbage person too! The fellow is being smeared by associating his unethical action with much worse actions (for example, “come rape me” is not something he did). I don’t know the details of this
                case, I just quickly made up my mind by reading this article, and noticing it is propaganda. I didn’t know anything about this case before, and I won’t bother learning.

                Weev is a reasoned but somewhat angry and irresponsible young fellow, who is being smeared here by unfair associations with much more vicious folks, in particular those who stalk and menace women. You must remember that his
                _sole_ offense is (arguably) placing already publically available information about the lady in question on a public forum, where it could be more easily read by others. This doxxing is certainly not ethical, but it is not
                quite criminal either, and it happens frequently towards much more powerless others who do not have the wherewithall to write a long rambling article in WiReD to complain about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here he is being compared with folks who purposefully induce seizures in epileptics, threaten to rape women, threaten to harm one’s children, and threaten murder! It is not right to make this comparison, he certainly didn’t
                do any of that. Doxxing isn’t stalking, it’s just a bad thing to do. It’s not even the worst legal thing he could do.
            </p>
            <p>
                In his blog posts, Weev has made it clear that he is not stalking the author of this article (why anyone would pay attention to her is not clear to me). I irrationally like him, simply because he defended internet pioneer,
                academic martyr, and free-software guru Richard Stallman from the permanent unfair attacks against him. He also made a cogent argument in support of a counterintuitive ethical proposition: he argues we should preserve the
                right to write and sell software exploits for profit. The ACLU, normally on the side of freedom, opposes this, because they are worried the exploits can be used for surveillance His argument is that, seemingly paradoxically,
                by allowing folks to sell exploits on an open market, the software exploits are found and fixed much more quickly, as the price is low enough for companies to buy the exploits themselves so as to fix them. In a regulated
                market, governments are the only customers who can afford to hire the dedicated staff to find the exploits, so the exploits are not fixed, and this actually reduces the cost of government surveillance, because there are more
                low-hanging fruit. His argument is cogent, and sincere, although I am not sure he is right in this case.
            </p>
            <p>
                He seems to be a normal sane person. His reckless nonsense, doing borderline criminal things, is probably just youth. He is obviously a valuable contributor to online discussions, possibly more so than the person bringing up
                the overblown and defaming charges against him, ridiculously associating him with rapists and murderers and those that incite murder.

                There is an important purpose to “online trolling”, when it is directed at ideas and does not threaten individual persons, as it serves as an effective immune system against incorrect or immoral ideas that propagate online.
                Without it, state agents, or deep pockets, can easily create a situation where criticism of blindly accepted material is heckled and silenced, even when the material is clearly nonsense and the criticism is cogent. Offensive
                language and over-the-top attacking is the way to overcome this barrier of authority.
            </p>
            <p>
                The over the top behavior crossed the line to personal harassment in the cases you cite, harassing you, and epileptics, etc. But in fighting such harassment, one must preserve freedom of speech, most especially speech which
                is not nice. While it is not ethically right to threaten people, it is a criminal offense, the rude behavior is not of the same character, as rude behavior is the most effective tool of the powerless to effect change.
                Harassment and stalking are crazy, and have no relation to this behavior. One must clearly and forcefully insist that you separate the two modes of behavior, as they are distinct, and online verbal battery is not at all
                intended as a personal threat or personal harrassment, but as a method of winnowing out ideas with powerful propaganda.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason is that the internet only works to produce truth when it is free to be as hostile as possible, only bounded by the limits of sanity. This has been clear since the early days of usenet. While there are a few people
                who use this freedom to prop up existing power structures, by dismissing the concerns of women or ethnic minorities, there is no exclusion of this tool to such folks, and their attacks are ineffectual, because ultimately
                they cannot go that far. The freedom of speech is most precious when it is used against those power structures, as it is the most effective form of anti-power anti-propaganda.
            </p>
            <p>
                For an example of a constructive troll, take a minute to read the feminist classic “The SCUM Manifesto”, which was written well before there was an internet (although in the early 1960s, the independent free press,
                consisting of self-published pamphlets and magazines served a similar purpose). This document can be read as a prototype for modern-day internet bashing, the rude, foulmouthed, offensive, hate-filled diatribes that threaten
                one’s sanity, but which serve to recast the world in an alien point of view. You need to protect the aliens, because sometimes the aliens get things right.
            </p>
            <p>
                Such propaganda techniques are important because they quickly and powerfully overwhelm the comparatively feeble propaganda techniques you find in old media, television, film, or traditional publishing (with the sole
                exception perhaps the exceedingly vicious and foul-mouthed race-baiting Nazi tracts). In old media, such crass language and over the top insults cannot get through the most rudimentary censors that block the way. The
                internet allows such language, and unfortunately such language is absolutely required in order to smash through bad or fraudulent science, to purge discussions of bigotry and xenophobia (using the same language the trolls
                you don’t like use), and to promote harmony and peace (despite the offense inherent to the language).
            </p>
            <p>
                This language can also be used unproductively, of course. But thankfully, the people telling the truth always have the advantage in a rude discussion. A quick correction such as what you wrote above, renders it harmless, and
                even counterproductive. In many cases where censored mass-media has been lying to the public, such language is needed now more than ever. So I would suggest to you to grin and bear it, and to learn to do it effectively
                yourself, because, while psychologically difficult, perhaps especially so for women, it is important. It is an essential online sacrament.

            <p>That’s right, you pus-oozing pap smear. I don’t make adult argument, I make the only effective argument for propaganda fed boobs like you, which is childish mindless repetition of hoary insults.</p>
            <p>
                You are too mentally incapacitated to read a scientific paper with any understanding, little lad, so there’s nothing else to do but beat the insults into your head until you realize that you are a worthless roach. You are a
                worthless rat-roach, you roach.
            </p>
            <p>
                This stuff works best on propagandized rat-roach people like you, because you are stupid enough to think that you are immune to this stuff. After some hammering by a bully like me, you start to wonder “why is my self-esteem
                eroding? Could it be from the endless spew of automatic insults from a stranger? No. It can’t be. I must have been wrong on this or that factual point. I’ll fix it. What’s the factual stuff I missed? I wonder…” Good, good.
                That’s when you start to revise your understanding of the facts.
            </p>
            <p>
                But it’s really not the facts getting under your skin, rat-roach, it’s the insults. You’re not immune to this stuff, this is the only way you can be persuaded, because you aren’t capable of mathematics and you can’t do
                science, which means you only have social methods to acquire knowledge, and those methods are manipulable by this propaganda method.
            </p>
            <p>
                Until now, the insults have mostly come from the establishment, so it was easy— you believed the establishment side. Now they are coming from a truther, so it’s hard. I mean, how can you guarantee that the insults will stop?
            </p>
            <p>
                I promise you, little buddy, when you join the truthers, the insults will stop. I promise. Then I will love you, and give you support. You’ll be my buddy! I’ll buy you beer. All you have to do is say it… come on… yeah….
                that’s it….

                “9/11 was…” (yes, go on little buddy, go on) “9/11 was an in…” (yes, yes, you got it, you know what to say!), “9/11 was an inside jjj…” (almost there) “job.” (good boy! Good boy. I’m proud of you.) That’s it. That’s all I
                wanted. Don’t you feel a lot better now that you’ve stopped being a ratty cockroach? Yes, I knew you would. Now you’re human again.

                what INSTRUMENTS detect.

            <p>
                So it doesn’t matter how you spin Jones, how he never showers and has muddy shoes. It doesn’t FUCKING MATTER, little idiot. You need to look at the INSTRUMENT READINGS IN HIS PAPER, retarded fool. Thermite is Iron Oxide and
                Aluminum POWDERS mixed together, STUPID FUCK, and the grain-size is important— they have to be fine powders mixed together uniformly. YOU INSINCERE PSEUDO-SCIENTIST. Jones found Iron Oxide and Aluminum powders mixed
                together, in a fine powder with a grain size of order 100 atoms.
            </p>
            <p>The thermite was used to disconnect the CORE STRUTS and COLUMNS from each other. They have to be disconnected, because physics will not let the building fall down when the core is intact.</p>
            <p>
                I really don’t give a FLYING FUCK whether Jones said this, or said that, or said the other thing. THE CORE HAD TO HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED FOR THE BUILDING TO FALL, and the quantity of molten steel and temperatures detected by
                thermal satellite imaging afterwards are consistent with a large chunk of the core having been melted using thermite incendiaries, JUST LIKE THE STUFF JONES FOUND.
            </p>
            <p>IT DOESN’T MATTER IF JONES MADE THE WHOLE THING UP! If he sat down and used PHOTOSHOP to draw his DETAILED MICROGRAPHS like PICASSO, and SKETCHED HIS SPECTROGRAPH RESULTS BY HAND BY PEN.</p>
            <p>
                IT DOESN’T MATTER, BECAUSE THAT CORE HAD TO GO AWAY FOR THE BUILDING TO FALL. In order for the building to fall down, rather than parts falling outward. The molten steel and high temperatures in an oxygen-free environment
                confirm that JONES with his photoshop and magic pen (and very steady hand) was just a damn-lucky guesser!

                Fire didn’t cause WTC collapse, because fire can’t remove the core. If you don’t remove the core, the building doesn’t fall down. A part can fall to the side. Another part can bend. The building can’t fall down in that
                middle part. Why? Because THERE’S A FUCKING CORE THERE, IDIOT. The thermite was there to removing the core.
            </p>
            <p>The exterior collapsed because there were also extra cutter charges on the outside.</p>
            <p>Wait, no… on the other hand… the core is gone… so… the exterior collapse did not use extra charges.</p>
            <p>No no, the witnesses say there were definitely extra charges.</p>

                Regarding “two theories”, you poor mentally challenged sod, the thermite was used to melt parts of the inner structure, to get rid of a large chunk of the core support, so that there was no central core anymore, all those
                tons of central steel were melted and disconnected at the joints. Without a central core, WTC I and II buildings would just collapse from the weakest point of the outer structure downward, more or less exactly as they did on
                that day. With an intact core, you illiterate baboon, the building would stay up indefinitely.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether there were additional cutter charges, I don’t know, and I DON’T FUCKING CARE. There was probably one in the basement to remove the foundation, because it killed people, and witnesses saw it, but WHO GIVES A SHIT,
                REALLY. You don’t need to go to such elaborate lengths to establish demolition, DEMOLITION IS OBVIOUS FROM THE COLLAPSE ITSELF.
            </p>
            <p>
                To see it was demolished, it is enough to know that the inner structural core strength fell to zero at the moment of onset of collapse. This is born out by NIST’s own model, as the only resistance to the falling in the
                model, the only difference from free-fall speed, is due the inertia of the building floors which start off stationary. This is consistent with a building with NO CORE ANYMORE, cutter charges or no cutter charges.

                Jones’s nano-thermite were not paint-chips, you scientifically illiterate chimpanzee, unless you buy your paint at “secret CIA chemicals R us”. The composition was FeOn/Al in fine-powder form, which is thermite. I admit that
                this is hard to determine, because you have to learn how to READ, and also how to DISMISS RETARDED ANTI-SCIENCE PROPAGANDA while you are reading. It’s hard for a person without opposable thumbs, I know, but try.

                The Delft fire had an ASYMMETRIC PARTIAL collapse of about 20-30% of the building, one face came down. The rest of the building was surrounded by concrete dust, you can view the photos of it after the collapse and before,
                and you can see IT LOOKED NOTHING LIKE THE WTC COLLAPSE!
            </p>
            <p>It was, as the truthers repeat, an asymmetric collapse around the columns that failed, and the crap that collapsed fell down to one side, after breaking off the building, leaving a whole bunch of building standing.</p>
            <p>
                I should point out that the WTC 1 and 2 demolition, the towers, was all done with thermite cutting the massive core, and is completely different from WTC 7 (classic demolition of a classical steel frame building) and WTC 6
                (plain old natural collapse, like Delft) both.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each collapse is a different phenomenon, but all the WTC 1,2,7 were unnantural, and WTC 6 and Delft are natural. The only one who would claim that Delft looks like WTC 7 (or WTC 1 2) is someone who is purposefully lying to
                make propaganda to cover up mass murder, and there’s a special place for you, with pitchforks and brimstone, motherfucker.

            <p>Listen, you lying fuckwit, I saw the collapse, I saw the pictures of the after-collapse, you can’t put me or anyone else on, we can look it up in two minutes. Give up your lying douchebaggery, it’s useless online.</p>
            <p>
                The building had one side collapse, as is normal from a fire weakened structure. It collapsed completely naturally, in a partial asymmetric collapse. If the WTC had collapsed this way, nobody would be complaining, dickwad.
            </p>
            <p>
                The WTC 1 and 2 complex buildings collapsed in a nearly symmetric fasion. The only delay from free-fall was due to the inertia of the floors. This means the gigantic central steel structure was melted and cut away during the
                hour before the collapse. We know it was cut away by thermite, because we have the chemical residues, and the melted steel and elevated temperatures on-site for the next weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The WTC 7 was just a straightforward demolition, it wasn’t even done like WTC 1 and 2, with removing the central part as in this case there was no central part. They buildings were obviously demolished, and arguing against
                this is mentally defective, and shows you don’t know the first thing about science. Retard.
            </p>
            <p>
                The demolition is secondary, because while it is true that the buildings were demolished, this can be concievably justified without an inside job, just from crazy public safety secret stuff. The drills of that day are what
                demonstrate that the whole attack was an inside job.
            </p>
            <p>It is impossible to argue against this, you can only dig yourself deeper and deeper into a hole, so give it up. You just are wrecking your credibility for no reason.</p>

                It probably wasn’t done by “the government”, it was done by the one fellow in charge of the miltary drills of that day, for his own delusional reasons. I’m pretty sure he didn’t ask for permission. What you don’t understand
                is how easy it is to pull off fake terrorism using drills. You don’t need evildoers to collaborate with you, you can do it essentially alone.
            </p>
            <p>The way to be sure of this is to review the drills of that day, and the way to prevent it happening again is to fobid such drills under penalty of attempted murder.</p>

            <p>
                It is very easy to know when an attack is an inside job. Find out if there were drills simulating the attack simultaneous with the attack. It’s not a hard question, and if the answer is yes, it’s an inside job, and there are
                no exceptions, nor can there be, statistically speaking.
            </p>
            <p>
                The drills are used to stage the attack by using drill participants, who think they are doing something harmless to prepare for terrorism, when in fact their drill preparation is being subverted by the coordinator in order
                to stage a fake attack. This is relatively easy to do, switch a fake bomb with a real one, switch remote planes with airliners, etc, it’s much easier than making a conspiracy of evil from inside a government. You don’t need
                anyone to be in on the secret, you can essentially pull it off alone as the coordinator.
            </p>
            <p>
                The existence of drills simulating the 7/7 attacks means it was done from the inside, end of story. Busted. Sorry, Britain, you don’t have it any better than the USA, unfortunately. It seems Spain and Norway don’t have it
                any better either. Best move to France.

            <p>Everett is making a technical</p>
            <p>
                point here, that it is technically inconsistent to use the Copenhagen interpretation with two separate observers, since the wavefunction reduction for one observer is not a-priori incompatible with that of the other
                observer. This is especially clear when one of the observers has access to the full wavefunction of the other observer, this is the Wigner’s-friend paradox (it could equally well or better be called Everett’s friend).
            </p>
            <p>One resolution to Everett’s friend is solipsism, that only YOU can collapse the wavefunction. This is the point he is making, and he is absolutely correct.</p>
            <p>
                The reason he “sounds wrong” to your untrained ears is because he is original. All original work sounds wrong, and it sounds wrong in direct proportion to the originality of the work, not in proportion to it’s correctness.
                One of the most important parts of scientific training is to learn to suppress the desire to brand all new ideas as wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everett also sounds wrong to trained scientist readers, for different reasons, having to do with philosophical prejudice, and the fundamental difficulty of getting a clear picture of such a strange idea as what he is
                proposing in his interpretation. That’s not his fault, that’s the reader’s fault.
            </p>
            <p>
                The statement you make, that he is “rejecting the fundamentally probabilistic nature of reality” is just making a propaganda point. His reality is fundamentally probabilistic, except the probability occurs in a different
                place, it is in the perception of classical data inside the observers, whose subjective perception are taking this or that path in the wavefunction, at random.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a complete dictionary between Everett concepts and Copenhagen concepts. There is no way to reject his interpretation as nonsensical or inconsistent (unlike, say, the transactional interpretation), because it is
                complete and with sufficient sophistication, equivalent to Copenhagen. But the different perspective gives insight into why Copenhagen is consistent, and why it looks the way it does.

            <p>
                The problems he is setting out in his thesis are those that happen when you consider simulating the Schrodinger equation that describes a person, and trying to extract the person’s experience inside the simulation from the
                numerical solution to the equation. A proper physical theory needs an algorithm to extract the perceptions of an observer from the data.
            </p>
            <p>Unlike Lubos Motl, you are not giving technical criticism based on philosophical disagreement, you are simply spouting ignorant propaganda, so I think it’s best if you shut the fuck up.</p>

                He gave a “physicist proof” on page 129, he showed that Gaussians are the only local minima of this inquality. After you try out a few examples, you see that this means it must be true. This is the usual
                variational-principle derivations that physicists sometimes call proofs in the case of other minima. It’s just not a rigorous proof, because the space of wavefunctions is not compact, so you need to worry about violations at
                the edges of the space, which are all possible distributions. There are clearly no violations, so he is justified in his conjecture, but proving this rigorously is a different kettle of fish than establishing it is true with
                scientific level of certainty. He did do that much, there could be no doubt it is true given the stuff on page 129.
            </p>
            <p>
                You call it “awkward” only because you aren’t familiar with it. What it says is that any additional bit of information gained about the probability distribution of p will, in the extreme case, be counterbalanced by a bit of
                information lost about x, no matter how it is gained. Once you get used to it, it starts to look like the correct fundamental way to state any uncertainty principle, and the variance argument starts to look hokey and
                derivative (Everett derives it on page 129, showing that his UP is strictly stronger).
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, the generalization to other commutators is not obvious for the information theoretic principle, while it is obvious for the variance. This is a sign that there is still future work to do, not that Everett
                was somehow doing something artificial.
            </p>
            <p>The information theoretic formalism he discusses is now standard, but it was relatively new in 1950s. He does a full lucid review from first principles in the thesis, and gives new results.</p>
            <p>
                Further, he then gives the method of embedding classical information into a quantum evolution, by identifying the classical information as a branch-selection. This is a proper way to state how quantum mechanics includes
                classical anything, the only classical thing here is information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everett does not use words like “many-worlds”, not because he is shy, but because he is stating things in a properly positivist way— he doesn’t want to use an inflammatory philosophical gauge. But he isn’t against using
                inflammatory philosophical language later, when he has nothing to lose, so he uses whatever language he feels like.
            </p>
            <p>
                The language is not important, the important thing is the mathematical content— he is identifying exactly how quantum mechanics plus embedded classical information selecting the wavefunction branch is equivalent to the
                Copenhagen interpretation of collapse. This is an extremely important result, it is the basis for all standard (meaning Copenhagen based, not hidden-variable) work on quantum mechanics since then.

            <p>You called Everett’s thesis devoid of content. I am showing you this is not so, as it contains an important result, the correct uncertainty principle.</p>
            <p>So you need to remove the slander on Everett’s talent, it’s as simple as that.</p>
            <p>
                Regarding the interpretation, the philosophy doesn’t add all that much, but the technical results, the method of separating states into relative states, is extremely important, as this is how you extract information about
                measurements when you are given access only to quantum mechanical wavefunction data.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am using slight ad-hominems, because in this case (and in only a handful of others) you have your head totally up your backside in a physics related matter. That is rare, since you usually are able to read the technical
                content very accurately.
            </p>
            <p>
                I suspect you simply have not bothered to read the technical content of Everett’s thesis, because the philosophical context made you vomit. Just cover your mouth, and consider it an intellectual exercize to see how he
                defines the relative states. I think you will come to like it.
            </p>
            <p>It doesn’t require you to accept any philosophy, the relative state formalism is independent of philosophy.</p>

                I am not wrong. I really don’t think you read past the end of section I, you skipped all the formal development. The most important results come at the end, not the beginning. The beginning is simply trying to align your
                philosophical view to understand the new perspective, and the new perspective is simply self-consistent. If you don’t see it is self-consistent, that’s your problem. Don’t impose it on the rest of thw world.
            </p>
            <p>
                You refuse to recognize the self-consistency, because you are hung up on one particular philosophy, the same one which happened to be shared by Bohr. That’s your hangup. You can’t make people choose philosophical stuff
                according to your taste.
            </p>
            <p>
                The philosophy you insist on is that the wavefunction is “informational data”, meaning it encodes what is known by an observer. What information exactly does it encode? The statement “it encodes the information about the
                result of various experiments through the Born rule” is not a-priori self-consistent, because it needs to make sense even when the observer is folded in to be part of the system. Pretty much no interpretation framework other
                than Born’s is consistent with this requirement.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you had not skipped the mathematical parts, you would not say that the fellow is talentless. The information theoretic uncertainty principle is itself a minor result, but it establishes the fellow’s talent all by itself.
                The information theoretic language regarding the quantum formalism is also important, because it gives a precise and different perspective on the classical/quantum divide in Bohr. The information itself is the only thing
                that is taken to be classical in Everett, not any physical objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everett pre-dates Wigner’s paper, and Wigner makes the statement that it is not the information which is classical, but “consciousness”. In this way, he separates out different kinds of information as distinguished, the
                information of a conscious observer. Wigner is ripping off Everett here, not the other way around, even though the basic idea was floating around for ages. The person who published it first, and analyzed it properly, is
                Everett. Wigner is just cannibalizing the theory after the originator was kicked out.
            </p>
            <p>The way to cleanse your mind for many-worlds is to imagine the following question: what does it mean to (classically) simulate an enormous quantum system, one containing an observer?</p>
            <p>Supposing you have an enormous classical computer, and you simulate the wavefunction values. What do you get out of the simulation?</p>
            <p>
                There is no obvious map in such a simulation between the data in your computer and the experience of the observer you are simulating, unlike in a classical simulation. If you wish to insist that this quantum system you are
                simulating contains a (simulated) AI, you need to give an algorithm to extract the thoughts of this AI and present them as classical information, to a readout terminal.
            </p>
            <p>This is the problem that Everett is solving. Given an enormous wavefunction simulation, he is telling you how to spit-out the internal data contained inside a more-or-less classical device that is being simulated.</p>
            <p>
                It’s not trivial, because the result of simulating such a quantum thing, assuming the initial wavefunction is concentrated appropriately in a relatively localized region, a mess of branching regions, a collection of places
                like a replicating Cantor-set on which there are significantly nonzero wavefunction values, and everywhere outside this Cantor set, the values are effectively zero.
            </p>
            <p>
                All that Everett did is to consider that there is no conflict between such an object (presented to you in gory detail on a classical computer) and the statement that this quantum simulation data is describing an observer
                which is seeing quantum mechanical outcomes, with probability. There is no conflict, because you can pick out “branches” which correspond to observer histories, and assign them consistent probabilities. The key result is the
                lack of interference in large systems, and the reason I say “it’s everywhere” is because he takes this no-macroscopic interference result for granted, he discusses it in th places I cited, but he doesn’t even feel the need
                to discuss it in depth, as it cannot be controversial.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is disturbing to me that you would fire away at Everett, considering that he has done nothing wrong, and certainly nothing dishonest. His work is meticulous, it is honest, and it is perfectly fine (within its own
                philosophical gauge). It is also one of the most influential physics papers of the 20th century.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you choose a philosophical gauge, put on yout philosophical glasses and insist on only looking at the world through these lenses, you are blinding yourself. It’s as sensible as a QED fellow who insists that Dirac found
                the one-true gauge, and anyone else who works with nonphysical photons is talking gibberish.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is incumbent upon you to separate out the philosophical issues you have from the technical issues. There are technical questions that Everett analyzes— how to define the state of an object relative to another, what it
                means to have a relative state, how it defines a relative collapse, how to deal with approximate measurements, and these issues are confusing in the usual philosophical gauge. The ability to switch philosophical gauge is
                simply necessary for a person who is commenting on academic matters. You have to differentiate between something you don’t like, which is consistent within itself, and something which is wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everett is not wrong, you just don’t like it, for the same reason as Bohr. It makes the philosophical contortions unnecessary, and it shows you that quantum mechanics has not answered unanswerable questions, merely
                reformulated the positions in different ways.

                Blah blah blah. Read the paper, it’s linked. Everett doesn’t use the words you didn’t like, and OBVIOUSLY non-interacting in this context means effectively non-interfering, and OBVIOUSLY it is only asymptotically valid in
                the classical limit.

                Having access to the thesis, the discussion of decoherence is in the fifth section, after the presentation of the interpretation. It begins with the Heisenberg-like analysis of the H-atom on page 86, and the discussion is
                particularly relevant toward page 99.
            </p>
            <p>The relevant discussion of the information theoretic Everett uncertainty principle is on page 129.</p>

                Decoherence is there from beginning to end, I can’t give you page number (I don’t remember, I read it more than 20 years ago) but the wording Everett uses is that the “branches become effectively
                non-interacting/separately-evolving once they are in the thermodynamic limit” or some such thing, and he justifies it rather simply, and this is what decoherence tries to make mathematically rigorous (for no good reason,
                because it is completely obvious).
            </p>
            <p>
                This non-interacting nature is what allows classical data (the classical data stored in computers, aka, plastic deformations of the environment, measuring devices, computers, and human brains) to get called a branch-label
                for a quantum state. The branch-labelling is what others would call a “decoherent history description”, or an “ein-selected state”. Everett called it a “branch”. Others call it a macroscopic superposition.
            </p>
            <p>
                You need to read the thesis. Really. It’s not that long, and it’s got real results. It also shows a tremendous talent, it’s one of the best theses in history. It also speaks well of Wheeler, to get two theses of this
                magnitude (one out of Feynman, one out of Everett, on obviously related topics).
            </p>
            <p>
                The concept of “decoherence” as stated and elaborated in the 1980s was ACKNOWLEDGED by the authors to be an extension of Everett’s work. People don’t acknowledge prior work for no reason. Gell-Mann has patiently explained
                this many times, it is a fact of literature dependence, the original source of Decoherence in Everett ’57.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is true that Gell-Mann rederived Everett’s ideas for himself in 1960 or so, so what. Everett is the original. Gell-Mann’s “consistent histories” is a variation on Everett, as he says both in citations and in person, in
                recorded interviews.

                Wigner’s published his “Wigner’s friend” in 1962. The trick with “Wigner’s friend” is HAVING THE BALLS TO PUBLISH, of course people were thinking about this in 1935. What makes it publishable is that it creates a contrast
                with many-worlds— the observer’s information is treated as “conscious” and different from a computer’s information. Everett treats all classical information the same, whether inside a computer or inside a human.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wigner didn’t want to upset the Bohr, and saw an opportunity in 1962 to publish some old ideas that would never get into print. Everett was willing to upset the Bohr, and so got sacrificed in Denmark. Everett was the first
                to publish clearly the ideas involved.
            </p>
            <p>He was also the first to state and argue the information theoretic uncertainty principle (it’s in his thesis, and it’s a great result):</p>
            <p>I(x) + I(p) &gt; C</p>
            <p>
                Where C is e\pi or something like this, it’s what the inequality evaluates to on Gaussians. Everett showed that Gaussians are local minima of this inequality, and that there are no other local minima, strongly suggesting it
                is an exact inequality (it’s hard to prove, it wasn’t proved until 1975, by Beckner).
            </p>
            <p>where I(x) is the information in the x-distribution of psi-squared, and I(p) is the information in the p distribution of psi-squared. This is the first “correct” statement of the uncertainty principle.</p>

            <p>The naturalness arguments easily support a conspiracy in the cases of 9/11 and JFK.</p>
            <p>
                Lee Harvey Oswald was certainly NOT a communist, he was a right-winger paid to pose as a communist, as many associates have testified, and as his contacts make obvious. He learned Russian in the Marines, he defected to the
                USSR in 1959 or something, straight out of the Marines, and returned to the US with no questions asked in 1961, after having renounced his US citizenship. This fits the profile of a CIA guy, since pretty much every single
                defector from the US to the USSR in this era was an intelligence agent. I urge you to find another sincere defector of this kind. But the CIA program of sending agents to the USSR as defectors in the late 50s and early 60s
                is out in the open now.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oswald’s “support Cuba” campaign was an obvious front, his organization had no members, and he met with a known CIA fellow. The shooting itself was not possible using Oswald’s rifle from Oswald’s position in the time it
                took, and the video evidence is not supportive of the official story to say the least. The undoctored reports of the autopsy are also not supportive of the official story.
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, it is very easy to see how a conspiracy could be covered up here:</p>
            <p>Johnson (to Warren commission): It seems that Oswald was a part of a conspiracy involving Cuba and the USSR. Do you folks want to reveal this and risk WWIII?</p>
            <p>Warren: Heck no.</p>
            <p>Johnson: Well then, Oswald acted alone, that’s your conclusion.</p>
            <p>
                This cover-up is pretty transparent, and rather lame, and the American public saw through it within a decade. If you listen to authoritative pronouncements on this from media, you will get it wrong. The conspiracy in this
                case was pretty large, as conspiracies go. It involved at least a dozen people, and more who had a clue about it. The reason Americans got to know this is through percolation of knowledge, some media events, and a 1978
                Congressional reinvestigation that concluded that JFK was assassinated in a conspiracy. It is dead certain that he was, the official story is mentally retarded.
            </p>
            <p>
                To know more, there is a wonderful recent discovery, from an unexpected place. Two top CIA folks were identified in Robert Kennedy’s assasination! These folks had no reason to be there at all, in that hotel. The naturalness
                argument there is quite impressive.
            </p>
            <p>
                The RFK assassination is another conspiracy blamed on a lone gunman. Sirhan doesn’t remember the shooting, and claims he was an RFK supporter. His shots were wild, and it is likely that none of his bullets hit RFK. The CIA
                was involved in hypnosis projects at the time, and his behavior is consistent with a hypnotized assassin (this is not science fiction). Dollars to donuts these two guys also were involved with JFK’s assassination, an Martin
                Luther King’s.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the case of 9/11, the naturalness arguments are even easier. It is acknowledged by the US government that there were drills simulating multiple hijackings at the exact same time as the “actual” attack. What is the
                naturalness bound on any theory that maintains the simulation and the attack were independent events? The naturalness bound only becomes tighter as you understand that the attack would not have succeeded without the drills
                of that day, as the airliners would have been intercepted by fighters, followed all the way to New York, and shot down if they tried to crash into anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the drills can be used to fake the attack in certain obvious ways, without requiring a conspiracy at all, just well meaning dupes doing their jobs, knowing about the drills is like seeing the wires used to levitate the
                magician. The magician will say “no, no, I am really levitating, the wires are for safety.” But the same naturalness arguments is what makes the claim absurd to the ear.

                The main problem here is you have the personal trauma of living under communism. Communism was an evil system, sure, but it was opposing another evil system, gigantic corporate capitalism and secret intelligence agency
                government. The two systems were evil in totally different ways, and if you are trained to identify communist evils, you generally can’t see the capitalist evils, because they weren’t there under communism.
            </p>
            <p>
                The evils of communism were the squelching of individual initiative, the complete stifling of innovation, the terrible bureaucracy, and the government repression. Those things are a-ok in the US, the bureaucracy is not that
                bad, and things generally work. The evils in capitalist countries (after industrialization monopolizes capital) are gigantic accumulations of private power, through monopoly and finance, which ultimately produce an
                aristocracy of wealthy folks with class priviledge, and these monstrous aristocrats engineer these monstrous events, and cover them up with their friends, who own everything, including the media.
            </p>
            <p>
                Folks who lived under communism can’t imagine the degree of conspiracy and collusion of private and government forces inside a capitalist society, because their society was so communal, so that no individual had that much
                power, not even in the politburo, and you could never engineer cover-ups of this sort.

                The observer in Many-worlds is modelled as a comptuer, and the relevant “ein-selected states” are defined by referencing the internal memory state of the computer. This is simply an “external” view of the Copenhagen
                interpretation, modelling the observer as classical data superimposed upon a purely quantum evolution, and the same things that happen in Copenhangen interpretation happen in many-worlds, with the exact same dependence on
                the “subjective classical data” as you put it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The equivalence of many-worlds to Copenhagen is not obvious unless you read Everett in the original. He is simply redoing Copenhagen without the idea that the classical realm is separate and irreducible, only using the
                positivist idea that the information in the computers is irreducible (because it defines the sensations of the observers).
            </p>
            <p>
                The result is a recasting of Copenhagen which removes the metaphysical quandaries, and stops you from constant head-banging about what the heck Bohr and co are talking about. They are talking about many-worlds, more or less,
                with less sophistication, less awareness of the precise mechanism of decoherence, and more philosophical jibber-jabber.

                You can pretty straightforwardly explain certain Nobel-prize discoveries to a layman: The integer quantum Hall effect requires only a little background— the effect is straightforward, and it’s significance is obvious.
                Likewise high-Tc superconductivity, CP violation (or more recently, T violation), or looking back much further, X-rays, radioactivity, and the neutron are immediately understandable by anyone with no preparation. These are
                experimental discoveries, however, and Feynman was talking about theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even in theory, there are certain discoveries which are very simple to explain to laypeople precisely. Quarks, for instance, are very simple to understand, and the signficance is immediate. Nambu’s pion-condensate is also
                immediately accessible. Another example (although it did not win a Nobel prize, likely because it is experimentally incorrect in detail) is Kolmogorov scaling theory of turbulence. Fractals are popular, and they are
                essentially modern block-renormalization in visual image, and this was a Nobel in the 1980s for Wilson.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are other discoveries that are more abstract, but the main barrier is simply that the public does not understand Quantum Mechanics. So it would be hopeless for Feynman to explain the path-integral, the diagrams, or the
                relavistic regulator, loop counting, and renormalization methods. For this, a rigid philosophical point of view is a distraction, and there is no harm in leaving the philosophy free-floating.

                Lubos, you should read Everett’s thesis before commenting on the man’s talent. It contains a deep information theoretic analysis of quantum mechanics, the first statement of the information theoretic uncertainty principle,
                in addition to the first statement of the principle of decoherence.
            </p>
            <p>
                The essence of Many-Worlds is what is now called “decoherence”, that quantum mechanics, for large systems, is decohered, and reduces to independently evolving paths which, while you can’t say they are exclusive, might as
                well be. That’s the only point, it’s a point that has become too well accepted for you to see the original source.
            </p>
            <p>
                The original source is Everett, and you are maligning a classic physicist with an influential classic paper, and an influential thesis. You should read the paper and the thesis before criticizing, because if you only read
                secondary sources, you won’t get it.

            <p>There is only one person that needs to know what’s happening— that’s the person in charge of the drills of that day. The way you stage it is by setting up drills for each of the individual parts of the attack.</p>
            <p>
                1. Put remote control 767s in the sky<br />
                2. Fake/altered computer radar blips on air-traffic control screens
            </p>
            <p>
                3. flight simulation of crashing planes into buildings<br />
                4. fake hijacking of airliners
            </p>
            <p>
                Then on the day of the attack, you use drill 2 to switch the coordinates of the airliners from drill 4, and the drones from drill 1, and use drill 3 to professionally pilot the drones into the buildings. Nobody involved has
                any clue that they are doing an attack, they just think that a real attack happened to coincide with a set of drills that suspiciously resemble the attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is exactly what happened on 9/11. An attack coincided in time, place, and type with a series of drills that resemble the attack. Since this is a-priori statistically impossible, you can be sure that this is how the
                attack was carried out, and you don’t need further evidence. Nevertheless a lot of further evidence is available if you look for it.

                I know this for a fact because the physics is objective, and kind of obvious to anyone who understands anything about this stuff. It is not important to produce witnesses for the setting of explosives, because the buildings
                themselves are the witnesses. The team itself was probably small, maybe 5-10 people, the “secrecy” just consisted of using foreigners and telling them to keep it quiet, and telling commission members that they are not to
                investigate explosives, for national security reasons, and then booting out anyone who disagreed. Who the heck cares. The demolition is secondary.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main thing about 9/11 is that it was happening with a simultaneous set of drills. Those drills involved live-fly airplanes, simulations of planes crashing into buildings, and air-traffic readiness exercise involving all
                sorts of computer-generated fake airplanes. That stuff is the main reason one can be certain that it was an inside job.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason is not obvious, because it requires you to understand something crucial: when you are staging an attack like this NOBODY CAN KNOW. Everyone has to be clueless regarding the plan, they just have to think they are
                doing their job.
            </p>
            <p>So how the heck can you pull it off? There is essentially only one way.</p>
            <p>You need planes to go into buildings, and no pilot is going to commit suicide, so you need remote control 767s. That’s drill one.</p>
            <p>1. Put remote control planes in the sky</p>
            <p>But no well trained military pilot would even think about deliberately crashing a remote-control plane into the WTC either. So you need to tell them that it’s just a simulation on a computer. That’s drill two.</p>
            <p>2. Computer simulate crashing planes into WTC and Pentagon.</p>
            <p>
                Next, you need to justify where these planes originated. So you need to confuse the air-traffic control into thinking that the drones you are using are a continuation of the planes that are hijacked. So that’s drill three.
            </p>
            <p>3. Screw with the air-traffic computer systems.</p>
            <p>But you also need to produce a hijacking, and that’s drill four.</p>
            <p>4. Fake hijacking using CIA agent fake hijackers.</p>
            <p>
                Then on the day of the attack, you start the hijacking. Four people are sitting in the back, one stands up and says “I have a bomb”. One is sitting in the cockpit and asks the pilots to turn off the transponders and land at
                the nearest military base.
            </p>
            <p>After the transponders are turned off, you switch the coordinates of the drones from drill one and the airliners from drill four using drill three.</p>
            <p>Next you have the pilots from drill two unwittingly pilot the drons (now identified as the airliners) into their targets.</p>
            <p>
                At the beginning, nobody knows about your plan. Even at the end, nobody knows what happened, only the three pilots in drill two can figure it out. They aren’t involved with the rest of thre drills, all the drills are secret,
                and nobody has anything more than a funny feeling “Hey, weren’t we simulating something similar to this just as it was happening? Weird.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You set off the demolition (it’s prearranged, and not hard to cover up), you herd the passengers onto flight 93 (in terms of the actual plane, after all the switcheroos, it’s actually flight 11), and you shoot down flight 93
                in midair, and cover that up (again, an easy cover-up, considering the potential liability). That’s it. 9/11.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only way to pull off an inside job without anyone knowing is to use these drills. This way, nobody can reveal anything, except that there were a bunch of suspicious drills at the same time as 9/11. You shred the
                documents for the drills 6 months later, and you’re off scott free.
            </p>
            <p>
                But guess what? People DID speak out about the drills. They leaked early, in 2002. I found out about the radar-blip drill in 2002, the live-fly drill leaked at around the same time (although what kind of planes were used in
                this drill was still classified and probably already shredded by now), and the simulation of flying planes into buildings ALSO leaked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given the complete asininity of the idea that the exact drills you would use to stage 9/11 just happened to coincide with the real 9/11, you can conclude that the drills were used to stage the attack with no further
                evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                You expect no witnesses to anything except the drills, and the various modifications to those drills. Each drill, and each modification, in isolation, looks harmless. It’s only when you put them together that you get a false
                flag.
            </p>
            <p>
                I should point out that one person was in charge of all the drills of the day, and of the US military response on that morning. It seems likely to me that even George W. Bush wasn’t sure what was going on that day. It is
                possible that only one person in the administration was responsible, although it could have been a handful more, of course, it’s not necessary.
            </p>
            <p>The same method is used to stage false flags still, it is the only real way to do it. So now you know how to end terrorism— simply forbid terrorism drills.</p>
            <p>
                Now that you know what happened, you can also understand why the attack is crappy, why so many things didn’t look right. The person planning this can’t make everything go ok, all this person has are drills. So the airplanes
                that hit the buildings don’t look like commercial airliners, they look like military remote controlled planes. This is confirmed by eyewitness testimony, and also by looking at the bottom of the plane that struck the second
                tower. You can easily see with your own eyes that there is an outjutting at the bottom, and you can find remote-control military equipment that is in the shape of that outjutting. There is no such outjutting on a commercial
                767, and it is hard to deny evidence of your own eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also track the switcheroo on Pilots for 9/11 truth, who show flight 175 getting real close and appearing to swap with an “unidentified military plane” from one of the exercizes of that day, the exercize I identified
                as “drill one”.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can find the murray st. engine, which is consistent with a military plane, you can find eyewitness accounts to corroborate ALL of the drills required (and more), and given that this story I told you is NOT EVEN DESCRIBED
                BY MOST TRUTHERS, you can see that they would have no motivation to plant this stuff, because, without the complete story of how the attack was pulled off, who the heck cares about all those drills?

                The movie owes a debt to two stories probably recycled through the comic. The obvious one is Ursula LeGuin’s “Omelas”, but this is just a generally parallel allegory. The clear setting inspiration for this is a story about a
                closed-ecosystem train running through a post-apocalyptic landscape that I read two decades ago in an anthology of 70s or 80s science fiction. The scenario in the train story is exactly parallel to the train in this story,
                except the world outside is ravaged by nuclear war, and there are some people outside, starving to death, The folks on the train are all wealthy, it focuses on a young boy who does not accept his own good fortune, to be
                among the lucky ones on the train. I wish I could remember the author or title, but after lots of searching, I’m still blanking on it.

                The demolition itself doesn’t require a conspiracy, because it can be justified as required for public safety. The 1993 bombing was designed to topple the towers onto lower Manhattan, and it makes sense to place a demolition
                system, just in case there’s another attack. The number of people involved is very small, and it wasn’t done in such secrecy, the explosives were placed there at some point, it’s not like anyone would notice, nor that the
                people placing it were malicious. It just sat there for a long time, until the buildings were imploded. It was not a big deal.
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing to argue about, because the demolition is obvious from the laws of physics, and physics trumps all other knowledge.</p>

                Considering his time constraints, Oliver Stone is accurate in his history, and refreshingly so. On the other hand, you are saying mentally defective things. Doing this kind of propaganda online is like trying to blot out the
                sun with a magic marker. It is best to be honest about the past.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding “Birth of a Nation”, in the 1920s, the Democrats were the party of Southern racism, so there is no contradiction. Democrats doesn’t mean left, not before FDR, and not really after FDR. Stone would say Kennedy
                qualifies, but only from 1963 on, and there isn’t much to judge, so it’s not clear.
            </p>
            <p>“youtube territory” is a silly insult, youtube is freer than television and therefore collectively more accurate. You would be better off insulting a youtube video as being in television territory.</p>
            <p>
                The conspiracies you imagine in Stone’s documentary are not small-room conspiracies, they are structural Marxism. Structural Marxism just means that you are supposed to look at the decisions of a political entity like the US
                as produced from a weighted average of the self-interest of the members with the most capital. The political orders are subservient to the wealthiest class. This minority decides what foreign policy direction to take, and it
                is based on class groupthink. The media then sells this politics to the public. That’s not a conspiracy, because the rich folks genuinely believe their own shit, they don’t have enough common experience to see when they are
                wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                That doesn’t mean that they are always wrong, they are sometimes right, it just means that there is a structural bias there, and the structural bias makes for automatic propaganda against any socialist or Marxist movement,
                or any type of nationalization. One must compensate for this structural bias in order to get a sense of accurate history, and Stone compensates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from FDR, Oliver Stone would say Kennedy too, US administrations worked primarily to maintain the ability of capital to manage oversees resources for profit. This means that any regime that attempted to expropriate
                property was an enemy, and any regime that invited Western investment was a friend. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it just is what it is, this is what happened. Many right-wing fascist leaders were supported over more
                popular socialist leaders. Many left-wing movements were undermined, brutal ones like the Khmer Rouge, and more benign ones like the Sandanistas.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was supposed to counter Soviet supported aggression, meaning various socialist and communist movements all over the world. But the Soviets were just not very good at supporting these movements covertly, nowhere near as
                good as the Americans suspected. The socialist movements were nearly always home-grown. Even if you think they were mistaken, you need to recognize their independence. This is especially clear today, the Soviet Union is long
                gone, but socialists in South America win elections.
            </p>
            <p>
                What the USSR often did is to support the movements with jawboning, and then try to take over by manipulating their leadership with promises of oil and financial support, until they had a friendly government. This didn’t
                work as well as CIA covert operations, which could work through a network of local businessmen, who always have more power than local guerillas in the mountains.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding star wars, the idea of missile defense protecting the US from a full-scale nuclear attack was a addle-brained fantasy, but at least it was an original idea. Physicists in the US, from Hans Bethe on down,
                unanimously said it could not work, and they were right. In “unanimously”, I am excluding Edward Teller, who was trying to get research money for an H-bomb powered X-ray laser, and excluding also the recepients of missile
                defense grants. This politicization of science was deplorable, and became worse under Bush II. A missile defense, as many people pointed out, even if it could be deployed, would be much more cheaply fooled with decoy
                missiles. It would never never be able to hit 10,000 missiles, not even at a .01% success rate. Intercepting one missile, or a few, on the other hand, is marginally possible, although difficult. This is what iron dome does.
                To conflate the two types of defenses is imbecilic. Stone is right about star wars.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Soviets didn’t oppose star-wars because they were afraid of not being able to thwart the defense, they were afraid of an arms race in space, which they didn’t want and couldn’t afford. They also suspected that the point
                of the thing was to make a nuclear first-strike seem safer, regardless of the reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                The USSR in the later parts of the cold war was much more benign than the US, partly because it was weaker, but partly because it indirectly was on the side of indigenous rights movements. The US supported the worst regimes
                in the world to stop communism from spreading. The historical memory is preserved by Oliver Stone, and since he is not making advocacy for the future, I think it is best if you sucked it up and accepted it, because with
                time, history will get it right.

                Do your offers never expire? Ok, sure, I’ll do it (please be patient, I am flaky). Unfortuately, I now know that my personal theory while theoretically not crazy, is incompatible with the experimental data. Peter Hagelstein
                showed this convincingly early on, you can’t have the He4 born as fast charged particles in excess heat events, it produces secondary neutron production at levels at least a hundred and more likely a thousand times larger
                than what is observed. I have only ideas for fixing this, but they are shaky, and I am now confused to a large extent. I was sure it was right, because it wasn’t crazy, but the experimental data is really crazy.

                Regarding P!=NP, I thought I could prove it from this heuristic ten years ago, I thought about it a lot during some weeks, and it is not impossible that there is a not-too-difficult proof somewhere, but I never found it. It
                is not easy to make precise the notion of entropy of garbage bits in reversible computation. But as an intuition, it is heuristically convincing, because the complexity of the forward algorithm keeps going up without bound,
                while the complexity of the putative inverse algorithm is fixed at whatever it is, so the inverse algorithm really should crap out at some point, when the complexity in the garbage is greater than the program can provide
                structure to. I assumed everyone else had this intuition, until I saw the ridiculously weak arguments Scott Aaronson gave (and others).
            </p>
            <p>
                There is one linked article where I saw a vague comment by John Conway saying P!=NP should be a consequence of “Berry’s paradox” (computational complexity) reinterpreted in the complexity class setting, this is roughly the
                same intuition. But I didn’t realize people didn’t even have a heuristic argument for it.

                The relation between the two fields of Ulam’s interest, set theoretic mathematics, and Monte-Carlo, is rather direct. In set theory, the monte-carlo method is incompatible with the structure of the continuum as it is
                normally presented, there are so-called “non-measurable sets”, which make it impossible to consistently speak about a randomly chosen arbitrarily chosen real number, so Monte Carlo is hard to talk about, you need a
                sigma-algebra and a measure extending the naive Borel measure, and this is Lebesgue measure. It looks like it is universal, but constructions with the axiom of choice prevent it from being universal. This is a serious
                intuition problem, you run into problems when you make probabilistic arguments, because you are implicitly assuming that all sets are measurable when you make naive probabilistic arguments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ulam’s measurable cardinals are a very strong extension to set theory which attempt to figure out what it would mean to have a set so infinite that you could define a translationally invariant measure on it, like Lebesgue
                measure. But he did some fiddling around with the concept, so that it is not the naive statement “every set is measurable”, but something else compatible with the axiom of choice, but only at the cost of introducing
                enormously large sets into the universe, much larger than previous large cardinal axioms. The intuition that this should be possible is likely from the intuitive probability thing (although honestly, I don’t understand the
                intuition well, these cardinals are too big for my limited mind today, I can only grasp little large-cardinals, like Inaccessibles or Mahlo cardinals, which are just cleverly iterated inaccessibles).
            </p>
            <p>
                The concept of “meager set” and so on is also likely inspired by ideas from measure, the relationship is made clear only later, during Cohen’s forcing revolution of 1963-1965. The upshot of this (for a physicist) came in
                1972, when Solovay finally published his 1960s model of set theory where every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable. This is something important, it is a system of mathematics which dovetails with the implicit assumptions of
                physicists, who assume that any probabilistic construction, like “consider a random thermally equilibrated configuration of an Ising model”, automatically makes sense, so that you can ask questions about set-membership of
                this configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a Solovay style mathematical universe, you can say “pick a random real number” and the idea makes sense, so you can understand the notion of “measure” and “volume” from Monte-Carlo considerations. This is in some sense a
                vindication of this earlier intuition, which was probably shared by Ulam and Erdos. Erdos also worked on set theory issues and measurable cardinals at around the same time, and proposed his “probabilistic method” in
                combinatorics as an example of “naive” (meaning assuming everything is measurable) probabilistic reasoning becoming useful in spaces as large as the continuum.

                The argument for P!=NP is simply that reversing a general computation “should” require exponential search, because irreversible computation can be rewritten as a reversible compuatation, where you are producing random junk
                bits as you go along. If you have a computation of N steps starting with initial computer memory state I and producing final state F, you can embed it in a reversible computation starting from initial state (I,0) with the
                initial state expanded to include order N garbage bits set to 0, and end up in final state (F,G) where the final state of the garbage bits is G. Now you can reverse it trivially. But to reverse it without knowing the garbage
                bit values, you need to reconstruct the garbage bits from F.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point of P!=NP is that to construct the garbage bits for an arbitrary computation are not structured, so to go from F to (F,G) requires an exponential search through a sizable fraction of all 2^N possibilities for G,
                even if you know the algorithm and you know N. It is completely reasonable, it should require an exponential search, because whatever structure is present on G is going to be more complex than any fixed algorithm, because
                the structure of G grows in complexity with the forward algorithm complexity and with time (or equivalently, with the initial state F and with time). This is not anything like a proof, because the space of G’s are structured
                by the fact that they are generated via computation, but it should be possible to prove that any algorithm for computing G from F quicker than exponentially can be spited appropriately, by choosing the proper algorithm which
                would produce garbage bits which the backward algorithm would mispredict.

                This argument is not dependent on any nonsense about “if it was possible, it would already be done”, or “the consequences would be appaling” or anything like that. It is a heuristic reason to believe the conjecture, and you
                should (after understanding the argument) just believe that the conjecture is true. The social nonsense is propped up because the intuitions about why it should be true are hard to make precise, and will not be persuasive
                until the proof is available.

                Pauli was about the non-supernatural version of synchronicity, the kind where you discover something and find out that someone else discovered the same thing too. It’s something scientists are familiar with, and it is not
                bullshit. If you’ve never seen simultaneous discovery, you haven’t done any correct original thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem is that Jung was not a careful thinker and mixed up this legitimate phenomenon with others that are bullshit. Pauli criticized the bullshit aspects, but promoted the verifiable and true aspects, because he was
                able to cut through bullshit persuasively.

                This is nonsense you made up. There is no sub-stylistic difference in Bible reference, and they are manifestly the same author for even the most casual reader. As for keeping him alive in Italy, the research in “Shakesepare
                Guide to Italy” demonstrates the familiarity with the country. The fact that he is alive and writing the plays is demonstrated by the plays existence, and the stylometric match, which is just plain impossible.

                Rudeness is extremely important in public discourse, as it cuts through political bullshit, and allows mistakes to be called out forthrightly. There is no alternative. For this reason, rudeness is an institution in physics
                discourse, it was enshrined by Pauli, you are supposed to insult wrong things bluntly, hostilely, and repeatedly, in strong language. If you are wrong, you then go on to bluntly say so, and hostilely and repeatedly insult
                yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                The internet is bringing scientific honesty to other types of discourse through the magic of rudeness. Politness is a political construct, which allows political hierarchies to keep people in line. It’s gone, and good
                riddance.

                This is indeed a difference in Marlowe and Shakespeare, but it is reasonably explained by maturity. If you believe this— make a sentence length stylometry, plot it for Shakespeare and Marlowe, and show the sentence length is
                constant in the two authors, and has a discontinuity at 1593. This would be good evidence for your position. But having seen the ridiculous coincidence in the other stylometries, I would bet that you wouldn’t find an actual
                discontinuity, but a smooth transition. This might be “run on lines” you are talking about, and Peter Farey had a plot of run on lines plus feminine endings, which showed a smooth transition between Marlowe and Shakespeare
            </p>
            <p>
                The Jew of Malta is a bit obscene at the end, and that stuff, plus Faustus, is a good reason for a chastised humble Marlowe to change his style, he was ashamed of his youthful bombast. But whatever, if you can find a
                quantitiative difference (sentence length is fine, but I doubt it will be really different), then you have evidence. Until you do, you have no evidence, and the balance of the evidence goes Peter Farey’s way.

            <p>Hi Peter—</p>
            <p>
                I am more certain than you by now, I am relatively close to 5 sigma sure, because I not only looked over your stylometries (which gave me good confidence, about 3 sigma) but also additional ones— the ones published to refute
                Marlovian ideas by Charniak et al last year.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result of the new stylometries not only failed to refute the Marlovian idea, they confused Marlowe and Shakespeare more completely than Mendenhall, and this is after these guys tried hard to look for a stylometry
                specifically to distinguish these two. This is the last straw, that pushes me to five sigma.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you have independent stylometries, each one could independently fail. Your stylometries each had a 1 in 4 chance of being a coincidence, but you had 5 of them, and some of them were published specifically to distinguish
                Marlowe and Shakespeare. This means that one gains 1/4^5 confidence from this, about 1/1000 chance of coincidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                The newest stylometries confused four separate Marlowe plays as early Shakespeare, by two separate methods! These methods were much more rigorous— they involved careful statistical analysis of vocabulary and function words
                in baskets compared across works, and this gives another 1/1000 likelihood. So I’m sure, there’s no more evidence necessary, you guys are right, and there’s no need to be so circumspect.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, if you want more certainty, each independent stylometry is additional independent evidence— so I would run your “letter stylometry” on 100 different letter-baskets, and see if you get a smooth match
                Marlowe-Shakespeare in all 100 cases (you certainly will, since they are the same author). Even if each coincidence is 50% likely (it much less likely than that), 1/2^100 is scientific certainty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stylometry of this quality is enough to say “enough, they’re the same guy” with scientific standards of certainty, especially considering the fact that you have shown that the circumstantial evidence is equally friendly to
                this notion as to any other.
            </p>
            <p>Plus, stop being so nice to the academics. They aren’t returning the favor. You’re right and they’re stupid.</p>

        <div>
            <p>
                All patterns match, including metrical and grammatical ones. The enjambments plus feminine endings curve for Shakespeare matches Marlowe, so does function word stylometry, which is sensitive to length of clauses. Whatever
                metric you use, Marlowe is mathematically indistinguishable from Shakespeare, and this is an unacceptable coincidence for stylometry, it is obviously a sign of common authorship, and considering the number of stylometries,
                it is mathematically illiterate, and just plain stupid, to deny it.
            </p>
            <p>Sorry Shakespearian scholars, your goose is cooked. You’ve been exposed, you are frauds and nincompoops. It’s nice that the Copernican revolution of English literature has finally arrived.</p>

                The Turing lecture presents a very important idea: that it is impossible to build a convincing sophisticated computational circuit using point mutations in any reasonable time scale. This point was made intuitively by Pauli
                in the 1950s, when it was a response to modern synthesis evolution. It has been made by nonscientists as well, who find it hard to buy the idea of evolution happening by random point mutation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea that there is a learning mechanism for modifying the genome is obviously true, and it is fantastic that someone with some clout has finally taken this position. But the learning hypothesis is not very persuasive
                because it is missing the main point. The memory capacity of the proteins is just too small to account for the computational complexity of the DNA rewriting, the number of protein combinations is generally vastly smaller
                than the number of DNA combinations. This paradox was very clear to those who studied protein networks, it makes it difficult to imagine any model of evolution which operates on DNA using proteins alone. To modify gigabytes
                of functional data, You need a molecule which can encode gigabytes of random-access data in a read/write way, in a dense encoding. The only real candidate, excluding DNA methylation and DNA conformation (which are recently
                emphasized hacks with similar function) is RNA.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lack of direct communication or compatibility between the protein and DNA level information demands that the information about future mutations must be stored in self-modifying computing strands of RNA. This is a firm
                prediction, it must be so, and yet it is not accepted fully within biology.
            </p>
            <p>
                This prediction allows one to predict that the DNA in the cell is mostly noncoding, since the coding region is controlled and evolved by the noncoding parts. It requires that the noncoding part is transcribed into RNA
                despite being noncoding. This is also now known to be true. It provides the only convincing role for the massive amount of long noncoding RNA in the nucleus. This RNA is computing, making a nervous system for the cell, and
                this computation provides the only plausible mechanism for machine-learning in the genome.
            </p>
            <p>
                The computation in RNA requires that the RNA can distinguish different strands from one another, and this is done through complementary binding, and splicing/resplicing events in RNA. The hypothesis is that these events are
                making closed-loop computation with each other, without any need for translation to proteins, using only proteins available in the nucleus.
            </p>
            <p>
                The RNA/RNA events and RNA reverse transcription (which is required for the evolution to be influenced by the RNA) are the “strange events” which are described in the video, but they are not all that random, they are
                constrained by the allowed mutagenesis in the RNA computing system in the nucleus.
            </p>
            <p>
                The communication between RNA and DNA predicts that there are reverse transcriptase genes in the genome (this is also true, in ERVs), and that these are transcribed and active in certain cases. This has been observed in
                human tissue in cancer cells, where full functional HERVs are produced, including the polymerase, which allows for reverse transcription. The reverse transcription functionality of the human genome is important, since it
                allows you to couple the RNA computation back into the DNA.
            </p>
            <p>The contains complementary matching motifs which allow self binding (true and surprising) and that that it is composed of interpretable domains with features which are not random.</p>
            <p>The “evolvability” condition then presented here is much too strict, the evolution can include rewriting of the code which is sensible, directed by the RNA networks in an egg.</p>
            <p>
                This completely resolves the paradox of evolution presented in the video, but it introduces vastly more computation into the cell than is known at present. It demands that the RNA computation is sufficiently complex to
                essentially have a model of the protein production and the noncoding RNA production in the cell, so that it can sensibly modify the DNA for future generations.
            </p>
            <p>These predictions are biologically surprising, and they are the only plausible way to allow for evolution to produce observed biological complexity, yet are not accepted fully,</p>

                The word “civility” on internet forums means something different than what you think. It is simply a trick of moderators. The “incivility” is not presented with examples of you cussing at people (which no one ever does), it
                is based on the feeling that the user “creating a disruptive atmosphere” with “percieved hostility toward other users”, and this is the feeling most people get when you tell them that they are factually wrong. So you end up
                banning any knowledge that contradicts anybody.
            </p>
            <p>
                What it amounts to is disallowing criticism of any authoritative statement using first principles reasoning, since the reasoning by its nature is unsourced and it “rudely” challenges safe conventions. It makes people
                extremely uncomfortable when something they believe is challenged, and it feels like a direct and most personal insult. Any scientist will know the feeling, it’s what you felt when you first heard the outlines of BFSS
                theory, before it was accepted.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will never get people on public forums to see the difference, therefore, for these forums to function as scientific sources containing factual knowledge, you must get rid of all the civility rules altogether. On these
                sites, the politics come straight from the pits of hell, the moderators are playing a social game, they never contradict each other, and they behave as a one-mind herd. Any moderator that disagrees with another one is
                stripped of moderatorship quickly. Conflict is always resolved in the moderator’s favor, which means get rid of all conflict. This makes a strong disincentive to criticism, since moderators are politicians and they never
                criticize anything.<br />
                This is an internet fact of life— disagreement on technical content, especially unsourced solid arguments contradicting published claims, will lead you to be classified as unbearably, obnoxiously, rude, and it will be used
                as an excuse to get rid of you.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is why civility requirements are incompatible with science, and there is no way to explain the nuances, so you just have to ask the site to tolerate rudeness” and if they say no, or at least if they enforce the no, then
                you leave (it’s easy, you’re blocked).
            </p>

                For Lubos, nobody is demanding anything from a private server, this is not something one can demand. It is within stackexchange’s power, as a private entity, to do whatever the heck they want to do. This is why physicists
                need an independently run forum. If the mathematicians give their forum to area53, they’ll need a one too.

                Lubos was stunningly fair to the cold fusion comments I made on a thread here on TRF, despite more than usual assholish behavior from me, despite me spamming the site with something like 4 comments in a row, and despite the
                fact that he considers these cold fusion ideas “crackpot rants”. This only cemented my certainty that he is an honest to goodness scientist, with actual unwavering integrity (something which one usually could infer from the
                quality of his science commentary, but you never know, sometimes people sell out when not protected by an academic umbrella— I know the pressure). I hope he could read the cold fusion explanation I put on stackexchange, and
                look into the details of deuteron hole banding and 3-body fusion (although this stuff is more condensed matter than he usually studies, there are really no experts here, and the qualitative agreement with otherwise
                completely inexplicable Iwamura mass-spec transmutation data makes me pretty confident that this is the right explanation), because he might have an idea for calculating the lifetime and energy width of the KeV bands, seeing
                what density is required for 3-body fusion rates, estimating cross sections, or perhaps rule it out entirely (not with bogus back of the envelope estimates, but using actual cross section estimates at 20KeV) or find the
                expected x-ray intensity. These were things I was supposed to calculate over thanksgiving, but instead my daughter had an ear infection, and I was busy programming some bio stuff.

                The only issue with math.overflow is that I think they licensed the stackexchange software, and this is expensive. The free clones are not as full featured, but close (I looked at some of them), but branching off of
                math.overflow might be a good idea anyway. I know one of the folks who runs it, but not very well (he was an undergrad prof. of mine, and he is very good). If that doesn’t work, the only expensive thing is the hosting, and
                there might be academic tricks around that (for example, qmechanic and Arnold are profs, and might be able to persuade someone to host a site on a university server). The software issues are really next to nil, even if you
                don’t license the software, and even if you want eye candy, the amount of work required to get a site online isn’t so large (the math.overflow people did it themselves with a full research and teaching load.
            </p>
            <p>Also, since the entire content of SE is licensed under a free license, one can borrow many nice questions without asking, the theoretical physics ones and research-level ones for sure.</p>
            <p>But I hope one agrees that one will not censor ideas, just downvote them (if they deserve it). I really don’t want to suppress anything of potential value, and that means tolerating a certain amount of downvoted junk.</p>

                Free stackexchange clones exist, they are reasonable. I do not have any attachment to the site anymore, I only liked it because I could tell it was free for sure (and I could tell because I wasn’t banned). I am not
                interested in “role playing games”, I hate online games. My addiction is to doing justice for the underrecognized marginalized folks, and for advertizing their results and for exposing the charlatans and frauds, and the
                fraudulent ideas, that have high positions in the field today. This doesn’t take a lot of effort if you know what you’re talking about. Lubos has been doing it here for years. We disagree on some of the technical content,
                but not on the need for honest criticism of dogmatic claims.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are wrong about the financial aspects— the reason this happened now is because I came to a bunch of other sites (like stackoverflow) and annoyed them with asshole behavior, complaining about the moderation on skeptics,
                and saying that they need to tolerate assholes, like the physicists do. This is a goad to them to try to get the physicists to stop doing it. If the site is capable of being taken over by shog9, then I’m going to get banned,
                and I don’t want to waste too much time, get it over with early, because the longer you’re there, the harder it is to migrate your text to the next forum.
            </p>
            <p>The previous forum was wikipedia, they were totally free until around 2008. The one before was usenet.</p>
            <p>I only used stackexchange because it was science, and it was open (or at least, it quickly turned open with a little bit of prodding), so it gives a way to say correct things that can’t be said elsewhere:</p>
            <p>1. Large extra dimensions are bunk</p>
            <p>2. Cold fusion is not.</p>
            <p>3. Loop quantum gravity has degenerated into obviously false nonsense (although the ideas are still annoyingly mathematically interesting).</p>
            <p>4. S-matrix theory was suppressed unfairly.</p>
            <p>
                and so on and so on. I tried to mix answers to well known stuff, some new calculations that didn’t take more than a day or two to do, and proselyzing for discarded stuff. There are also smaller things, like recognizing Chew
                and Mandelstam for their contribution to string theory, and Candlin for Grassman integration.
            </p>
            <p>
                But mostly it serves as a publishing avenue for original stuff that is suppressed elsewhere, that you are just not allowed to say because of the politics of science. This is the purpose the internet serves. It also served
                the purpose of publically refereeing some wrong stuff in the literature. It was easy enough to do both things when anyone is free to criticise and argue, because nobody could come and claim stupid things with impugnity (as
                some nuclear physicist just came and did on my last answer, with no fear of getting called out or exposed for charlatanry), because they would get _called out on it publically_, by knowledgable people. Those people who
                didn’t know their stuff either learned it, or got intimidated and left, or else stuck to answering really simple questions.

                That’s the way it should be. That’s the way math.overflow works, and this is why math is having a reneissance the likes of which we haven’t seen since, well, the reneissance. (I am sorry Lubos for spamming your site, I’ll

                Lubos, of course I don’t mean taking anything away from anybody. I mean a new site, like math.overflow, with a new host and a new domain (and run on available free q/a forum software). As for the religion, there is such a
                religion, one which you unconsciously and instinctively follow, which was founded in the 1920s by Wolfgang Pauli. It’s this religion that comanded you to criticise loops, even at great personal and professional cost.

            <p>Hi Lubos, Hi Dilaton (sorry Lubos, I hope you can tolerate this mostly offtopic comment, as I can’t really get in touch with Dilaton).</p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, these events do have permanent consequences, because I can’t return to stackexchange. It is a religious requirement, I can no more do it than a devout Jew can eat pork. I do not participate in ostensibly
                public internet forums which are controlled by silencing authorities, beyond removing spam, off topic or completely incomprehensible things, libelous material or otherwise legally questionable content, or duplications. All
                those things can be done without content judgement or opinions on individual people. The freedom to express and protect ideas from silencing is paramount, and without it, you can’t have scientific discussion, as all the good
                new ideas would get squelched.

                The moderators have been lying a little about my behavior, but this is usual in these circumstances. The thing I have said about Larian Lequella is “He is an authoritarian moderator, he knows nothing about physics, he will
                wreck the site, don’t vote for him, vote qmechanic / manishearth” (although I regert it now, after hearing manishearth’s disheartening conformist answers in the Town Hall Chat— I should have gone with Chris Gerig, he’s
                honest and fair). An election where you can’t endorse, or discuss voting strategy is not an election at all, it is a false front for appointing people. This is exactly how the elections were managed in the Soviet block
                (Lubos unfortunately knows something about this)— you had candidates you couldn’t criticize, and you couldn’t coordinate your vote.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shog9 deleted the statements that said “Don’t vote for Larian, and don’t split your vote, vote qmechanic / manishearth”, because this was the one thing most likely to actually affect the election. I kept rolling back his
                changes, precisely because it would affect the election, and then he locked the post, and said “Do not revert or else”. I reverted, with “Or else what?” The whole exchange was deleted, and I was blocked. This was the
                instigating thing— challenging shog9’s authority, and of course I would do it again, and I encourage you to do it too. When you leave, it’s best to leave in a blaze of glory.
            </p>
            <p>
                I behave the way I do for a reason— I speak openly and I am extremely insulting to the gods, to the gods, to collectives which work by authority. This is something that is very easy to do, if you are independent minded, and
                it’s interesting, because you learn about the properties of collective intelligences. When you insult the collectives, the people involved will get _pissed off_, but it will be funny, because they won’t know exactly _why_,
                because you didn’t insult them directly. For example, say hello to a psychiatrist, and ask him if antidepressants cause brain damage to children. She’ll get pissed whether or not she has presecribed antidepressants, to
                children or adults. Or tell a biologist why he believes in modern synthesis evolution, when it’s clearly a load of bullcrap. Or mention cold fusion to a physicist. Or do what Lubos did to get kicked out of Harvard— question
                Lee Smolin’s honesty in print. Lubos, I admire you to death for having done that. It required balls of steel, and this is why I never criticize you no matter how many times you call me a crackpot. Your criticism of loop
                quantum gravity has been cogent and reliable, and I have learned a lot from it, and it came from honestly devoting effort to it, not from some knee-jerk seat of the pants feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
                If collective dogma can’t be challenged openly, if this is not celebrated, or at least accepted and tolerated, then inexorably it follows that people with truly new ideas, like Lubos, are going to be shut up. Every (correct,
                nontrivial) new idea is 10 times more insulting to the established order than anything I can say off the cuff by design. The attacks on string theory are an example of this collective hysteria, this is the reaction of the
                gods to a challenge, and there are herds of people who will do their bidding.

                The political trajectory on stackexchange exactly followed that of Wikipedia— it was completely open for a few years, because the higher ups needed a collection of experts to establish their credentials, then a sudden phase
                transition as the authoritarian idiots take over, and then nobody is safe, and the site productivity grinds to a halt. Because of my behavior, purposefully finding all sorts of socially annoying things to say and do, I am a
                self-appointed canary in the coalmine. You can tell if a site is honest and sensibly moderated by simply checking if I am banned.
            </p>
            <p>
                Until recently, on physics.stackexchange, I was not banned. That means that even the most eccentric folks were allowed to speak their mind and their ideas would be protected (and downvoted, but so what). But a few months
                ago, an abrasive user named Georg got banned— that was a warning, but I missed it. It’s all over now. The new moderators will not allow the freedom to explore ideas and write honestly about them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The freedom of physics stackexchange int he recent past was hard-won. I don’t think you remember there were attempts to ban me a year ago by members that gave up and left. These first attempts were defeated because these
                people are physicists, and the honesty is inculcated in physics culture. The current censorious crowd are politicians, and one cannot defeat them except by making a new site.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you know a good hosting, one can set up a new site with guarantees of complete permanent protection for nontrivial original ideas, but otherwise similar to stackexchange. I would, if involved, allow questions of the form
                “referee this paper: [link]”, where you would just post an arxiv paper, and allow people to referee it, with voting, in public. This would be better than the political horseshit that goes on during private refereeing behind
                the scenes in journals, and it can perhaps substitute for this archaic system. Please remember that Einstein published without refereeing, and the modern system was only set up in the 1950s, and after some notable successes
                (1957 was a very good year, BCS theory, Bohmian dynamics, Everett’s many-worlds, Mandelstam’s double-dispersion relations, lot of stuff), it was all downhill. By the late 60s, quarks were censored, by the 70s, string theory
                was censored, by the 80s, lots of stuff was censored, and by the 90s, the ratio of science to bullshit in journals was at an all time low.
            </p>
            <p>
                Usenet and the internet in general helped a lot, and by now most of the egregious stuff is gone. I would be happy to provide a forum which can serve as a public refereeing site. I hoped stackexchange could be this forum, but
                in its current form, the moderation atmosphere makes it impossible to have an open discussion, as had been the rule until a few days ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would also like to see questions which simply ask for experimental data, published or unpublished, maybe some lying around in a lab. This is useful, as there is a ton of data which can’t be put up anywhere, because it
                doesn’t come with a conclusion attached.
            </p>
            <p>Also, on a future site, I would prefer to completely exclude unoriginal stuff (like homework, or well known textbook things) by closing them with a one-line answer, or sending people to stackexchange.</p>
            <p>I don’t know if this is a pipe dream or not. It’s not like I can afford the hosting, although I think I can set up or modify the software as necessary.</p>

                Yes, I’ll submit a few articles somewhere after a few weekends (I have an interesting bioinformatics money job I have been neglecting) . This will consist of three major parts: 1. The theory of deep holes— the K-shell
                electrons. These are described by the creation-annihilation inverted nonrelativistic spinning Schrodinger field (the Pauli field equation, or the nonrelativistic Dirac equation). They behave as positive charged particles
                with negative mass, and this allows you to compute the X-ray transition spectra (including selection rules) from single particle QM. The results are interesting, as they allow you to simply calculate the Moseley law
                screening coefficient from Hartree fock type effective potentials in the electron ground state very accurately. 2. The interaction of these deep holes with deuterons in a deuterated metal leads to the banding of X-rays in
                hydrogenated metals (this will be uncontroversial and important), this allows X-ray refraction and easy downconversion, together with potential solid state X-ray laser, not plasma (although such a laser will be risky with
                deuterium, due to the risk of small atomic explosion). The band-width calculation I haven’t done but it’s not hard 3. The effective field theory of deuteron resonances— there are about 6 of these. The coefficients for
                transitions between these are not observed in cases where you have a strong electric field. I tried to formulate this theory about 3 years ago, but there wasn’t enough data. I think it might be possible to get around this
                with some heuristic estimates using some nuclear potentials. This requires more expertise in nuclear physics. 4. The wavefunction of the deuterons in certain positions in the X-ray band (it has a lot of states) will
                correspond to classical orbits which go around from nucleus to nucleus with turning points of closest approach arount 100fm. The quantitative estimates for the fusion probability when such states have a given occupation
                number can be given from the theory in 4. The important thing is the electrostatic transfer of energy to the nucleus, which leads to fragmentation similar to electron bombardment at 20 MeV (this involves a virtual photon of
                about the same energy). This leads to nuclear fragmentation and recoil which is quantitatively understood from some 1970s measurements of electron nuclear interaction. The resulting fragmentation spectrum involves a whole
                bunch of different species, and one will have a roughly quantitatively accurate list of emitted light isotopes during fusion. There is a lot of nuclear data for what happens when these isotopes collide with heavy nuclei, but
                the general estimates can be just from the Coulomb barrier to estimate absorption probability, and assuming absorption plus gamma/beta decay or one-particle or one-alpha ejection is the major tranmutation source. This allows
                you to give a quantitative prediction for the tranmutation spectrum for the cold fusion which is a smoking-gun signature— you get light elements and heavy elements obeying a sum rule: (Pd-X)+X = (Pd+X) where X is a light
                ejecta, and (plus minus one or two in charge to account subsequent beta decay, and with some corrections for known alpha ejection probability). These will be for all transmutations in mass more than +4. For less than +4, the
                tranmutation spectrum is the exactly same as Pd and d bombardment with 10-20 MeV alphas in a precise distribution (which is dependent on what ejecta comes out). This is exactly consistent with Wolf and Iwamura’s
                transmutation data (although I should read Mizuno’s book, which is available).

                Hi Lubos, I won’t bother you again, but I am now certain the theory is correct, as I have figured out the last major discrepancy with the observation. The fusion-near-a-nucleus story is correct, and you can see it is true
                because if you have a K-shell hole and you kick a deuteron, it will get just enough KE to approach the nucleus to the distance of a K-shell hole, i.e. 100 fermis. This gives a classical turning point, and a wavefunction
                enhancement as the inverse square-root of the classical velocity, and when two such accelerated deuterons meet, they meet right next to a Pd nucleus, leading to the 3-body fusion. The bands are real, the fusion is real, the
                result is excess heat at 24 MeV per deuteron pair, and if you were clever, you could have predicted it theoretically with no experimental data already before 1989.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason I am certain is the pattern of transmutation products in the Pd, it matches the theoretical predictions to a tee. At first I thought the transmutations would only happen _after_ the fusion, from the alpha
                bombardment, but that’s not true. A fusion by a nucleus transferring the energy electrostatically fragments the nucleus. The theory is complete, and I am very happy. You don’t need to publish this, I thought you might like
                to know.

                In a nutshell— high energy particles don’t thermalize crystals, as was known already to Bohr, high energy charged particles deposit energy in ionization of atoms, highest energy levels first. This makes thermalization very
                inefficient, and the result is that you can have materials emitting X-rays at KeV energies without melting the lattice, even though X-rays have an energy corresponding to a temperature of millions of degrees. When an MeV
                electron or proton goes through a crystal, the crystal doesn’t locally melt, it ionizes and reemits X-rays.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a phase-space restriction on the thermalization, it occurs because you can’t locally melt a crystal by just kicking the nucleus, because this would fully ionize the nucleus. You would need to kick the entire atomic
                core, the nucleus plus inner electrons, and that is phase space impossible. What happens instead is that electrons are kicked out individually. This was described by Hans Bethe in the 1940s, using QED. The Bethe formula
                correctly predicts the stopping times of charged particles in matter of all sorts, and is well established science.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bethe’s process does not lead to melting, it leads to secondary X-ray and beta emissions. The beta emissions are from electrons falling back into the K-shell (and other shell) holes produced by the charged particle. In a
                deuterated metal, the deuterons don’t have cores, and they can be kicked around. The deuterons accelerate from K-shell holes and charged particles, they fuse near a nucleus, and the resulting fast charged particle emissions
                lead to more K-shell holes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The K-shell energy of Pd is 20KeV. The fusion rate of beams on deuterated Pd is published and available, and the neutron emission fusion rate is 1 in 100,000 atoms or so, at around 3KeV, before the deuterons stop. The rate
                is not negligible at 1KeV, because of known tunneling enhancements to fusion cross sections, things that are known from hot fusion and muon catalyzed fusion.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know this is your blog, but have some freaking respect for scientific honesty. I have just demolished your retarded argument against cold fusion, so please change your mind on this, and do it quickly. Anything else is not
                befitting a scientist.

            <p>
                You don’t need to publish this comment if you don’t want to— it’s just a correction to your remarks below: the K-shell of Pd is a little over 20KeV, around 22KeV. The next level is at 3KeV. The beam cross section for fusion
                on deuterated palladium(yes, this experiment is done!) is 1 d-d neutron emitting fusion in 10,000-100,000 at around 3-20KeV, (I forgot the exact numbers, it was something like some thousands of fusions in a beam of a billion
                particles but I can dig up the paper if you want). The K-shell is not “something like KeV”, it is exactly what I give here, and the fusion rate at 20KeV is not at all negligible, it’s very high (this is higher temperature
                than the center of the sun, if converted to thermal units). The enhancement of fusion that lowers the barrier for d-d fusion to KeV’s as opposed to MeV’s (which is the naive classical Coulomb barrier for deuterons to touch)
                is well known, it is what allows ordinary fusion in H-bombs and muon-catalyzed fusion, and all other known accepted forms— it’s ordinary quantum tunnelling during the scattering process. Please fix these errors, as these are
                a little bit demoralizing considering your usual scientific honesty.

        <div>
            <p>Yes, Lubos, you are absolutely right— the KeV’s would be impossible if they would be thermal energy. This is how I am sure they aren’t thermal.</p>
            <p>
                You are wrong about reproductions of Pons/Fleischamann, many reproductions succeeded in 1989, at least 3 immediately, and all of them would have succeeded if they had patience to run for a few weeks on good samples at high
                deuteron loading, as Pons and Fleischmann had patience. Further, the lack of reproducibility is a scientific fraud propagated by hot-fusion folks at MIT. But people bought it because of the thermalization argument you give.
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole cold fusion thing is extraordinarily out of equilibrium— the energy is in ridiculous modes far far above any thermal modes in energy: K-shell holes and KeV deuterons. These take many steps to turn into thermal
                energy. Usually, they don’t turn thermal at all, they just emit X-rays which escape the material. You might be puzzled by this. Why don’t they turn thermal?
            </p>
            <p>
                High energy particles don’t have a lot of thermal friction. This is the paradox of high-energy particles. You would naively think they would quickly thermalize their energy into thermal modes. But they don’t. They don’t heat
                up the solid, they ionize it, and preferentially in inner shells. This is well known since the 1910s experimentally, understanding this was a major motivation for Bohr in 1913, and it was completely explained by QED in the
                1940s, by Hans Bethe. The Bethe theory describes what happens to fast charged ionizing radiation, it loses energy to ionizing atoms in a line, and with a completely non-thermal energy distribution— the high energy modes are
                much more likely to be excited than the low-energy modes. The high energy modes then produce X-rays at KeV energies, not thermal photons at fractions of an eV.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result stays a crystal, the solid doesn’t melt locally, it just is ionized. This is even though the energy, if translated to thermal terms, would be millions or billions of degrees. These ionized atoms just can’t melt
                the crystal, because a nucleus can’t be kicked all together with it’s core electrons (even though there is enough energy to do this), this is phase-space impossible. All you can do is kick out an individual electron. It’s
                the phase-space problem that a melted solid is not immediately phase-space accessible from a crystal solid by kicking a single particle.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, you can kick a deuteron, because a deuteron has no core. So there is no obstacle to having fast deuterons in a crystal, as there is to having fast Pd cores. Ionizing radiation can dump its energy into
                ionizing electrons or accelerating deuterons, but not into melting the crystal. This is why we have X-ray emissions without crystal melting, and you are right that back-of-the-envelope, these are not possible (this is why
                you need to understand QED to understand high energy particle energy transfer).
            </p>
            <p>
                The cold fusion process is exploiting the long thermalization time to do many fusions before the crystal melts. The crystal eventually does melt, it explodes in little clumps a few microns across. This is what happens to
                cold fusion devices. Scanning electron microscopy on used cathodes shows that they are full of micron-scale pits where the Pd melted and exploded outward. The heat output is in extremely localized flashes at very high energy
                on the surface, it isn’t uniform. This was another clue for me as to the theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                But melting the crystal only happens after a bazillion fusions, once the KeV scale levels have time to mix with thermal levels. This is what prevents a runaway chain-reaction and an explosion, the chain reaction stops once
                the solid melts and the deuterons are far from ionized atoms. Still, you can have a chain-reaction in Pd/d, and there are explosions (although not of nuclear scale). The self-limiting aspects are what make this interesting.

            <p>
                Hi Lubos, I must say one thing right up front— you are right about Widom Larsen theory (the idea that there is inverse beta decay in metals), it is preposterous. There are no neutrons produced on metals, and this is obvious
                from the MeV difference in mass. It is also true that Rossi is running a scam.
            </p>
            <p>
                But cold fusion research was for 2 decades a Palladium-deuterium project, and there the results are iron-clad. The heat measurements of Pons/Fleischmann have been replicated many times over in hundreds of laboratories. The
                evidence for nuclear transmutations are available in extremely lucid experimental papers by Mosier-Boss and collaborators at SPAWAR. Please _read these papers_ before dismissing them, as I am sure they will mystify you as
                they mystified me. I was scratching my head at the particle emission results for a week or more, before I finally had to give in and admit something nuclear was happening. The evidence is overwhelming, and it had to be for
                me, because I started out as skeptical as you.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am no longer skeptical. But I also think I know what is going on. The major clue was the Mosier-Boss charged alpha and charged particle observations. These tell you that the energies involved are not particularly low, the
                alphas come out in a continuous spectrum &lt;~ 20MeV, while the other charged stuff is KeV scale. There are also KeV X-rays with KeV energies emitted. The key point is that K-shells in Pd can accelerate lattice deuterons.
                This is very simple to see, it is exactly parallel to K-shell accelerating an electron (a well known process). The K-shell hole (an ejected n=1 electron) absorbes a random electron near the Fermi surface, and uses this
                energy to kick another electron. Instead of kicking an electron, in a deuterated metal, it can kick a deuteron. The kicked deuteron flies through the lattice at 20KeV, and can fuse. If the fusion is near a Pd nucleus, there
                are symmetries broken that can open up a fusion channel where the energy is dumped into the nucleus, instead of to a proton or a neutron (this is something you can't observe in dilute beam fusion). The result is a
                nucleus-fragment and an alpha-particle moving at 24 MeV altogether, and this produces the broad spectrum alpha-emission observed by Mosier-Boss et al. The fast-moving alphas produce more holes (up to 1000 of them, by energy,
                although probably less, more like 100-400). So long as only 1 in 100 accelerated deuterons fuse, you have a chain reaction. Fusion cross sections at 20KeV are not particularly humongous (but they aren't small either), and
                deuterons at 20KeV going though deuterated Pd do not fuse at a rate of 1 in 100 before they stop, but rather at a rate of about 1 in 10,000. This is the 2 orders of magnitude missing from the theory. But there are caveats:
                1. the fusion is detected by looking for neutrons and protons, so this is the conventional fusion of the beam in the metal. You might have a lot more undetected fusion which is d+d fusion with a specator nucleus, which you
                don't see, because it doesn't generate neutrons you detect. 2. the deuterons and K-shell holes together make bands of unstable delocalized excitations. These bands can plausibly concentrate the wavefunctions of the colliding
                deuterons into special configurations which are focused near a nucleus, with greater concentration than an impinging beam. It's not ruled out to get a large factor in intensity of the collisions, since the wavefunctions for
                the K-shell electron-holes are concentrated in 100fermi shells near the nucleus. It is also not implausible to have most of the fusions happen near a nucleus, to absorb the energy momentum. The bands can also lead the
                K-shell deuteron states to migrate to a surface, and attain higher density of fast deuterons, they act like a conductor at KeV energies (although their lifetime is not so great, it is long enough to do many many hops before
                they decay by X-ray). These phenomena are certainly there in the metal, since they are required by current theory, but whether they are responsible for cold fusion remains to be seen. But considering that I am not invoking
                magic, I think you should consider your dogmatic insistence that cold fusion is ruled out. Maybe H-Ni fusion is, but deuterium fusion in Pd is not, and I consider the present experimental evidence that it is happening
                overwhelming.

                You are wrong about Obama’s religion— it is sincere, as is obvious from his autobiography. The religious impulse is not about superstition or miracles, it is about the long, hard struggle for justice in a world that rewards
                great evil with power and money. The African American community has the advantage of a homegrown tradition of sincere religious worship, without blinders about the challenges that the community faces. It is this religious
                spiritual strength that played a big role in allowing the civil rights movement to succeed as it did. Obama is aware of this history, and appreciates the power of Christian religion to play a role in ensuring that the
                powerless are made powerful, that they, in the words of a famous text, shall inherit the Earth.

                Obama is sensibly secular in his policies, but he is religious in conviction. This is to be contrasted with many on the right who are the exact opposite. I am sure that Obama, as most religious Americans, does not believe
                there was a literal boat and a flood, or that God literally parted the red sea. But looking at the massive transformations that religious faith enables, who the heck cares, He might as well have.

                Jeremiah Wright is a preacher who has emphasized the social justice aspects of Christianity. His sermon “The Audacity to Hope” is a classic, and inspired Obama’s autobiography title. The thesis of this sermon (it is truly
                great, and you can hear all of it online) is that it is not natural to maintain hope under trying circumstances, rather, it is an audacious step, a bewilderingly irrational step, and yet, historically, over long enough
                periods of time, it is justified. One should not conflate this uplifting and true observation with the idea that God wants you to heckle your same-sex neighbors or throw women with too-short skirts out of society.
