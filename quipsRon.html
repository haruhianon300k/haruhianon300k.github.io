It works as counterpropaganda when it comes from both sides equally, and when there are two equally vicious sides, people look at the evidence.</span></div></li></ul><div><span style="color: rgb(42, 46, 46);"><font face="Calibri" style="font-size: 11pt;"><br/></font></span></div><ul><li><div><font face="Calibri" style="font-size: 11pt;">People must never be nice, it is evil to be polite.</font></div></li><li><div><font face="Calibri" style="font-size: 11pt;">Censorship is evil, and civility is evil.</font></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri;">The imminent threat is right there in this article. Trolling is a human right.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri;">It may be sickening, I don’t care. I should continue until you snap out of the delusion.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri;">The invention of bogus real-world threats is simply to whip up a frenzy for internet censorship, which is the kiss of death. I won't support it under any circumstances, and I consider you a traitor to the internet for even thinking that there is a problem at all.</span></div></li></ul><div><br/><hr/><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Because &quot;harm&quot; is not measured in &quot;milli-harm-farads&quot;. Your plot is meaningless gibberish made to look scientific. Downvoted and you should take it down.</span></div><hr/><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Smoking MARIJUANA outside your home, in the street, is a form of assault, which wrecks bystanders brains. I don't give a crap about any other drug, it can't affect anyone except the user. The worst infringement of liberty of another person is forcing them to ingest brain-altering chemicals. It is worse than physical assault, it is killing another person's soul. </span></div><div><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><br/></font></div><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Other than that, not really. But that's the big one. It happens all the time. Anywhere there are housing projects, you can't go anywhere without marijuana damage inflicted on you. It's the worst thing in the world, except for purposefully taking some other drug.</span></div><hr/><div><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><br/></font></div><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165); font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;-evernote-highlight:true;">I am not saying &quot;I think Marlowe wrote it&quot;, because the truth is, I was dragged kicking and screaming by Farey and Mendenhall to this view, and it is 100% persuasive, and there can be no argument.</span></span></div><div><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><br/></font></div><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165); font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;-evernote-highlight:true;">I don't care what scholars think, I do not rely on authority, I rely on mathematics and thinking for myself. And the weight of the stylometric evidence compiled by Farey, together with the additional stylometries since, is reasonably conclusive. I urge people to review the stylometries, without expert help, they can come to no other honest conclusion than the one I reached.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Heh. You linked my question on stackexchange. This is where I found out about the latest Charniak stylometries, the ones I link above.</span></div><div><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><br/></font></div><hr/><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">I don't claim expertise, I don't have any authority in any field. I get all my communication out of the asylum written in poo on rolls of toilet paper that I slip out through the bars at night to my devoted but brainwashed lover, who gives me her own rolls containing your response, also written in poo. I don't know why she does that, as she has access to pens.</span></div></li></ul><hr/><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Wait, what the fuck is this? ARE YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT ME EXERCIZING FREE SPEECH? What the fuck is GAB for if not to insult DIMWITTED YELLOW HAIRED FUCKWITS who can't appreciate HALFBREED AFRICAN SCIENCE?</span></div></li></ul><hr/><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">PAULI!!!! PAULI GUESS THE NEUTRINO! Oh my GOD! Are you people THIS CLUELESS?? What the FUCK is WRONG WITH YOU! You pretend to talk about physics without knowing ANYTHING.</span></div></li></ul><hr/><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">HA HA **HAH** (gasp) HAHAHAHAHA! *wipe-tear*. Oh man. Have you READ EINSTEIN?? People LAUGHED AT HIS IDEAS FOR DECADES before they were accepted. There was NOBODY TO STEAL FROM! HAHA, oh boy. That was a good one. I didn't know people as stupid as you were allowed near a computer.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">For example, he won the Nobel prize for his 1905 work introducing PHOTONS, particles of light. That was laughed at by everyone, including Niels Bohr (Dane), Max Planck (German), Gunnar Nordstrom (Swede), everyone. Planck even had to write to the German institute &quot;Einstein is a scientist of the first rank. Ignore his photon paper, that's just some garbage from his youth...&quot; And that attitude persisted until 1919 when the Compton scattering and photoelectric effect measurements of Millikan proved Einstein right about photons, and everyone else, including Bohr and Max Planck had to change their mind, because individual photon kicks had been more or less directly observed.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The same is true for his relativity relations, like E=mc^2, for his wavefunction phases from 1924, for his A-B coefficients, for his stress-energy pseudotensor theory (WHICH WASN'T ACCEPTED FULLY UNTIL 1994, when James York (American) explained it more clearly), his theory of Bose Einstein condensation, his general phase-transition work, for his Brownian motion work, even for his work on tea leaves in a cup and river-meanderings. Everything he wrote is so original, it inspires NOW, a hundred years later. It's also a model of clear thinking and clear writing. So much so, that some of it is still not translated to English, it's too powerful, the elites don't want you to see it.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Marx was a genius in a different field, and in that field, in economics it is hard to do lasting work. But Marx is the father of the demand slump ideas that took over economics in Keynes' time, and he identified the material-conflict of class-dynamics, which was like a searchlight into the humanities, illuminating how power gets distributed in a heirarchical society.</span></div></li></ul><hr/><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">That's not science, this is propaganda. Scientists were all socialists. At least, all the good ones.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ALL.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">OF.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">THEM.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The reason you think socialism and a good economy don't mix is because capitalists sabotage socialist economies. On purpose.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">When Britain went socialist in 1945, the economy recovered and grew quickly. When the Scandinavians went socialist, they became wealthy nations for the first time. When the Yugoslavs went socialist, they kicked everyone's ass with economic growth.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">When the USSR stopped being socialist in 1991, the economy shrank by 50%, millions of people died, and the whole area hasn't recovered in population or economic activity to this day. The end of socialism was the worst catastrophe the USSR went through. And that includes Stalin, and that includes World War II.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">There are bad policies and there are good policies. There are capitalist policies and there are socialist policies. The world is too complicated for simple formulas.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">But if you want a simple slogan: Four legs good. Two legs bad.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The &quot;Capitalism&quot; you are showing is the WEST after Keynesianism. Keynesianism is &quot;Marx lite&quot;. It's how you get half of the benefits of Marxism, with only a little bit of taxes and some spending.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Before Keynesianism, Capitalism produced permanent depression. After Republicans got rid of Keyensianism, it again produces permanent depression.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">To see capitalism at work, look at Brazil, or Argentina.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The ones that killed millions of people were your guys. The &quot;alt right&quot;. You don't know history, because you are stupid.</span></div><hr/><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">I'm not a liberal, and I am a scientist. The sun's output never changes, because the time scale for the changes are a billion years. The total heat that comes out is determined by fusion rates at the center of the sun. That is steady as fuck for billions of years, until the hydrogen runs out.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The only thing that changes are magnetic fields at the surface, and that's sunspots.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Every once in a while there is a sunspot minimum. The billionaire liars then tell you there's a &quot;grand solar minimum&quot; (of sunspots) and pretend this has an effect on the climate, to DECIEVE YOU.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">You are not educated enough to not fall for thei lies. I am helping you out. You're welcome.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Total solar irradiance never changes. It is the same year, after year, after year. It never goes up, it never goes down. It's the same now as 100 years ago, or 1000 years ago, or 10,000 years ago, or 100,000 years ago, and it will be the same for millions of years into the future. It has no cycles. It has no variability.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">That's why scientists know that you are propaganda, and it hurts, because you are doing the work of the most evil people on Earth. And no, I am not confused, and there is 0% chance that I made a mistake. I am a scientist.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The sun's output never changes, you mental midget. The sun does NOTHING on human time scales, it never has, it never will. The &quot;leaf mass&quot; increases a little, and huge areas turn to desert. The ocean turns acidic, the insects die out, and we're all fucked.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Greenhouse gasses drive climate change. That's not an opinion, you worthless propagandist, it's a fact. And you are selling your children down the river, which means you are damned.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The &quot;solar minimum&quot; is about sunspots and magnetic fields, and surface weather on the sun. THE SUN NEVER CHANGES HOW MUCH IT SHINES. It's always the same, never varying even by a little bit, for billions of years.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The polar bears are threatening the Inuit because they are DISPLACED as a result of climate change. They are not a threatened species now. The threat now is to insects and to the ocean microbiome, the itty bitty things swimming in the oceans.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">You are doing propaganda so as to kill your children. That isn't worth any paycheck. If you are not paid, you are not educated, and you need to get up to speed right now, before you ever post again.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Except that those species are disappearing too. The entire insect population has dropped by 3/4, likely due to warming temperatures affecting insect eggs in unknown ways.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">No, we don't know why. It's one idea. The insect population is dropping in Europe too. It's a pressing research problem to figure out what's causing it. It is likely warming, because Bt plants are illegal in Europe.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">This is a major emergency, and it would be better if you learned science and helped figure it out, rather than just doing propaganda for morons online.</span></div><hr/><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">This is one of the greatest paintings made in our time, the first real art in many years. Thank you for introducing me to it through your irrational hatred.</span></div></li></ul><hr/><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Waltons are the wealthiest family in the world. Jeff Bezos is the wealthiest man. the most influential in the US are the Koch brothers. None of these people are Jewish and all of them are working together against YOU, regardless of whether you are Jewish or not.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">COMMIES can TROLL better than you. JOIN US, and you can meme far better than has ever been memed on the right. Because you are making memes for justice, and a better world, not for hate.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">I am not a communist exactly. I don't like Stalin or Mao. I don't support Marxism-Leninism. But whatever.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">For YOU, I AM a communist. Because you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between different kinds of left, and it's good to read Lenin and Stalin and Mao, and learn what they REALLY did, even though a lot of it wasn't good.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The whole &quot;Jewish&quot; thing is a mentally retarded conspiracy theory. By the way (((I))) (((am))) (((a))) (((Jew))), (((so))) (((I))) (((would))) (((say))) (((that))), (((wouldn't))) (((I))).</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Jews didn't create the &quot;fake money&quot; system, central banking was created all over the world by different bankers, to replace gold standard, and unify small banks so that you wouldn't have different currencies in every town, and so that nations can control who gets to mint more money.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Central banking is SHIT, but it's NOT JEWISH SHIT.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Fake money is what Shays fought for in the post-revolutionary REAL AMERICAN REVOLUTION. You call it &quot;Shays rebellion&quot;. It was against the rich, and it failed. Then there was more than a hundred years of &quot;Free Silver&quot; to get paper money.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">There was paper money in the civil war, that led to an economic boom. When the gold standard was reintroduced, it led to contractions and busts. That's the end of the 19th century, and the William Jennings Bryan movement.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">They won. They got paper money. The result is a central bank run by shadowy figures.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">What you want is an OPEN CENTRAL BANK, audited, which is part of the government and has no private bankers.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">You ALSO want to have NO FOR-PROFIT BANKING. banking profits are too easy, you can skim off the billions you generate out of thin air. These reforms make sense.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">But it has nothing to do with Jews. And the only people who will do this stuff are people who AREN'T BOUGHT OUT. You know what we call those people?</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">SOCIALISTS.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">COMMIES to you.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(((I)))(((am)))(((a)))((((JEW))), how many times do I NEED TO SAY IT!</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">National Socialist memes are STUPID, and they are OFFENSIVE, because they are boring. They're old. They're from the NINETEEN THIRTIES. They aren't ORIGINAL, and they are written and drawn by drooling retards who never went to school.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Try MARX MEMES, because MARX WAS INTELLIGENT.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Try ATLEE MEMES, and TITO MEMES. Those socialists BEAT THE NAZIS. They sent them straight to hell, where they belong. Now they're tossing and turning there.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">And get an education, read Marx, read the socialists. They really have things to say.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">No, they really aren't. Tito and Soviet memes won the war for a reason. They were better memes. Just that the CAPITALISTS have hidden all the Soviet memes, because they scare the shit out of them. That's the truth.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">I AM A LEFTIST. Leftists can meme better than the right, that's how World War II was won. The leftist memes are Soviet, and Capitalists refused to preserve them.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">For example of Soviet memes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yl-DvkX0hY or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmTEW61CYdY</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Leftists are neither confused nor misguided. Sadly, you are. Because you have lost your faith in God, you have lost your faith in humanity and that means you lost your faith in the future, so that all you see is nihilism and pain.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Many leftists just look down on the far-right, won't talk to you, because they see you as beyond salvation. I don't see people as refuse, we are all a part of humanity, and I won't let a sinking man drown without at least trying to help.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">It's not a plug-figure, or fudge-factor, and that bad first-impression is why scientists took 70 years to accept it.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Zwicky noticed dark-matter in the 1930s, studying galaxy clusters. The speeds of galaxies were too high to keep them close to each other unless there was 5 times more mass around the galaxies. Vera Rubin in the 60s noticed that galaxies spin too fast to stay together, unless there is 3 times more matter at least. Cosmologists in the 90s found the exact same amount of dark-matter from cosmological observation, which got refined, so we know there is exactly 5 times more dark matter, and only after direct detection of Vera Rubin's dark matter with weak-lensing, and verification that it moves differently than ordinary matter, did it get accepted as actual dark matter, and not just a plug figure</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">That's how long it took. Because of that reaction you had. If scientists were more objective, it would have been accepted when Zwicky showed it was there, in 1935.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">No, they showed that dark matter existed in two different ways. There is nothing unusual about 'dark matter', we have neutrinos, which are 'dark' except for weak interactions.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Claiming that the 'gravity model is wrong' shows you don't understand General Relativity. We understand gravity better than Newton did since Einstein developed a new theory a hundred years ago. Sorry you didn't get the memo.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Anything that &quot;holds matter together&quot; is gravity, we understand all the forces of nature at those scales, that's why we have to build accelerators to get to place we don't understand.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Since you don't know anything, it would be best if you stopped posting.</span></div><hr/><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">I'm a physicist you idiot. I also read Dirac's papers, and Heisenberg's, and Feynman's, and Dyson's, and Schwinger's, and DeWitt's, and Fadeev's, and Landau's and Pieirls, and Anderson's, and Polyakov's and Hawking's and Witten's AND A MILLION OTHERS, because that was what I trained for decades to do. You goddamn moron. Not everyone is as stupid as you.</span></div></li></ul><hr/><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">No, that's a lie. The amount of CO2 humans put out is millions of times greater than any volcano.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">You're a fucking idiot. I am talking about CO2, the thing that is belched out by people. CO is unstable, and you can ignore it. Like methane. The only thing that determines the temperature of the atmosphere over the long term is CO2, because water goes in and out, and CO2 never changes, except when humans burn carbon.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">That California lake is not representative of the climate, you need to look at ice cores, because those tell you atmospheric temperature. That lake was warmed by something else, like volcanic activity, or some sort of cover, or a million other possibilities. There is only thing that determines average global temperature, which is CO2. This is known for over 100 years.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">If you are paid to do lying propaganda, quit, you are damning youself to hell. If you are unpaid, learn science immediately, and stop being a moronic tool for an oil company billiionaire.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">No, it is not. There are no other variables. It is a one parameter system.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">H2O is slave to CO2, because it evaporates back and forth from the ocean. Methane is unstable, and turns to CO2 after about a year. The sun never changes. The average radiative output never changes.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">That is why the only long term determinant is CO2, you can plot temperature vs. CO2 using ice cores and correctly predict the response of climate. There's nothing complicated there.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">This is why CO2 is the focus of the studies, and this is also why you don't need a computer to predict the effect.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The reason you don't know this is because oil billionaires are lying to you. If you are paid to lie, quit, you are damning yourself to hell. If you are just a sucker, educate yourself, it's not hard to do.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Polar bears are the LEAST OF OUR PROBLEMS. Insect populations are COLLAPSING. Plankton and small marine life is dying out. Those are the base of the food chain. Please, stop talking about nonsense and work to stop this calamity before it turns into the worst extinction the world has ever seen, because that's what is going on right now, right before your eyes.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">And that's not alarmism, that's just the truth.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">That is not true. It's not POLLUTION, it's CO2, because the only thing that matters for average global temperature is CO2.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">To get rid of CO2, you need to stop INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS. You need to stop agricultural emissions. You need to develop sequestration, and you need to plant trees. Airplanes are not the worst or most significant source of CO2, they are a relatively small source. But private jets should not exist, and you need to tax CO2.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">I have not been fooled, you moron. I am a scientist. I worked it out for myself in the early 80s, as a little kid. It's a simple scientific fact, CO2 is the way the Earth keeps warm.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">What I am telling you is not &quot;fear mongering&quot;, I am telling less than the full horror of the truth, because if one tells the truth, it usually causes people to sink into interminable depression. This has happened to me too.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">You are stupid. And you are brainwashed. And you are sadly too stupid to know that you have been brainwashed. The CO2 we emit is warming the Earth, and it is destroying the base of the food chain. We know what happens when CO2 rises this quickly, because it happened once before, in the worst mass extinction in the geological record.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">We can halt all CO2, and start sequestering, preserve and expand green areas, try to restore the oceans to health. Even then, we are in for hard times, but at least then, we have some hope for a future recovery.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">This is not my opinion, I am telling you facts. There are very wealthy people on the other side paid to lie to you. Nobody wants global warming to be real, but it is real as a brick thrown at your head.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">I don't know if you are being serious or joking, but crazy snow at random times, due to disrupted arctic patterns is one outcome of global warming.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The magnetic field of the Earth doesn't affect the weather, not at all, and long-term, only CO2 affects the climate. The magnetic poles aren't shifting anyway, not with any confidence, they move a few km, they move elsewhere, it's not like it matters. Is this a science group or a wacked-out personal opinion group?</span></div></li></ul><hr/><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Not a tip but just something to be aware. The majority of developers will never understand this, but I hope I can reach the few that could but don't realize that it can.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Modern day programming is just linear programming with a short attention span. You create solutions fast but they all end up buggy as hell when you assemble the pieces. Fast gain only.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">There are more dimensions to program into than these 1D dimensions.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">If you write code then change the code in such a way that it is easy to read AND easy to maintain AND easy to alter AND easy to debug AND easy to test AND easy to deploy. Multi dimensional thinking, like a master painter.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Developing software is never about logic, but by using creativity to create all small parts that can form a cathedral of a project.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Now how can you learn this? Fail, fail, fail fail, that is how you learn it.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Do you even know what &quot;linear programming&quot; means? It has nothing to do with &quot;computer programming&quot;, it's a Soviet method of creating a &quot;program&quot; or an economic plan, using an algorithm to minimize costs. The 'simplex method' produces fast solutions, which revolutionized planning because you could figure out how much you should make of X, Y, Z based on demand and cost, quickly.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">You can't use linear programming to write computer programs. It's completely different, no relation at all.</span></div></li><li><div><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">NO! This is BASIC SHIT. I am not smart for knowing this! You are stupid for NOT knowing it.</span></font></div><div><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">It's because you are a conservative. It's all of you. You're all stupid. I mean, really, really stupid. Rock bottom. Like crustaceans. Or molluscs.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Don't learn design patterns. My experience with design patterns is that it locks you down and restricts solutions in your code. In the end you get over complicated code no one understands anymore 6 months down the development cycle.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">You have no idea how abstract and bloated the code becomes when people use design patterns.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Also design patterns makes your mind numb and you become unable to invent new technology out of nowhere to make your project shine.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">No, it's a pretty good idea. But it's a manager's dream. The object oriented idea is to encapsulate each part of the program as an &quot;object&quot;, which is a collection of data, plus algorithms. The idea is to handle the object only through the algorithms provided as it's interface. It's great for managers, because they can assign objects to individual programmers, and evaluate progress and efficiency by the interfaces you write. Whether they work or not.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">n C++, the object is done with the notion of a &quot;struct&quot; (or class) in which you have data, and functions, where the guts of the struct is 'supposed to be' only visible to the function. You have structs where nobody is allowed to look inside.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">This is a reasonable idea only as long as you make the objects relatively big chunks of program, and self-contained.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">When this was taken by capitalist managers as a design philosophy, and suddenly, you are forced to write code to change a counter using a dedicated function called &quot;increment_counter&quot; instead of just adding 1 to the counter data. Data in real projects often overlaps between &quot;objects&quot; and following the philosophy too far can lead you astray.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Some things aren't &quot;objects&quot;. For example, CODE ITSELF, Or self-modifying code. Like LISP. If you learn LISP, you can see what the object oriented world was trying to do. Half assed.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The point of this was to take something nice from functional programming languages--- modifiable interfaces--- and be able to transport that to compiled efficient languages like C. It's a philosophy, you learn it in a day, you learn C++ in a month, and then go back to C, because once you understand what's going on under the hood, there's nothing much in C++ that's any good.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Of course, this is in a socialist environment. In a capitalist environment, you use the language the boss tells you.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">I think everyone who uses object oriented C knows what they are doing when they put a pointer first.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The interesting thing is when you put TWO pointers first. That's like multiple inheritance, without the headache. Unfortunately, you don't get the nice namespace control. But that's why we have files and #include in C.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The reason to avoid C++ for me is because virtual classes have an opaque viritual function table pointer at the beginning, and making all classes virtual (including little structs like 'complex number') makes your code as slow as high-level language. On a modern machine, that's 8 bytes in every struct, 8 bytes you can't see, 8 bytes you can't strip, and 8 bytes pointing to a location with a table you can't change.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">This violates the first commandment of C: KEEP THE DATA BINARY TRANSPARENT, STUPID.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">That principle means that all C structures are &quot;naked&quot;, they have no extra data at the front. C strings are null terminated, they don't have a length counter. This was the principle that allowed C to replace assembly.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Yeah, I think everyone agrees with you that this is good. I don't use C# because I don't use corporate products, nothing from corporate capitalism, sorry.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">It would be best if there was a good glue framework for heterogenous projects, in an extensible language, like LISP, but with a c-like syntax and underpinning, still with the LISP code as data idea. Julia was supposed to be that, but it's not THAT great. It could have been better.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Linus Torvalds says, it's good to restrict a group project to C, because then you avoid 99% of poor programmers. It's just a social trick, to make sure you get good people.</span></div><hr/><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">HAHAHAHAHA!! A conservatroid alt-right CRYBABY. HAHAHA. WAAAH! WAH!! Marxist hewt my feewings. HE SHEWED ME I'M STOOPID. I GUESS I AM STOOPID.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">HAHAHA. SUCK IT UP, RETARD.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">And don't feel too bad about being so stupid. It's not your fault, it's genetic.</span></div><ul><li><div><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">Socialists DO NOT believe that people are equal. Socialists believe that socialists are superior. That's why we are socialists. Since you are not a socialist, you are mentally deficient, inferior, pathetic, subhuman. You inspire pity. I want you to realize how subhuman you are, so perhaps you can improve.The path to improve is to read Karl Marx. Then sing the Internationale. Finally, take time to learn academic thought coming from Europa.American stuff is sometimes okay, but it was usually written by a subhuman, some non-socialist as moronic and inferior as you are. Notable exceptions are W.E.B. DuBois, Albert Einstein, Martin Luther King Jr., Cornel West, and most in academic hard science.</span></font></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">No man, it's you that is ignorant. You've been brainwashed by the fascists. It's hard to awaken from your slumber, but first, (((I))) have to (((tell))) you (((something))) about (((me))) which will make it (((difficult))) for you to (((listen))).</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">If the holocaust is fake, why is Europe Judenfrei? (((I))) (((don't))) (((think))) (((you))) (((understand))) (((something))), (((I))) (((AM))) (((A))) (((JEW))), (((IDIOT))). All but a handful of my European side of the family was murdered in Europe in 1944-1945, and I know by ASKING OTHER JEWS that 2/3 of all the Jews in Europe died, just by sampling, and the few that were left emigrated the hell out of Europe.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Once Europe had no more Jews, nothing changed. The communists stayed communists. The capitalists stayed capitalists. There were no more Jews in banking, they had fled. Didn't matter. There were no more Jews in German business, they were dead. Didn't matter. Nothing changed in Europe, and the world was still split.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">I am not worried about your threats. You need to grow up,</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">You are doing neither. You are deluding yourself and your friends with your drug-induced hallucinations. You are incapable of performing genocide on Jews, because it's already been done once, and you know the first law of history, no takebacks, no do-overs.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">Oh, they didn't tell you? I'm terminally ill! It's extremely contageous, it's a disease a person can only catch by fucking your mother.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">Although it is obvious from your homo-averse content that you much prefer your father, you caught it too, indirectly, through him, as he got infected while conceiving you. The disease does affect the development of the brain and spinal column, which he says explains how you turned out.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Yeah, socialism for the lolz. &quot;Stalin will build your industry from scratch&quot;, &quot;Lyudmilla Pavlichenko will pop a cap in your ass.&quot; &quot;Vive la commune!&quot;, &quot;YOU SHALL NOT PASS!&quot;</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">It's better than the DISHONESTY that buried Marx's contribution to Keyensian idea for a hundred years you ape. Because of retarded capitalists like you, the Marxian underpinnings of economics were denied and obfuscated, until we got a second great depression. Keynesian economics is a derivative of Marxist economics, which just throws away the class aspects and substitutes bullshit.</span></div></li><li><div><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">No, Keynesianism is correct. That's the part that you are too stupid to understand. This is not a debated point in economics departments anymore.</span></font></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">When you multiply the money supply by a factor of 3, like in the US in 2009, pre-Keyensian predictions, and Chicago school, predict PRICES TRIPLE. Keynes predicts no inflation. The result? No inflation beyond the normal few percent. The same in Russia in 1996, when the money supply was multiplied by something like 5. Prediction was hyperinflation, but nothing happened. This happens every time.</span></font></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">When you raise minimum wage, Chicago school and pre-Keynesian predictions were that some low-wage people will lose their jobs. This is so intuitive, in fact, it is something right-wingers keep telling the public-- raise the minimum wage and unemployment goes up.</span></font></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">This is entirely false, as a hundred years of experience with minimum wage shows. When you slowly raise minimum wage, gradually, over a year or two, say to $1,000,000/hr (some absurd value), what happens AT FIRST Is that unemployment goes DOWN.</span></font></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">Once unemployment reaches a minimum value. Then inflation goes UP, and further increases in minimum wage are worthless, they produce an equal inflation that eats up the value. That's because we don't pay people in gold, and banks will produce the money required by lending to people who have trouble making payroll, and the extra business compensates for the increased minimum wage.</span></font></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">Keyensian theory is based on the NONEQUILIBRIUM parts of the capitalist system, which is WAGES and COMPENSATION. Marx identified the reason that these are out of whack, and that's because of the class structure.</span></font></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">Keynes accepted that they are out of whack, and made up non-Marxist incorrect reasons why this should be so. He then adopted the Marxist prescriptions, without the correct Marxist theory. This causes a sickness in the field of economics, and causes morons llike you who don't know anything to question Keynesian prescriptions.</span></font></div><ul><li><div><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">I AGREE WITH YOU about the effect of money injections. But I wasn't talking about OUGHT. I was talking about IS. The point is that these money injections reveal a lot about the mechanism in a capitalist economy, and tell you which economic theory is right.</span></font></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">Keynes MADE UP that wage stickiness as a BULLSHIT EXCUSE to explain why he is doing manipulations. It ISN'T TRUE. Wage stickiness exists, to a small degree, but it is NOT why the equilibrium is broken.</span></font></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">The way you can tell is because lowering real wages makes a depression WORSE, not BETTER.</span></font></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">You see, Keynes understood the following things:</span></font></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">1. Marx is right.</span></font></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">2. I am not allowed to say this in academic journals.</span></font></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">3. That will never change, because those capitalists have got us by the balls.</span></font></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">4. The Leninist communists are arguably even worse than the capitalists.</span></font></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">So in order to get Marx into the journals he had to MAKE UP NONSENSE REASONS for non-equilibrium behavior. His GENIUS was making up bullshit excuses for straightforward Marxist phenomenon, and then offering correct Marxist prescriptions.</span></font></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">The phenomenon are REAL. his reasons are BULLSHIT. And he knew they were bullshit, that's why he privately hired Marxists.</span></font></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">Much much later, in the 80s, a bunch of economists who had totally forgotten the Marxist underpinnings looked at all the Keynes stuff and said &quot;What the fuck? This is all bullshit! How could this stuff work?&quot;</span></font></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">That's because it's based on much older stuff that isn't bullshit.</span></font></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">Not &quot;in disguise&quot;, in PLAGIARISM. He wasn't a Marxist, he was STEALING MARX'S IDEAS for his own career advancement. Still, all of Keynes' predictions WORK, because Marx's model is correct. And the microeconomic Chicago school predictions DON'T WORK. Because they are mentally retarded. That's the part you miss, you goddamn idiot.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">Please don't pontificate about things you are too ignorant to understand.</span></div><ul><li><div><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><br/></font></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">#</span></div></li></ul><hr/><ul><li><div><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sci.physics/KZAWsDTpt7E/R6Wga5_Bd8cJ" style="font-size: 8pt;">If I was god, I'd send all the atheists to heaven, just to piss the believers off</a></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Shut the fuck up, retard.

Actually, more pity, not a lot of love.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">There is only one side, you goddamn moron. The CO2 in the air is the complete answer to the question &quot;how hot is the air&quot;. The ice-ages happen over thousands and thousands of years, and you can ignore them, you stupid monkey.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;Previous ice-ages&quot; happen over HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS, you brain-damaged imbecile. They can be caused by the same processes of CO2 release/absorption, ONLY SLOWER. When CO2 absorption/release happens quickly, like, say, over about 100 years, then the result is CATSTROPHIC EXTINCTION. That's what we're doing. Releasing CO2 quickly. The CO2 in the air is the only thing determining the average temperature of the Earth, you drooling neanderthal, and the CO2 is what we emit when we burn carbon fuel, like gasoline, or coal, or natural gas. THERE ARE NO VARIATIONS IN AVERAGE TEMPERATURE ON ANY HUMAN TIMESCALE, EXCEPT AS CAUSED BY HUMAN CO2. Every scientist knows this since adolescence, retarded monkey. You don't, because you were dropped on your head as a child.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The other variations in climate, also in the range of 100,000 to a million years, is due to slow secular variations in the orbit of the Earth. Those cycles are so slow, they can be ignored when you are looking at decade to decade things.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">But actually, you probably do know all this. You just say otherwise because some oil billionaire wants to destroy the world, because, why the fuck should he care? He'll die soon. He doesn't believe in God or humanity, just in being rich. And you're doing his bidding. So you're not as much of an idiot as you appear to be. You know where your bread is buttered. Fucker.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is renewable, STUPID FUCK, because there is no burning of oil for energy. You could use petroleum for lubrication for a MILLION YEARS for all the wind-turbines to power the entire Earth, and it will have ZERO IMPACT and the oil will be simply be turned into old oil. Further, all the chemistry for lubrication can be equally easily be done using plant oils.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">You're just a worthless piece of shit selling out humanity for your own personal gain.

While we're on our way, excuse me if I take the time to spit in your face.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">There is nothing wrong with turbines for energy they don't emit CO2 except in manufacture, and the manufacture emissions are small enough for the Earth to deal with.

The CO2 in the air reflects infrared light, which makes the Earth warm up. The CO2 together with H2O (water) going in and out of oceans are the ONLY THING that matter for the temperature of the Earth. Since the water goes in and out of oceans, the only stable thing is CO2.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The CO2 is going up due to our emissions. Our emissions and deforestation is responsible for the exact amount that it is going up. The amount is such that each decade, we will heat up be a degree. That pace of change is too fast for life to adjust, so life will go extinct. There will be drought, and there will be famine. But not everywhere.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">By denying the science, because of your FEELINGS, you are helping this process along.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">I am a trained physicist. I have 100% knowledge on the issue, I know the warming mechanism, it is obvious and over 100 years old, and there is no doubts at all about the science. You are either a paid or unwitting propagandist working overtime to kill your own children. Think about it. What does that mean about you? Can you look at yourself in the mirror? Even if you're doing it out of stupidity, it is your job to remediate your stupidity and be certain before posting, not just go with your gut-feelings, but learn the actual science. If you are doing it and you know better, God have mercy on your soul.</span></div></li></ul><div><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><br/></font></div><div><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><br/></font></div><hr/><div><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><br/></font></div><div><font style="font-size: 8pt;"><br/></font></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(((I))) (((AM))) (((A))) (((JEW))), I can explain it!</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">You see, in capitalism, there are a few people who own factories, industries, and they are very powerful. There are very many people who are poor, and work for a barely sufficient paycheck. The people who are poor have politicians that represent them called 'socialists'. The people who are rich have politicians that represent THEM, those are called 'Republicans', and sometimes 'Democrats'.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Eventually, the poor people catch on, and start to vote for the candidates that actually represent them. Because the capitalists are OUTNUMBERED, they always need tricks to get people to vote for their guys.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The tricks are to focus on things that politicians can't change, like abortion, gun rights, brown people existing, gay marriage, constitutional things. Then say 'the opposition supports abortion'. The people who have moral objections will then vote based on disgust and moral outrage. The people who don't like brown people will vote based on racism. Then the politician gets in, lowers the wealthy person's taxes, starts some wars to help the business, and that's it. They've done their job. They won't ever outlaw abortion, then the wedge issue will start to work for the other side.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">But this method STOPPED WORKING in the recent past because voters no longer respond. Because they are really suffering economically now, because all the money has gone to the wealthiest, and people are being left to die without health care.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">When that stops working, the wealthy move on to much stronger stuff. They begin to DEMONIZE the other side, to say THEY ARE PEDOPHILES, they are RAPISTS. They MURDER WITH IMPUNITY.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">But, that's hard to do! People know Democrats, they know Socialists, they know they are normal people. So what does the capitalist say: they have been brainwashed and corrupted.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">By who?</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">THERE'S THE JEW!</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Jew brainwashed the bad capitalists to be bad. The Jew became a capitalist himself, sometimes.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The good capitalists are conservative white people, and they are on your side, as a poor white person. They will TAKE CARE of you. They will LOVE YOU. They are the good billionaires</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Jew ALSO brainwashed the socialists, by spreading socialism, saying &quot;All the billionaires WORK TOGETHER against your interest!&quot;</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Doesn't the Jew know that the GOOD WHITE BILLIONAIRE would NEVER steal pensions and benefits from HARD WORKING WHITE AMERICANS and stuff the money in his pocket? BAD JEW!</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Once the Jew pits socialist against capitalist, the JEW WINS! Because the Jew is at the head of both systems!</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The solution?</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Get rid of the Jews!</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Form a WHITE NATION. Let the WHITE BILLIONAIRE treat the WHITE PAUPER with love and compassion, like the White British billionaire treated the White Irish pauper during the potato famine. They loved them and gave them so much food, that the Irish gained a lot of weight during the famine. They didn't starve and flee for America.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">This story is harder to sell in China or Vietnam. It is also hard to sell in Europe past 1945, because THERE ARE NO MORE JEWS IN EUROPE. Because Hitler took this shit seriously, and murdered nearly all of them, and the few left fled.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">So in Europe, you just substitute &quot;Muslims&quot; for Jews, and when you need a mastermind, say &quot;The Jews are controlling the Muslims&quot;. It is helped by the fact that Jews outside of Israel have a strong tradition of ETHICS and OPPOSITION TO RACISM, so that many civil rights activists are Jewish, and whenever you see a Jew (like me) on the internet, they are anti-racist.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Yes, there's more to it if you dig deeper. (((I))) (((can))) (((keep))) (((explaining))).</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">You see, &quot;the Jew&quot; isn't some random chance selection. The Jew wasn't plucked from thin air. The REASON the Jew is the villain in this story is because of the circumstances of the enlightenment.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">During the middle ages, there was a religious order in the world. A king would have to be authorized by a Pope. If the king tried to enslave people, the Pope would object. The religious order replaced a cut-throat slave-capitalism which existed during the Roman empire.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Roman empire came from the Roman Republic, which is what the US constitution is modeled on (with some extra enlightenment stuff which is the bill of rights). The Roman Republic had a senate and consuls, and they represented the will of a collection of MEGA-WEALTHY OLIGARCHS who owned ENORMOUS SLAVE ESTATES. There was an oligarch who controlled water-powered wheat-mills, another oligarch who controlled slave-mines for iron. Another who controlled vast agriculture. These people dominated the senate. The people had pretend-representation, but really, they had no say.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Roman Republic turned into an empire after the citizens revolted and supported a populist who promised reform. That was Julius Caesar. The representatives of the republic murdered Caesar, and from the ensuing civil war came the Roman Empire and centuries of steady decline.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">During this decline, St. Paul explained the principles of Christianity. The Christian religion gave people spiritual comfort and hope, as they watched their world disintegrate. People were tortured in arenas, Christianity is about a tortured martyr. People were under the jackboot of slaveowners, Christianity appealed directly to slaves.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The result was that Christians took over Europe, Muslims took over the Middle East, slavery was effectively abolished, and a new economy took root, in which nobody got TOO wealthy. The merchant economy of the middle ages had millions of independent farmers and small businessmen exchanging goods, and it slowly allowed Europe to recover until it surpassed Rome in the 15th century. Except this time, no slaves. No gladiators. No mass torture. This was the Feudal time.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In 1492, this changed. America was discovered. Jews started doing banking, and Christians weren't allowed to do banking as Muslims still aren't. So Martin Luther (anti-jewish theologian) and Calvin (a banker) decided to overthrow the Catholic Church. The same with Henry VIII in England. The first decree once the Church was overthrown in all the countries was &quot;usury is legal now for Christians&quot;. The second decree usually banished the Jews.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Now those countries which legalized usury had Christian banking, and a person could GET A LOAN, GO TO MALI AND BUY SLAVES, GO TO AMERICA, KILL SOME INDIANS AND START A PLANTATION. That was the way you got rich, on rinse-repeat, for more than a hundred years.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Those new plantation produced the first SUPER RICH since the fall of the Roman empire, the first BIG BUSINESS. They had cotton and sugar plantations, enormous estates. And they missed the Roman way. The British set up colonial companies, and charters, to deal with the new mega-power structures of big business. ...</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">...</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">People in Europe began to rediscover Pagan stuff, art began to look Roman (Michaelangelo) and writing to look Pagan (like Shakespeare). Milton wrote &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; to describe the revolt against Christianity which his time was experiencing, as people went to the new world to escape the confines of Christian order.</span></div></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">And the new powerful capitalists said to themselves &quot;What was wrong with Roman Empire? They had people who knew their place! They had the poor. They had the rich. And when the rich wanted to get his cock sucked, all he needed to do was grab a slave. They knew that the slave loved sucking that wealthy man's cock. And when they wanted entertainment, they just had two poor people beat the shit out of each other in the ring. To the death. We can do that too.&quot;</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">So the wealthy began to worship the Roman empire, with it's inequality, and they considered themselves the HEIRS OF THE ROMAN ARISTOCRATS. And this worship reached it's zenith in America in the mid 19th century, when all the Roman-monuments went up.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In Europe, Nietzsche also discovered Rome, and LOVED IT! Inequality! Slavery! Torture! Sex crimes! LOVE IT!</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">But then, Nietzsche asks, why Christianity? Was Christianity a MISTAKE?</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">If it was a mistake, who is to blame?</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">-- Wait... wasn't St. Paul ... a Jew? We need to prevent that challenge to our power again.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Sir, it seems there's a guy named Karl Marx who just wrote a book about people being equal and stuff.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">-- Wait... wasn't he.... a Jew?</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Sort of, half, and his father converted.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">-- AH! So It's GENETIC! I knew it. Their drive for HUMAN EQUALITY AND JUSTICE stays in their blood EVEN after they convert!</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">But the populus is Christian, they don't agree with us about all this 'we are better than you' shit. They like justice and equality.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">-- Tell them Jews eat babies, are pedophiles, murder Christians, and are responsible for capitalism, for us. I mean, didn't they do banking before Christians did? Tell them they are responsible for socialism too. Once they are gone, there won't ever be another St. Paul or Karl Marx ever again.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">How do I say that?</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">-- Write &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; and spread it!</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">YES SIR!</span></div><hr/><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">You were taught incorrect science. The correct theory was discovered by Kudryavtsev in the Soviet Union. Oil is formed from methane at mantle pressure, and it percolates from the mantle back up, flowing along with the pressurized methane. This theory went through the grinder, and was confirmed and established by the 1970s, but in the West, capitalists continued to lie, because of the force of tradition, and capitalists don't care about scientific truth.</span></div></li></ul><hr/><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">climate politics</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">No, in 2028 the arctic will be ice-free, most of the coral will be dead, the ocean plankton will be reduced by 80%, and fish stocks will collapse. We’ll still have farming, but there will be famines here and there. It’s just that we won’t be able to do anything to avert the catastrophe in 2050, and the worse catastrophe in 2080, and the calamity in 2100, and the apocalypse in 2200. That’s why you need to act early.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">No, you really are doing the worst sort of evil right now. Please correct your path before you damn yourself. I am not kidding. If you are not paid by a billionaire, if you are sincerely not aware, just learn the science, it takes a few hours at worst.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Spreading propaganda against climate action is doing the bidding of billionaire elites. There are enough paid people doing that, don't help them. If you are one of the paid ones, obviously I can't reach you. If you are being paid to lie, then you already know you are lying, and you are already damned.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">There is no doubt that human CO2 causes global warming, there hasn't been for decades. It's obvious to any physicist. Really.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Propaganda? I am a single individual speaking for myself. I am looking at the content ratio for sincere comments, and it is half paid speech, paid memes, with the other half sincere people who are not very good at writing or meming.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">you can tell the difference because when a real person is writing, they either keep it short, or they have real information to convey.</span></div></li></ul></div><div><hr/><div><a href="https://wcipeg.com/wiki/User:Brian/Ron_Maimon_quotes" style="font-size: 8pt;">https://wcipeg.com/wiki/User:Brian/Ron_Maimon_quotes</a></div><ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 1.6em; padding: 0px; list-style-image: url(&quot;data; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><li style="margin-bottom: 0.1em;"><div><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">Ok, maybe she exists, maybe you are a LYING SHILL.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> We can't know now, can we?
