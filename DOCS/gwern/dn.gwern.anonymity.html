	<blockquote>
	<p>In the manga <em>Death Note</em>, the pro&shy;tag&shy;o&shy;nist Light Yagami is given the su&shy;per&shy;nat&shy;ural weapon “Death Note” which can kill any&shy;one on de&shy;mand, and be&shy;gins us&shy;ing it to re&shy;shape the world. The ge&shy;nius de&shy;tec&shy;tive L at&shy;tempts to track him down with analy&shy;sis and trick&shy;ery, and ul&shy;ti&shy;mately suc&shy;ceeds. <em>Death Note</em> is al&shy;most a thought-ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;men&shy;t-given the per&shy;fect mur&shy;der weapon, how can you screw up any&shy;way? I con&shy;sider the var&shy;i&shy;ous steps of L’s process from the per&shy;spec&shy;tive of com&shy;puter se&shy;cu&shy;ri&shy;ty, cryp&shy;tog&shy;ra&shy;phy, and in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion the&shy;o&shy;ry, to quan&shy;tify Light’s ini&shy;tial anonymity and how L grad&shy;u&shy;ally de-anonymizes him, and con&shy;sider which mis&shy;take was the largest as fol&shy;lows:</p>
	<ol type="1">
	<li><p>Light’s fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;tal mis&shy;take is to kill in ways un&shy;re&shy;lated to his goal.</p>
	<p>Killing through heart at&shy;tacks does not just make him vis&shy;i&shy;ble early on, but the deaths re&shy;veals that his as&shy;sas&shy;si&shy;na&shy;tion method is im&shy;pos&shy;si&shy;bly pre&shy;cise and some&shy;thing pro&shy;foundly anom&shy;alous is go&shy;ing on. L has been tipped off that Kira ex&shy;ists. What&shy;ever the bo&shy;gus jus&shy;ti&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion may be, this is a ma&shy;jor vic&shy;tory for his op&shy;po&shy;nents. (To de&shy;ter crim&shy;i&shy;nals and vil&shy;lains, it is not nec&shy;es&shy;sary for there to be a glob&shy;al&shy;ly-known sin&shy;gle anom&shy;alous or su&shy;per&shy;nat&shy;ural killer, when it would be equally effec&shy;tive to arrange for all the killings to be done nat&shy;u&shy;ral&shy;is&shy;ti&shy;cally by or&shy;di&shy;nary mech&shy;a&shy;nisms such as third par&shy;ties/<wbr>po&shy;lice/<wbr>ju&shy;di&shy;ciary or used in&shy;di&shy;rectly as par&shy;al&shy;lel con&shy;struc&shy;tion to crack cas&shy;es.)</p></li>
	<li><p>Worse, the deaths are non-ran&shy;dom in other ways—they tend to oc&shy;cur at par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar times!</p>
	<p>Just the sched&shy;ul&shy;ing of deaths cost Light 6 bits of anonymity</p></li>
	<li><p>Light’s third mis&shy;take was re&shy;act&shy;ing to the bla&shy;tant provo&shy;ca&shy;tion of Lind L. Tai&shy;lor.</p></li>
	</ol>
	<p>Tak&shy;ing the bait let L nar&shy;row his tar&shy;get down to 1⁄3 the orig&shy;i&shy;nal Japan&shy;ese pop&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion, for a gain of ~1.6 bits. 4. Light’s fourth mis&shy;take was to use con&shy;fi&shy;den&shy;tial po&shy;lice in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion stolen us&shy;ing his po&shy;lice&shy;man fa&shy;ther’s cre&shy;den&shy;tials.</p>
	<p>This mis&shy;take was the largest in bits lost. This mis&shy;take cost him 11 bits of anonymi&shy;ty; in other words, this mis&shy;take cost him twice what his sched&shy;ul&shy;ing cost him and al&shy;most 8 times the mur&shy;der of Tai&shy;lor! 5. Killing Ray Pen&shy;bar and the <span class="smallcaps-auto">FBI</span> team.</p>
	<p>If we as&shy;sume Pen&shy;bar was tasked 200 leads out of the 10,000, then mur&shy;der&shy;ing him and the fi&shy;ancee dropped Light just 6 bits or a lit&shy;tle over half the fourth mis&shy;take and com&shy;pa&shy;ra&shy;ble to the orig&shy;i&shy;nal sched&shy;ul&shy;ing mis&shy;take. 6. Endgame: At this point in the plot, L re&shy;sorts to di&shy;rect mea&shy;sures and en&shy;ters Light’s life di&shy;rect&shy;ly, en&shy;rolling at the uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty, with Light un&shy;able to per&shy;fectly play the role of in&shy;no&shy;cent un&shy;der in&shy;tense in&shy;-per&shy;son sur&shy;veil&shy;lance.</p>
	<p>From that point on, Light is screwed as he is now play&shy;ing a deadly game of “Mafia” with L &amp; the in&shy;ves&shy;tiga&shy;tive team. He frit&shy;tered away &gt;25 bits of anonymity and then L in&shy;tu&shy;ited the rest and sus&shy;pected him all along.</p>
	<p>Fi&shy;nal&shy;ly, I sug&shy;gest how Light could have most effec&shy;tively em&shy;ployed the Death Note and lim&shy;ited his loss of anonymi&shy;ty. In an ap&shy;pen&shy;dix, I dis&shy;cuss the max&shy;i&shy;mum amount of in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion leak&shy;age pos&shy;si&shy;ble from us&shy;ing a Death Note as a com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion de&shy;vice.</p>

	<h3>DETECTIVE STORIES AS OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS</h3>
	<p>In Light’s case, L starts with the world’s en&shy;tire pop&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion of 7 bil&shy;lion peo&shy;ple and needs to nar&shy;row it down to 1 per&shy;son. It’s a search prob&shy;lem. It maps fairly di&shy;rectly onto ba&shy;sic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion the&shy;ory</a>⁠, in fact. (See also <a href="/Simulation-inferences" id="gwern-simulation-inferences" class="link-local docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">Sim&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion in&shy;fer&shy;ences</a>⁠, <a href="/The-3-Grenades" id="gwern-the-3-grenades" class="link-local docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">The 3 Grenades</a>⁠, and for case stud&shy;ies in ap&shy;plied deanonymiza&shy;tion, <a href="/DNM-arrests" id="gwern-dnm-arrests" class="link-local docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">Tor <span class="smallcaps-auto">DNM</span>-related ar&shy;rests, 2011–2015</a>⁠.) To uniquely spec&shy;ify one item out of 7 bil&shy;lion, you need 33 bits of in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion be&shy;cause $\log_2(7000000000) \approx 32.7$; to use an anal&shy;o&shy;gy, your 32-bit com&shy;puter can only ad&shy;dress one unique lo&shy;ca&shy;tion in mem&shy;ory out of <em>4</em> bil&shy;lion lo&shy;ca&shy;tions, and adding an&shy;other bit dou&shy;bles the ca&shy;pac&shy;ity to &gt;8 bil&shy;lion. Is 33 bits of in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion a lot?</p>
	<p>Not re&shy;al&shy;ly. L could get one bit just by look&shy;ing at his&shy;tory or crime sta&shy;tis&shy;tics, and not&shy;ing that mass mur&shy;der&shy;ers are, to an as&shy;ton&shy;ish&shy;ing de&shy;gree, <em>male</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref spawns-popup" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>⁠, thereby rul&shy;ing out half the world pop&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion and ac&shy;tu&shy;ally start&shy;ing L off with a re&shy;quire&shy;ment to ob&shy;tain only 32 bits to break Light’s anonymi&shy;ty.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref spawns-popup" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> If Death Note users were suffi&shy;ciently ra&shy;tio&shy;nal &amp; knowl&shy;edge&shy;able, they could draw on con&shy;cepts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superrationality" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">su&shy;per&shy;ra&shy;tional&shy;ity</a> to acausally co&shy;op&shy;er&shy;ate<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref spawns-popup" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> to avoid this in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion leak&shy;age… by ar&shy;rang&shy;ing to pass on Death Notes to fe&shy;males<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref spawns-popup" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> to re&shy;store a 50:50 gen&shy;der ra&shy;tio—&shy;for ex&shy;am&shy;ple, if for every fe&shy;male who ob&shy;tained a Death note there were 3 males with Death Notes, then all users could roll a 1d3 dice and if 1 keep it and if 2 or 3 pass it on to some&shy;one of the op&shy;po&shy;site gen&shy;der.</p>
	<p>We should first point out that Light is al&shy;ways go&shy;ing to leak <em>some</em> bits. The only way he could re&shy;main per&shy;fectly hid&shy;den is to not use the Death Note at all. If you change the world in even the slight&shy;est way, then you have leaked in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion about your&shy;self in prin&shy;ci&shy;ple. Every&shy;thing is con&shy;nected in some sense; you can&shy;not mag&shy;i&shy;cally wave away the ex&shy;is&shy;tence of fire with&shy;out cre&shy;at&shy;ing a cas&shy;cade of con&shy;se&shy;quences that re&shy;sult in <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/hq/universal_fire/" class="has-content spawns-popup">every liv&shy;ing thing dy&shy;ing</a>⁠. For ex&shy;am&shy;ple, the fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;tal point of Light ex&shy;e&shy;cut&shy;ing crim&shy;i&shy;nals is to <em>shorten their lifes&shy;pan</em>—there’s no way to hide that. You can’t both shorten their lives and <em>not</em> shorten their lives. He is go&shy;ing to re&shy;veal him&shy;self this way, at the least, to the ac&shy;tu&shy;ar&shy;ies and sta&shy;tis&shy;ti&shy;cians.</p>
	<p>More his&shy;tor&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly, this has been a chal&shy;lenge for cryp&shy;tog&shy;ra&shy;phers, like in <span class="smallcaps-auto">WWII</span>: how did they ex&shy;ploit the Enigma &amp; other com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tions with&shy;out re&shy;veal&shy;ing they had done so? Their so&shy;lu&shy;tion was mis&shy;di&shy;rec&shy;tion: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra#Safeguarding_of_sources" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">con&shy;stantly ar&shy;rang&shy;ing for plau&shy;si&shy;ble al&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tives</a>⁠, like search planes that ‘just hap&shy;pened’ to find Ger&shy;man sub&shy;marines or leaks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-Cross_System" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">con&shy;trolled known Ger&shy;man agents</a> about there be&shy;ing undis&shy;cov&shy;ered spies. (How&shy;ev&shy;er, the fa&shy;mous story that Win&shy;ston Churchill al&shy;lowed the town of Coven&shy;try to be bombed rather than risk the se&shy;cret of Ul&shy;tra has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry_Blitz#Coventry_and_Ultra" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">since been put into ques&shy;tion</a>⁠.) This worked in part be&shy;cause of Ger&shy;man over&shy;con&shy;fi&shy;dence, be&shy;cause the war did not last too long, and in part be&shy;cause each cover story was plau&shy;si&shy;ble on its own and no one was, in the chaos of war, able to see the whole pic&shy;ture and re&shy;al&shy;ize that there were <em>too</em> many lucky search planes and too many undis&shy;cov&shy;er&shy;able moles; even&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly, how&shy;ev&shy;er, some&shy;one would re&shy;al&shy;ize, and ap&shy;par&shy;ently some Ger&shy;mans did con&shy;clude that Enigma had to have been bro&shy;ken (but much too late). It’s not clear to me what would be the best mis&shy;di&shy;rec&shy;tion for Light to mask his nor&shy;mal killings—use the Death Note’s con&shy;trol fea&shy;tures to in&shy;vent a an&shy;ti-crim&shy;i&shy;nal ter&shy;ror&shy;ist or&shy;ga&shy;ni&shy;za&shy;tion?</p>
	<p>So there is a real chal&shy;lenge here: one party is try&shy;ing to in&shy;fer as much as pos&shy;si&shy;ble from ob&shy;served effects, and the other is try&shy;ing to min&shy;i&shy;mize how much the for&shy;mer can ob&shy;serve while not stop&shy;ping en&shy;tire&shy;ly. How well does Light bal&shy;ance the com&shy;pet&shy;ing de&shy;mands?</p>
	
	<h3>MISTAKE 1</h3>
	<p>How&shy;ev&shy;er, he can try to re&shy;duce the leak&shy;age and make his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_anonymity" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">anonymity set</a> as large as pos&shy;si&shy;ble. For ex&shy;am&shy;ple, killing every crim&shy;i&shy;nal with a heart at&shy;tack is a dead give-away. Crim&shy;i&shy;nals do not die of heart at&shy;tacks that often. (The point is more dra&shy;matic if you re&shy;place ‘heart at&shy;tack’ with ‘lu&shy;pus’; as we all know, in real life it’s never lu&shy;pus.) Heart at&shy;tacks are a sub&shy;set of all deaths, and by re&shy;strict&shy;ing him&shy;self, Light makes it eas&shy;ier to de&shy;tect his ac&shy;tiv&shy;i&shy;ties. 1000 deaths of lu&shy;pus are a blar&shy;ing red alarm; 1000 deaths of heart at&shy;tacks are an odd&shy;i&shy;ty; and 1000 deaths dis&shy;trib&shy;uted over the sta&shy;tis&shy;ti&shy;cally likely sus&shy;pects of can&shy;cer and heart dis&shy;ease etc. are al&shy;most in&shy;vis&shy;i&shy;ble (but still no&shy;tice&shy;able in prin&shy;ci&shy;ple).</p>
	<p>So, Light’s fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;tal mis&shy;take is to kill in ways un&shy;re&shy;lated to his goal. Killing through heart at&shy;tacks does not just make him vis&shy;i&shy;ble early on, but the deaths re&shy;veals that his as&shy;sas&shy;si&shy;na&shy;tion method is su&shy;per&shy;nat&shy;u&shy;rally pre&shy;cise. L has been tipped off that Kira ex&shy;ists. What&shy;ever the bo&shy;gus jus&shy;ti&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion may be, this is a ma&shy;jor vic&shy;tory for his op&shy;po&shy;nents.</p>
	<p>First mis&shy;take, and a clas&shy;sic one of se&shy;r&shy;ial killers (eg the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Rader" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup"><span class="smallcaps-auto">BTK</span> killer</a>’s vaunt&shy;ing was less anony&shy;mous than he be&shy;lieved): delu&shy;sions of grandeur and the de&shy;sire to taunt, play with, and con&shy;trol their vic&shy;tims and demon&shy;strate their power over the gen&shy;eral pop&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion. From a lit&shy;er&shy;ary per&shy;spec&shy;tive, this sim&shy;i&shy;lar&shy;ity is clearly not an ac&shy;ci&shy;dent, as we are meant to read Light as the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" class="no-popup">So&shy;ciopath</a> <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero" class="no-popup">Hero</a> ar&shy;che&shy;type: his ul&shy;ti&shy;mate down&shy;fall is the con&shy;se&shy;quence of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamartia" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">fa&shy;tal per&shy;son&shy;al&shy;ity flaw</a>⁠, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">hubris</a>⁠, par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;larly in the orig&shy;i&shy;nal sadis&shy;tic sense. Light <em>can&shy;not</em> help but self&shy;-s&shy;ab&shy;o&shy;tage like this.</p>
	<p>(This is also deeply prob&shy;lem&shy;atic from the point of car&shy;ry&shy;ing out Light’s the&shy;ory of de&shy;ter&shy;rence: to de&shy;ter crim&shy;i&shy;nals and vil&shy;lains, it is not nec&shy;es&shy;sary for there to be a glob&shy;al&shy;ly-known sin&shy;gle su&shy;per&shy;nat&shy;ural killer, when it would be equally effec&shy;tive to arrange for all the killings to be done nat&shy;u&shy;ral&shy;is&shy;ti&shy;cally by third par&shy;ties/<wbr>po&shy;lice/<wbr>ju&shy;di&shy;ciary or used in&shy;di&shy;rectly to crack cas&shy;es. Ar&shy;guably the de&shy;ter&shy;rence would be more effec&shy;tive the more diffused it’s be&shy;lieved to be—s&shy;ince a sin&shy;gle killer has a fi&shy;nite lifes&shy;pan, fi&shy;nite knowl&shy;edge, fal&shy;li&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty, and idio&shy;syn&shy;cratic pref&shy;er&shy;ences which re&shy;duce the threat and con&shy;nec&shy;tion to crim&shy;i&shy;nal&shy;i&shy;ty, while if all the deaths were as&shy;cribed to un&shy;usu&shy;ally effec&shy;tive po&shy;lice or de&shy;tec&shy;tives, this would be in&shy;ferred as a gen&shy;eral in&shy;crease in all kinds of po&shy;lice com&shy;pe&shy;tence, one which will not in&shy;stantly dis&shy;ap&shy;pear when one per&shy;son gets bored or hit by a bus.)</p>
	
	<h3>MISTAKE 2</h3>
	<p>Worse, the deaths are non-ran&shy;dom in other ways—they tend to oc&shy;cur at par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar times! Graphed, daily pat&shy;terns jump out.</p>
	<p>L was able to nar&shy;row down the ac&shy;tive times of the pre&shy;sum&shy;able stu&shy;dent or worker to a par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar range of lon&shy;gi&shy;tude, say 125–150° out of 180°; and what coun&shy;try is most promi&shy;nent in that range? Japan. So that cut down the 7 bil&shy;lion peo&shy;ple to around 0.128 bil&shy;lion; 0.128 bil&shy;lion re&shy;quires 27 bits ($\log_2(128000000) \approx 26.93$) so just the sched&shy;ul&shy;ing of deaths cost Light 6 bits of anonymi&shy;ty!</p>

	<h4>De-Anonymization</h4>
	<p>On a side-note, some might be skep&shy;ti&shy;cal that one can in&shy;fer much of any&shy;thing from the graph and that <em>Death Note</em> was just gloss&shy;ing over this part. “How can any&shy;one in&shy;fer that it was some&shy;one liv&shy;ing in Japan just from 2 clumpy lines at morn&shy;ing and evening in Japan?” But ac&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly, such a graph is sur&shy;pris&shy;ingly pre&shy;cise. I learned this years be&shy;fore I watched <em>Death Note</em>, when I was heav&shy;ily ac&shy;tive on Wikipedia; often I would won&shy;der if two ed&shy;i&shy;tors were the same per&shy;son or roughly where an ed&shy;i&shy;tor lived. What I would do if their ed&shy;its or user page did not re&shy;veal any&shy;thing use&shy;ful is I would go to “Kate’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AWikiProject_edit_counters" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">edit counter</a>” and I would ex&shy;am&shy;ine the times of day all their hun&shy;dreds or thou&shy;sands of ed&shy;its were made at. Typ&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly, what one would see was ~4 hours where there were no ed&shy;its what&shy;so&shy;ev&shy;er, then ~4 hours with mod&shy;er&shy;ate to high ac&shy;tiv&shy;i&shy;ty, a trough, then an&shy;other grad&shy;ual rise to 8 hours later and a fur&shy;ther de&shy;cline down to the first 4 hours of no ac&shy;tiv&shy;i&shy;ty. These pe&shy;ri&shy;ods quite clearly cor&shy;re&shy;sponded to sleep (pretty much every&shy;one is asleep at 4 <span class="smallcaps-auto">AM</span>), morn&shy;ing, lunch &amp; work hours, evening, and then night with peo&shy;ple oc&shy;ca&shy;sion&shy;ally stay&shy;ing up late and edit&shy;ing<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref spawns-popup" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>⁠. There was noise, of course, from peo&shy;ple stay&shy;ing up es&shy;pe&shy;cially late or get&shy;ting in a bunch of edit&shy;ing dur&shy;ing their work&shy;day or oc&shy;ca&shy;sion&shy;ally trav&shy;el&shy;ing, but the over&shy;all pat&shy;terns were clear—n&shy;ever did I dis&shy;cover that some&shy;one was ac&shy;tu&shy;ally a night&shy;watch&shy;man and my guess was an en&shy;tire hemi&shy;sphere off.

	<h3>MISTAKE 3</h3>
	<p>Light’s third mis&shy;take was re&shy;act&shy;ing to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_trap" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">ca&shy;nary trap</a> provo&shy;ca&shy;tion of the Lind L. Tai&shy;lor broad&shy;cast, crit&shy;i&shy;ciz&shy;ing Ki&shy;ra, and Light lash&shy;ing out to use the clear&shy;ly-vis&shy;i&shy;ble name &amp; face to kill Lind L. Tai&shy;lor. The live broad&shy;cast was a bla&shy;tant at&shy;tempt to pro&shy;voke a re&shy;ac&shy;tion—any re&shy;ac&shy;tion—from a sur&shy;prised &amp; un&shy;pre&shy;pared Light, and that alone should have been suffi&shy;cient rea&shy;son to sim&shy;ply ig&shy;nore it (even if Light could not have rea&shy;son&shy;ably known ex&shy;actly <em>how</em> it was a trap): one should never do what an en&shy;emy wants one to do on ground &amp; terms &amp; tim&shy;ing pre&shy;pared by the en&shy;e&shy;my. (Light had the op&shy;tion to use the Death Note at any time in the fu&shy;ture, and that would have been al&shy;most as good a demon&shy;stra&shy;tion of his power as do&shy;ing so dur&shy;ing a live broad&shy;cast.)</p>
	<p>Run&shy;ning the broad&shy;cast in 1 re&shy;gion was also a gam&shy;ble &amp; a po&shy;ten&shy;tial mis&shy;take on L’s part; he had no real rea&shy;son to think Light was in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanto_region" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">Kanto</a> (or if he did al&shy;ready have pri&shy;ors/<wbr>in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion to that effect, he should’ve been bi&shy;sect&shy;ing Kan&shy;to) and should have arranged for it to be broad&shy;cast to ex&shy;actly half of Japan’s pop&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion, ob&shy;tain&shy;ing an ex&shy;pected max&shy;i&shy;mum of 1 bit. But it was one that paid off; he nar&shy;rowed his tar&shy;get down to 1⁄3 the orig&shy;i&shy;nal Japan&shy;ese pop&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion, for a gain of ~1.6 bits. (You can see it was a gam&shy;ble by con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;ing if Light had been out&shy;side Kan&shy;to; since he would not see it live, he would not have re&shy;act&shy;ed, and all L would learn is that his sus&shy;pect was in that other 2⁄3 of the pop&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion, for a gain of only ~0.3 bit&shy;s.)</p>
	<p>But even this was&shy;n’t a <em>huge</em> mis&shy;take. He lost 6 bits to his sched&shy;ule of killing, and lost an&shy;other 1.6 bits to tem&shy;pera&shy;men&shy;tally killing Lind L. Tai&shy;lor, but since the male pop&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion of Kanto is 21.5 mil&shy;lion (43 mil&shy;lion to&shy;tal), he still has ~24 bits of anonymity left (log<sub>2</sub> (21500000) ≈ 24.36). That’s not too ter&shy;ri&shy;ble, and the loss is mit&shy;i&shy;gated even fur&shy;ther by other de&shy;tails of this mis&shy;take, as pointed out by <a href="/docs/www/alternatehistory.com/42693d9754ba7468c9968fee5f0c95b59292b27b.html" class="localArchive has-content spawns-popup" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="http://alternatehistory.com/discussion/showpost.php?p=7751679&amp;postcount=10" data-attribute-title="How might the real world react to a real Kira (Death Note) (Original URL: http://alternatehistory.com/discussion/showpost.php?p=7751679&amp;postcount=10 )">Zm&shy;flav&shy;ius</a>⁠; specifi&shy;cal&shy;ly, that un&shy;like “be&shy;ing male” or “be&shy;ing Japan&shy;ese”, the in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion about be&shy;ing in Kanto is sub&shy;ject to <em>de&shy;cay</em>, since peo&shy;ple move around all the time for all sorts of rea&shy;sons:</p>
	<blockquote>
	<p>…quite pos&shy;si&shy;bly Light’s biggest mis&shy;take was in&shy;ad&shy;ver&shy;tently re&shy;veal&shy;ing his con&shy;nec&shy;tion to the po&shy;lice hi&shy;er&shy;ar&shy;chy by hack&shy;ing his dad’s com&shy;put&shy;er. Whereas even the Lind L. Tay&shy;lor de&shy;ba&shy;cle only re&shy;vealed his killing me&shy;chan&shy;ics and nar&shy;rowed him down to “some&shy;one in the Kanto re&shy;gion” (which is, while an im&shy;pres&shy;sive ac&shy;com&shy;plish&shy;ment based on the in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion he had, en&shy;tirely mean&shy;ing&shy;less for ac&shy;tu&shy;ally find&shy;ing a sus&shy;pec&shy;t), there were per&shy;haps a few hun&shy;dred peo&shy;ple who had ac&shy;cess to the in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion Light’s dad had. There’s also the fact that L <em>knew</em> that Light was prob&shy;a&shy;bly some&shy;one in their late teens, mean&shy;ing that there was an ex&shy;tremely high chance that at the end of the school year, even that coup of his would ex&shy;pire, thanks to stu&shy;dents head&shy;ing off to uni&shy;ver&shy;sity all over Japan (of course, Light went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tokyo" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">Toudai</a>⁠, and a stu&shy;dent of his cal&shy;iber not at&shy;tend&shy;ing such a uni&shy;ver&shy;sity would be sus&shy;pi&shy;cious, but L had no way of know&shy;ing that then). I mean, per&shy;haps L had hoped that Kira would re&shy;veal him&shy;self by sud&shy;denly mov&shy;ing away from the Kanto re&shy;gion, but come the next May, he would have no way of mon&shy;i&shy;tor&shy;ing un&shy;usual move&shy;ments among late teenagers, be&shy;cause a large per&shy;cent&shy;age of them would be mov&shy;ing for le&shy;git&shy;i&shy;mate rea&shy;sons.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>(One could still run the in&shy;fer&shy;ence “back&shy;wards” on any par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar per&shy;son to ver&shy;ify they were in Kanto in the right time pe&shy;ri&shy;od, but as time pass&shy;es, it be&shy;comes less pos&shy;si&shy;ble to run the in&shy;fer&shy;ence “for&shy;wards” and only ex&shy;am&shy;ine peo&shy;ple in Kan&shy;to.)</p>
	<p>This mis&shy;take also shows us that the im&shy;por&shy;tant thing that in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion the&shy;ory buys us, re&shy;al&shy;ly, is not the <em>bit</em> (we could be us&shy;ing log<sub>10</sub> rather than log<sub>2</sub>, and com&shy;pares <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_%28information%29" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">“dits”</a> rather than “bits”) so much as com&shy;par&shy;ing events in the plot on a <em>log&shy;a&shy;rith&shy;mic</em> scale. If we sim&shy;ply looked at how the ab&shy;solute num&shy;ber of how many peo&shy;ple were ruled out at each step, we’d con&shy;clude that the first mis&shy;take by Light was a de&shy;ba&shy;cle with&shy;out com&shy;pare since it let L rule out &gt;6 bil&shy;lion peo&shy;ple, ap&shy;prox&shy;i&shy;mately 60× more peo&shy;ple than all the other mis&shy;takes put to&shy;gether would let L rule out. Mis&shy;takes are rel&shy;a&shy;tive to each oth&shy;er, not ab&shy;solutes.</p>
	

	<h3>MISTAKE 4</h3>
	<p>Light’s fourth mis&shy;take was to use con&shy;fi&shy;den&shy;tial po&shy;lice in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion stolen us&shy;ing his po&shy;lice&shy;man fa&shy;ther’s cre&shy;den&shy;tials. This was un&shy;nec&shy;es&shy;sary as there are count&shy;less crim&shy;i&shy;nals he could still ex&shy;e&shy;cute us&shy;ing pub&shy;lic in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion (face+&shy;name is not typ&shy;i&shy;cally diffi&shy;cult to get), and if for some rea&shy;son he needed a spe&shy;cific crim&shy;i&shy;nal, he could ei&shy;ther re&shy;strict use of se&shy;cret in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion to a few high&shy;-pri&shy;or&shy;ity vic&shy;tim&shy;s—if only to avoid sus&shy;pi&shy;cions of hack&shy;ing &amp; sub&shy;se&shy;quent se&shy;cu&shy;rity up&shy;grades cost&shy;ing him ac&shy;cess!—or man&shy;u&shy;fac&shy;ture, us&shy;ing the Death Note’s co&shy;er&shy;cive pow&shy;ers or Ki&shy;ra’s pub&shy;lic sup&shy;port, a way to re&shy;lease in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion such as a ‘leak’ or pass&shy;ing pub&shy;lic trans&shy;parency laws.</p>
	<p>This mis&shy;take was the largest in bits lost. But in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing&shy;ly, many or even most <em>Death Note</em> fans do not seem to re&shy;gard this as his largest mis&shy;take, in&shy;stead point&shy;ing to his killing Lind L. Tai&shy;lor or per&shy;haps re&shy;ly&shy;ing too much on Mika&shy;mi. The in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion the&shy;o&shy;ret&shy;i&shy;cal per&shy;spec&shy;tive strongly dis&shy;agrees, and lets us quan&shy;tify how large this mis&shy;take was.</p>
	<p>When he acts on the se&shy;cret po&shy;lice in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion, he in&shy;stantly cuts down his pos&shy;si&shy;ble iden&shy;tity to one out of a few thou&shy;sand peo&shy;ple con&shy;nected to the po&shy;lice. Let’s be gen&shy;er&shy;ous and say 10,000. It takes 14 bits to spec&shy;ify 1 per&shy;son out of 10,000 (log<sub>2</sub> (10000) ≈ 13.29)—as com&shy;pared to the 24–25 bits to spec&shy;ify a Kanto dweller.</p>
	<p>This mis&shy;take cost him 11 bits of anonymi&shy;ty; in other words, this mis&shy;take cost him <em>twice</em> what his sched&shy;ul&shy;ing cost him and al&shy;most <em>8</em> times the mur&shy;der of Tai&shy;lor!</p>
	

	<h3>MISTAKE 5</h3>
	<p>In com&shy;par&shy;ison, the fifth mis&shy;take, mur&shy;der&shy;ing Ray Pen&shy;bar’s fi&shy;ancee and fo&shy;cus&shy;ing L’s sus&shy;pi&shy;cion on Pen&shy;bar’s as&shy;signed tar&shy;gets was pos&shy;i&shy;tively cheap. If we as&shy;sume Pen&shy;bar was tasked 200 leads out of the 10,000, then mur&shy;der&shy;ing him and the fi&shy;ancee dropped Light from 14 bits to 8 bits (log<sub>2</sub> (200) ≈ 7.64) or just 6 bits or a lit&shy;tle over half the fourth mis&shy;take and com&shy;pa&shy;ra&shy;ble to the orig&shy;i&shy;nal sched&shy;ul&shy;ing mis&shy;take.</p>


	<h3>ENDGAME</h3>
	<p>At this point in the plot, L re&shy;sorts to di&shy;rect mea&shy;sures and en&shy;ters Light’s life di&shy;rect&shy;ly, en&shy;rolling at the uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty. From this point on, Light is screwed as he is now play&shy;ing a deadly game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_%28party_game%29" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">Mafia</a> with L &amp; the in&shy;ves&shy;tiga&shy;tive team. He frit&shy;tered away &gt;25 bits of anonymity and then L in&shy;tu&shy;ited the rest and sus&shy;pected him all along. (We could jus&shy;tify L skip&shy;ping over the re&shy;main&shy;ing 8 bits by point&shy;ing out that L can an&shy;a&shy;lyze the deaths and in&shy;fer psy&shy;cho&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal char&shy;ac&shy;ter&shy;is&shy;tics like ar&shy;ro&shy;gance, puz&shy;zle-solv&shy;ing, and great in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gence, which com&shy;bined with heuris&shy;ti&shy;cally search&shy;ing the re&shy;main&shy;ing can&shy;di&shy;dates, could lead him to zero in on Light.)</p>
	<p>From the the&shy;o&shy;ret&shy;i&shy;cal point of view, the game was over at that point. The chal&shy;lenge for L then be&shy;came prov&shy;ing it to L’s sat&shy;is&shy;fac&shy;tion un&shy;der his self&shy;-im&shy;posed moral con&shy;straints.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref spawns-popup" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>


	<h3>SECURITY IS HARD (LET’S GO SHOPPING)</h3>
	<p>What <em>should</em> Light have done? That’s easy to an&shy;swer, but tricky to im&shy;ple&shy;ment.</p>
	<p>One could try to man&shy;u&shy;fac&shy;ture <em>dis</em>in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">Ter&shy;ence Tao</a> re&shy;hearses many of the above points about in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion the&shy;ory &amp; anonymi&shy;ty, and <a href="/docs/cs/2012-terencetao-anonymity.html" class="has-content spawns-popup" data-attribute-title="Original: plus.google.com/114134834346472219368/posts/8vmpA9fgRMq">goes on to loosely dis&shy;cuss</a> the pos&shy;si&shy;ble ben&shy;e&shy;fits of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">fak&shy;ing in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion</a>:</p>
	<blockquote>
	<p>…one ad&shy;di&shy;tional way to gain more anonymity is through de&shy;lib&shy;er&shy;ate <em>dis&shy;in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion</em>. For in&shy;stance, sup&shy;pose that one re&shy;veals 100 in&shy;de&shy;pen&shy;dent bits of in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion about one&shy;self. Or&shy;di&shy;nar&shy;i&shy;ly, this would cost 100 bits of anonymity (as&shy;sum&shy;ing that each bit was <em>a pri&shy;ori</em> equally likely to be true or false), by cut&shy;ting the num&shy;ber of pos&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ties down by a fac&shy;tor of 2<sup>100</sup>; but if 5 of these 100 bits (cho&shy;sen ran&shy;domly and not re&shy;vealed in ad&shy;vance) are de&shy;lib&shy;er&shy;ately fal&shy;si&shy;fied, then the num&shy;ber of pos&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ties in&shy;creases again by a fac&shy;tor of (100 <code>choose</code> 5) ~ 2<sup>26</sup>, re&shy;cov&shy;er&shy;ing about 26 bits of anonymi&shy;ty. In prac&shy;tice one gains even more anonymity than this, be&shy;cause to dis&shy;pel the dis&shy;in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion one needs to solve a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">sat&shy;is&shy;fi&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;ity</a> prob&shy;lem, which can be no&shy;to&shy;ri&shy;ously in&shy;tractable com&shy;pu&shy;ta&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ly, al&shy;though this ad&shy;di&shy;tional pro&shy;tec&shy;tion may dis&shy;si&shy;pate with time as al&shy;go&shy;rithms im&shy;prove (e.g. by in&shy;cor&shy;po&shy;rat&shy;ing ideas from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_sensing" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">com&shy;pressed sens&shy;ing</a>).</p>

	<h4>RANDOMIZING</h4>
	<p>The diffi&shy;culty with sug&shy;gest&shy;ing that Light should—or <em>could</em>—have used dis&shy;in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion on the tim&shy;ing of deaths is that we are, in effect, en&shy;gag&shy;ing in a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">hind&shy;sight bias</a>⁠. How ex&shy;actly is Light or any&shy;one sup&shy;posed to know that L could de&shy;duce his time&shy;zone from his killings? I men&shy;tioned an ex&shy;am&shy;ple of us&shy;ing Wikipedia ed&shy;its to lo&shy;cal&shy;ize ed&shy;i&shy;tors, but that tech&shy;nique was unique to me among WP ed&shy;i&shy;tors<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref spawns-popup" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> and no doubt there are many other forms of in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion leak&shy;age I have never heard of de&shy;spite com&shy;pil&shy;ing a list; if I were Light, even if I re&shy;mem&shy;bered my Wikipedia tech&shy;nique, I might not bother evenly dis&shy;trib&shy;ut&shy;ing my killing over the clock or adopt&shy;ing a de&shy;cep&shy;tive pat&shy;tern (eg sug&shy;gest&shy;ing I was in Eu&shy;rope rather than Japan). If Light had known he was leak&shy;ing tim&shy;ing in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion but did&shy;n’t know that some&shy;one out there was clever enough to use it (a “known un&shy;known”), then we might blame him; but how is Light sup&shy;posed to know these “un&shy;known un&shy;knowns”?</p>
	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">Ran&shy;dom&shy;iza&shy;tion</a> is the an&shy;swer. Ran&shy;dom&shy;iza&shy;tion and en&shy;cryp&shy;tion scram&shy;ble the cor&shy;re&shy;la&shy;tions be&shy;tween in&shy;put and out&shy;put, and they would serve as well in <em>Death Note</em> as they do in cryp&shy;tog&shy;ra&shy;phy &amp; sta&shy;tis&shy;tics in the real world, at the cost of some effi&shy;cien&shy;cy. The point of ran&shy;dom&shy;iza&shy;tion, both in cryp&shy;tog&shy;ra&shy;phy and in sta&shy;tis&shy;ti&shy;cal ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ments, is to not just pre&shy;vent the leaked in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounders" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">con&shy;founders</a> (re&shy;spec&shy;tive&shy;ly) you do know about but also the ones you do <em>not</em> yet know about.</p>
	<p>To steal &amp; para&shy;phrase an ex&shy;am&shy;ple from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Manzi_%28software_entrepreneur%29" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">Jim Manz&shy;i’s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Uncontrolled-Surprising-Trial---Error-Business/dp/046502324X/?tag=gwernnet-20" class="no-popup"><em>Un&shy;con&shy;trolled</em></a>: you’re run&shy;ning a weight-loss ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ment. You know that the effec&shy;tive&shy;ness might vary with each sub&shy;jec&shy;t’s pre-ex&shy;ist&shy;ing weight, but you don’t be&shy;lieve in ran&shy;dom&shy;iza&shy;tion (y&shy;ou’re a prac&shy;ti&shy;cal man! only prissy sta&shy;tis&shy;ti&shy;cians worry about ran&shy;dom&shy;iza&shy;tion!); so you split the sub&shy;jects by weight, and for con&shy;ve&shy;nience you al&shy;lo&shy;cate them by when they show up to your ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;men&shy;t—in the end, there are ex&shy;actly 10 ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;men&shy;tal sub&shy;jects over 150 pounds and 10 con&shy;trols over 150 pounds, and so on and so forth. Un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, it turns out that un&shy;be&shy;knownst to you, a ge&shy;netic vari&shy;ant con&shy;trols weight gain and a whole ex&shy;tended fam&shy;ily showed up at your ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ment early on and they all got al&shy;lo&shy;cated to ‘ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;men&shy;tal’ and none of them to ‘con&shy;trol’ (s&shy;ince you did&shy;n’t need to ran&shy;dom&shy;ize, right? you were mak&shy;ing sure the groups were matched on weight!). Your ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ment is now bo&shy;gus and mis&shy;lead&shy;ing. Of course, you could run a sec&shy;ond ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ment where you make sure the ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;men&shy;tal and con&shy;trol groups are matched on weight and also now matched on that ge&shy;netic vari&shy;ant… but now there’s the po&shy;ten&shy;tial for some <em>third</em> con&shy;founder to hit you. If only you had used ran&shy;dom&shy;iza&shy;tion—then you would prob&shy;a&shy;bly have put some of the vari&shy;ants into the other group as well and your re&shy;sults would&shy;n’t’ve been bo&shy;gus!</p>
	<p>So to deal with Light’s first mis&shy;take, sim&shy;ply sched&shy;ul&shy;ing every death on the hour will not work be&shy;cause the wake-sleep cy&shy;cle is still pre&shy;sent. If he set up a list and wrote down <em>n</em> crim&shy;i&shy;nals for each hour to elim&shy;i&shy;nate the peak-troughs rather than ran&shy;dom&shy;iz&shy;ing, could that still go wrong? May&shy;be: we don’t know what in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion might be left in the data which an L or Tur&shy;ing could de&shy;ci&shy;pher. I can spec&shy;u&shy;late about one pos&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty—the al&shy;lo&shy;ca&shy;tion of each kind of crim&shy;i&shy;nal to each hour. If one were to draw up lists and go in or&shy;der (hey, one does&shy;n’t need ran&shy;dom&shy;iza&shy;tion, right?), then the or&shy;der might go ‘crim&shy;i&shy;nals in the morn&shy;ing news&shy;pa&shy;per, crim&shy;i&shy;nals on TV, crim&shy;i&shy;nals whose de&shy;tails were not im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ately given but were avail&shy;able on&shy;line, crim&shy;i&shy;nals from years ago, his&shy;tor&shy;i&shy;cal crim&shy;i&shy;nals etc’; if the morn&shy;ing-news&shy;pa&shy;per-crim&shy;i&shy;nals start at say 6 <span class="smallcaps-auto">AM</span> Japan time… And al&shy;lo&shy;cat&shy;ing evenly might be hard, since there’s nat&shy;u&shy;rally go&shy;ing to be short&shy;falls when there just aren’t many crim&shy;i&shy;nals that day or the news&shy;pa&shy;pers aren’t pub&shy;lish&shy;ing (hol&shy;i&shy;days?) etc., so the short&shy;fall pe&shy;ri&shy;ods will pin&shy;point what the Kira con&shy;sid&shy;ers ‘end of the day’.</p>
	<p>A much safer pro&shy;ce&shy;dure is thor&shy;ough-go&shy;ing ran&shy;dom&shy;iza&shy;tion ap&shy;plied to tim&shy;ing, sub&shy;jects, and man&shy;ner of death. Even if we as&shy;sume that Light was bound and de&shy;ter&shy;mined to re&shy;veal the ex&shy;is&shy;tence of Kira and gain pub&shy;lic&shy;ity and in&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tional no&shy;to&shy;ri&shy;ety (a ma&shy;jor char&shy;ac&shy;ter flaw in its own right; ac&shy;com&shy;plish&shy;ing things, tak&shy;ing cred&shy;it—&shy;choose one), he still did not have to re&shy;duce his anonymity much past 32 bits.</p>
	<ol type="1">
	<li>Each ex&shy;e&shy;cu&shy;tion’s time could be de&shy;ter&shy;mined by a ran&shy;dom dice roll (say, a 24-sided dice for hours and a 60-sided dice for min&shy;utes).</li>
	<li>Se&shy;lect&shy;ing method of death could be done sim&shy;i&shy;larly based on eas&shy;ily re&shy;searched de&shy;mo&shy;graphic data, al&shy;though per&shy;haps ir&shy;rel&shy;e&shy;vant (serv&shy;ing mostly to con&shy;ceal that a killing has taken place).</li>
	<li>Se&shy;lect&shy;ing crim&shy;i&shy;nals could be based on in&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;ally ac&shy;ces&shy;si&shy;ble pe&shy;ri&shy;od&shy;i&shy;cals that plau&shy;si&shy;bly every hu&shy;man has ac&shy;cess to, such as the <em>New York Times</em>, and deaths could be de&shy;layed by months or years to broaden the pos&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ties as to where the Kira learned of the vic&shy;tim (TV? books? the In&shy;ter&shy;net?) and avoid&shy;ing is&shy;sues like killing a crim&shy;i&shy;nal only pub&shy;li&shy;cized on one ob&shy;scure Japan&shy;ese pub&shy;lic tele&shy;vi&shy;sion chan&shy;nel. And so on.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Let’s re&shy;mem&shy;ber that all this is pred&shy;i&shy;cated on anonymi&shy;ty, and on Light us&shy;ing low-tech strate&shy;gies; as one per&shy;son asked me, “why does&shy;n’t Light set up an cryp&shy;to&shy;graphic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_market" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">as&shy;sas&shy;si&shy;na&shy;tion mar&shy;ket</a> or just take over the world? He would win with&shy;out all this clev&shy;er&shy;ness.” Well, then it would not be <em>Death Note</em>.</p>


	<h3>APPENDICES</h3>
	<h4>COMMUNICATING WITH A DEATH NOTE</h4>
	<p>One might won&shy;der how much in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion one could send <em>in&shy;ten&shy;tion&shy;ally</em> with a Death Note, as op&shy;posed to in&shy;ad&shy;ver&shy;tently leak bits about one’s iden&shy;ti&shy;ty. As deaths are by and large pub&shy;licly known in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion, we’ll as&shy;sume the sender and re&shy;cip&shy;i&shy;ent have some sort of pre-arranged key or one-time pad (although one would won&shy;der why they’d use such an im&shy;moral and clumsy sys&shy;tem as op&shy;posed to steganog&shy;ra&shy;phy or mes&shy;sages on&shy;line).</p>
	<p>A death in&shy;flicted by a Death Note has 3 main dis&shy;tin&shy;guish&shy;ing traits which one can con&shy;trol—who, when, and how:</p>
	<ol type="1">
	<li><p>the <strong>per&shy;son</strong></p>
	<p>The ‘who?’ is al&shy;ready cal&shy;cu&shy;lated for us: if it takes 33 bits to spec&shy;ify a unique hu&shy;man, then a par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar hu&shy;man can con&shy;vey 33 bits. Con&shy;cerns about learn&shy;abil&shy;ity (how would you learn of an Ama&shy;zon tribesman’s death?) im&shy;ply that it’s re&shy;ally &lt;33 bits.</p>
	<p>If you try some scheme to en&shy;code more bits into the choice of as&shy;sas&shy;si&shy;na&shy;tion, you ei&shy;ther wind up with 33 bits or you wind up un&shy;able to con&shy;vey cer&shy;tain com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tions of bits and effec&shy;tively 33 bits any&shy;way—y&shy;our scheme will tell you that to con&shy;vey your des&shy;per&shy;ately im&shy;por&shy;tant mes&shy;sage <em>X</em> of 50 bits telling all about L’s true iden&shy;tity and how you dis&shy;cov&shy;ered it, you need to kill an Ola&shy;fur Ja&shy;cobs of Tan&shy;za&shy;nia who weighs more than 200 pounds and is from Tai&shy;wan, but alas! Ja&shy;cobs does&shy;n’t ex&shy;ist for you to kill.</p></li>
	<li><p>the <strong>time</strong></p>
	<p>The ‘when’ is han&shy;dled by sim&shy;i&shy;lar rea&shy;son&shy;ing. There is a cer&shy;tain gran&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ity to Death Note kills: even if <em>it</em> is ca&shy;pa&shy;ble of tim&shy;ing deaths down to the nanosec&shy;ond, one can’t ac&shy;tu&shy;ally wit&shy;ness this or re&shy;ceive records of this. Doc&shy;tors may note time of death down to the min&shy;ute, but no finer (and how do you get such pre&shy;cise med&shy;ical records any&shy;way?). News re&shy;ports may be even less ac&shy;cu&shy;rate, not&shy;ing merely that it hap&shy;pened in the morn&shy;ing or in the late evening. In rare cases like live broad&shy;casts, one may be able to do a lit&shy;tle bet&shy;ter, but even they tend to be de&shy;layed by a few sec&shy;onds or min&shy;utes to al&shy;low for buffer&shy;ing, tech&shy;ni&shy;cal glitches be fixed, the stenog&shy;ra&shy;phers pro&shy;duce the closed cap&shy;tion&shy;ing, or sim&shy;ply to guard against em&shy;bar&shy;rass&shy;ing events (like Janet Jack&shy;son’s nip&shy;ple-s&shy;lip). So we’ll not as&shy;sume the tim&shy;ing can be more ac&shy;cu&shy;rate than the minute. But which min&shy;utes does a Death Note user have to choose from? Inas&shy;much as the Death Note is ap&shy;par&shy;ently in&shy;ca&shy;pable of in&shy;flu&shy;enc&shy;ing the past or caus&shy;ing Pratch&shy;et&shy;t&shy;ian<a href="#sn21" class="footnote-ref spawns-popup" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> su&shy;per&shy;lu&shy;mi&shy;nal effects, the past is off-lim&shy;its; but mes&shy;sages also have to be sent in time for what&shy;ever they are sup&shy;posed to in&shy;flu&shy;ence, so one can&shy;not afford to have a win&shy;dow of a cen&shy;tu&shy;ry. If the mes&shy;sage needs to affect some&shy;thing within the day, then the user has a win&shy;dow of only 60 · 24 = 1440 min&shy;utes, which is log<sub>2</sub>(1440) = 10.49 bits; if the user has a win&shy;dow of a year, that’s slightly bet&shy;ter, as a death’s tim&shy;ing down to the minute could em&shy;body as much as log<sub>2</sub>(60 · 24 · 365) = 19 bits. (Over a decade then is 22.3 bits, etc.) If we al&shy;low tim&shy;ing down to the sec&shy;ond, then a year would be 24.9 bits. In any case, it’s clear that we’re not go&shy;ing to get more than 33 bits from the date. On the plus side, an ‘IP over Death’ pro&shy;to&shy;col would be su&shy;pe&shy;rior to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">some other pro&shy;to&shy;cols</a>—here, the worse your la&shy;ten&shy;cy, the more bits you could ex&shy;tract from the pack&shy;et’s time&shy;stamp! <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Comics" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">Di&shy;nosaur Comics</a></em> on <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=354" title="T-Rex As: 'The Computer Scientist'" class="no-popup">com&shy;pres&shy;sion schemes</a>:</p>

	<li><p>the <strong>cir&shy;cum&shy;stances</strong> (such as the place)</p>
	<p>The ‘how’… has many more de&shy;grees of free&shy;dom. The cir&shy;cum&shy;stances is much more diffi&shy;cult to cal&shy;cu&shy;late. We can sub&shy;di&shy;vide it in a lot of ways; here’s one:</p>
	<ol type="1">
	<li><p><span class="smallcaps">Lo&shy;ca&shy;tion</span> (eg. lat&shy;i&shy;tude/<wbr>&shy;lon&shy;gi&shy;tude)</p>
	<p>Earth has ~510,072,000,000 square me&shy;ters of sur&shy;face area; most of it is en&shy;tirely use&shy;less from our per&shy;spec&shy;tive—if some&shy;one is in an air&shy;plane and dies, how on earth does one fig&shy;ure out the ex&shy;act square me&shy;ter he was above? Or on the oceans? Earth has ~148,940,000,000 square me&shy;ters of <em>land</em>, which is more us&shy;able: the usual cal&shy;cu&shy;la&shy;tions gives us log<sub>2</sub>(148940000000) = 37.12 bits. (Sur&shy;prised at how sim&shy;i&shy;lar to the ‘who?’ bit cal&shy;cu&shy;la&shy;tion this is? But 37.12 - 33 = 4.12 and 2<sup>4.12</sup> = 17.4. The SF clas&shy;sic <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_on_Zanzibar" class="docMetadata has-annotation spawns-popup">Stand on Zanz&shy;ibar</a></em> drew its name from the ob&shy;ser&shy;va&shy;tion that the 7 bil&shy;lion peo&shy;ple alive in 2010 would fit in Zanz&shy;ibar only if they stood shoul&shy;der to shoul&shy;der—spread them out, and mul&shy;ti&shy;ply that area by ~18…) This raises an is&shy;sue that affects all 3: how much can the Death Note con&shy;trol? Can it move vic&shy;tims to ar&shy;bi&shy;trary points in, say, Siberia? Or is it lim&shy;ited to within dri&shy;ving dis&shy;tance? etc. Any of those is&shy;sues could shrink the 37 bits by a great deal.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="smallcaps">Cause Of Death</span></p>
	<p>The <a href="/docs/www/www.who.int/740f2fd2de8a5e624f5cc915e5b6ab0945ca4dae.html" class="localArchive has-content spawns-popup" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/index.html" data-attribute-title="(Original URL: http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/index.html )">In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tional Clas&shy;si&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion of Dis&shy;eases</a> lists up&shy;wards of 20,000 dis&shy;eases, and we can imag&shy;ine thou&shy;sands of pos&shy;si&shy;ble ac&shy;ci&shy;den&shy;tal or de&shy;lib&shy;er&shy;ate deaths. But what mat&shy;ters is what gets com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;cat&shy;ed: if there are 500 dis&shy;tinct brain can&shy;cers but the death is only re&shy;ported as ‘brain can&shy;cer’, the 500 count as 1 for our pur&shy;pos&shy;es. But we’ll be gen&shy;er&shy;ous and go with 20,000 for re&shy;ported dis&shy;eases plus ac&shy;ci&shy;dents, which is log<sub>2</sub>(20000) = 14.3 bits.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="smallcaps">Ac&shy;tion Prior To Death</span></p>
	<p>Ac&shy;tions prior to death over&shy;laps with ac&shy;ci&shy;den&shy;tal caus&shy;es; here the se&shy;ries does&shy;n’t help us. Light’s early ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ments cul&shy;mi&shy;nat&shy;ing in the “L, do you know death gods love ap&shy;ples?” seem to im&shy;ply that ac&shy;tions are lim&shy;ited in en&shy;tropy as each word took a death (as&shy;sum&shy;ing the or&shy;di&shy;nary Eng&shy;lish vo&shy;cab&shy;u&shy;lary of 50,000 words, 16 bit&shy;s), but other plot events im&shy;ply that hu&shy;mans can un&shy;der&shy;take long com&shy;plex plans at the or&shy;der of Death Notes (like Mikami bring&shy;ing the fake Death Note to the fi&shy;nal con&shy;fronta&shy;tion with Near). Ac&shy;tions be&shy;fore death could be re&shy;ported in great de&shy;tail, or they could be hid&shy;den un&shy;der offi&shy;cial se&shy;crecy like the afore&shy;men&shy;tioned death gods men&shy;tioned (Light uniquely priv&shy;i&shy;leged in learn&shy;ing it suc&shy;ceeded as part of L test&shy;ing him). I can’t be&shy;gin to guess how many dis&shy;tinct nar&shy;ra&shy;tives would sur&shy;vive trans&shy;mis&shy;sion or what lim&shy;its the Note would set. We must leave this one un&shy;de&shy;fined: it’s al&shy;most surely more than 10 bits, but how many?</p></li>
	</ol></li>
	</ol>
	<p>Sum&shy;ming, we get &lt;33 + &lt;19 + 17 + &lt;37 + 14 + ? = 120? bits per death.</p>

	<blockquote>
	<p>It is in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing to ap&shy;ply prob&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;ity the&shy;ory in var&shy;i&shy;ous sit&shy;u&shy;a&shy;tions in which we can’t al&shy;ways re&shy;duce it to num&shy;bers very well, but still it shows au&shy;to&shy;mat&shy;i&shy;cally what kind of in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion would be rel&shy;e&shy;vant to help us do plau&shy;si&shy;ble rea&shy;son&shy;ing. Sup&shy;pose some&shy;one in New York City has com&shy;mit&shy;ted a mur&shy;der, and you don’t know at first who it is, but you know that there are 10 mil&shy;lion peo&shy;ple in New York City. On the ba&shy;sis of no knowl&shy;edge but this, <em>e</em>(Guilty|X) = −70 <em>db</em> is the plau&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;ity that any par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar per&shy;son is the guilty one.</p>
	<p>How much pos&shy;i&shy;tive ev&shy;i&shy;dence for guilt is nec&shy;es&shy;sary be&shy;fore we de&shy;cide that some man should be put away? Per&shy;haps +40 <em>db</em>, al&shy;though your re&shy;ac&shy;tion may be that this is not safe enough, and the num&shy;ber ought to be high&shy;er. If we raise this num&shy;ber we give in&shy;creased pro&shy;tec&shy;tion to the in&shy;no&shy;cent, but at the cost of mak&shy;ing it more diffi&shy;cult to con&shy;vict the guilty; and at some point the in&shy;ter&shy;ests of so&shy;ci&shy;ety as a whole can&shy;not be ig&shy;nored.</p>
	<p>For ex&shy;am&shy;ple, if 1000 guilty men are set free, we know from only too much ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence that 200 or 300 of them will pro&shy;ceed im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ately to in&shy;flict still more crimes upon so&shy;ci&shy;ety, and their es&shy;cap&shy;ing jus&shy;tice will en&shy;cour&shy;age 100 more to take up crime. So it is clear that the dam&shy;age to so&shy;ci&shy;ety as a whole caused by al&shy;low&shy;ing 1000 guilty men to go free, is far greater than that caused by falsely con&shy;vict&shy;ing one in&shy;no&shy;cent man.</p>
	<p>If you have an emo&shy;tional re&shy;ac&shy;tion against this state&shy;ment, I ask you to think: if you were a judge, would you rather face one man whom you had con&shy;victed false&shy;ly; or 100 vic&shy;tims of crimes that you could have pre&shy;vent&shy;ed? Set&shy;ting the thresh&shy;old at +40 <em>db</em> will mean, crude&shy;ly, that on the av&shy;er&shy;age not more than one con&shy;vic&shy;tion in 10,000 will be in er&shy;ror; a judge who re&shy;quired ju&shy;ries to fol&shy;low this rule would prob&shy;a&shy;bly not make one false con&shy;vic&shy;tion in a work&shy;ing life&shy;time on the bench.</p>
	<p>In any event, if we took +40 db start&shy;ing out from −70 db, this means that in or&shy;der to en&shy;sure a con&shy;vic&shy;tion you would have to pro&shy;duce about 110 db of ev&shy;i&shy;dence for the guilt of this par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar per&shy;son. Sup&shy;pose now we learn that this per&shy;son had a mo&shy;tive. What does that do to the plau&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;ity for his guilt? Prob&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;ity the&shy;ory says</p>

	<p>This ev&shy;i&shy;dently agrees with our com&shy;mon sense, if we pon&shy;der it for a mo&shy;ment. If the de&shy;ceased were kind and loved by all, hardly any&shy;one would have a mo&shy;tive to do him in. Learn&shy;ing that, nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less, our sus&shy;pect <em>did</em> have a mo&shy;tive, would then be very [im&shy;por&shy;tant] in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion. If the vic&shy;tim had been an un&shy;sa&shy;vory char&shy;ac&shy;ter, who took great de&shy;light in all sorts of foul deeds, then a great many peo&shy;ple would have a mo&shy;tive, and learn&shy;ing that our sus&shy;pect was one of them is not so [im&shy;por&shy;tan&shy;t]. The point of this is that we don’t know what to make of the in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion that our sus&shy;pect had a mo&shy;tive, un&shy;less we also know some&shy;thing about the char&shy;ac&shy;ter of the de&shy;ceased.

	<p>You see that the pop&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion of New York has can&shy;celed out of the equa&shy;tion; as soon as we know the num&shy;ber of peo&shy;ple who had a mo&shy;tive, then it does&shy;n’t mat&shy;ter any more how large the city was. Note that (5-39) con&shy;tin&shy;ues to say the right thing even when <span class="math inline"><span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math" aria-label="N_m"><span class="mjx-mrow" aria-hidden="true"><span class="mjx-msubsup"><span class="mjx-base" style="margin-right: -0.085em;"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.085em;">N</span></span></span><span class="mjx-sub" style="font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;"><span class="mjx-mi" style=""><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;">m</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is only 1 or 2.</p>
	<p>You can go on this way for a long time, and we think you will find it both en&shy;light&shy;en&shy;ing and en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing to do so. For ex&shy;am&shy;ple, we now learn that the sus&shy;pect was seen near the scene of the crime shortly be&shy;fore. From Bayes’ the&shy;o&shy;rem, the [im&shy;por&shy;tance] of this de&shy;pends al&shy;most en&shy;tirely on how many in&shy;no&shy;cent per&shy;sons were also in the vicin&shy;i&shy;ty. If you have ever been told not to trust Bayes’ the&shy;o&shy;rem, you should fol&shy;low a few ex&shy;am&shy;ples like this a good deal fur&shy;ther, and see how in&shy;fal&shy;li&shy;bly it tells you what in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion would be rel&shy;e&shy;vant, what ir&shy;rel&shy;e&shy;vant, in plau&shy;si&shy;ble rea&shy;son&shy;ing.<a href="#sn22" class="footnote-ref spawns-popup" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
	<p>In re&shy;cent years there has grown up a con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;able lit&shy;er&shy;a&shy;ture on Bayesian ju&shy;rispru&shy;dence; for a re&shy;view with many ref&shy;er&shy;ences, see Vi&shy;g&shy;naux and Robert&shy;son (1996) [This is ap&shy;par&shy;ently <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Interpreting-Evidence-Evaluating-Forensic-Courtroom/dp/0471960268/?tag=gwernnet-20" class="no-popup"><em>In&shy;ter&shy;pret&shy;ing Ev&shy;i&shy;dence: Eval&shy;u&shy;at&shy;ing Foren&shy;sic Sci&shy;ence in the Court&shy;room</em></a> –Ed&shy;i&shy;tor].</p>
	<p>Even in sit&shy;u&shy;a&shy;tions where we would be quite un&shy;able to say that nu&shy;mer&shy;i&shy;cal val&shy;ues should be used, Bayes’ the&shy;o&shy;rem still re&shy;pro&shy;duces qual&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tively just what your com&shy;mon sense (after per&shy;haps some med&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tion) tells you. This is the fact that George Polya demon&shy;strated in such o ex&shy;haus&shy;tive de&shy;tail that the present writer was con&shy;vinced that the con&shy;nec&shy;tion must be more than qual&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tive.</p>
