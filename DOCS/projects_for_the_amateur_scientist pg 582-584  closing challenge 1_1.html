<h1><strong>A CLOSING CHALLENGE</strong></h1>
<p><br></p>
<h3><strong>The Amateur is Invited to Design Experiments of His Own</strong></h3>
<p>Having invited you throughout this volume to repeat some of the classic experiments devised for separating fact from fancy, we close on a more challenging note: <strong>Why not design an experiment of your own?</strong></p>
<p>You begin with two requisites — an interesting set of observations and a clearly stated question. From these, you construct a theory and then devise an experiment to test the worth of your tentative guess.</p>
<p>As a starter, consider the charming little puzzle that was submitted to the readers of <em>Scientific American</em> by Ernest Hunter Wright, the retired former head of the Department of English at Columbia University. Many readers theorized about the problem and submitted logical guesses to Dr. Wright. But nobody, to my knowledge, has thus far put the question to nature in the form of a rigorously controlled experiment. So the puzzle must be categorized as "unsolved."</p>
<p>Here, then, in the propounder’s own words, is a scientific challenge worthy of your talents.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3><strong>E.H. Wright Presents the Puzzle of the Skipping Stones</strong></h3>
<p>With the luck of a layman, I have had the novel experience of seeing several of the men who plucked the heart out of the atom's mystery scratch their heads in vain for the solution of a problem which I now submit to a wider audience.</p>
<p>We all think we know what happens when we skip a stone across a water surface. We believe that it bounces over the water in a series of successively shorter leaps until it finally stops and sinks. Of course, the number and length of the leaps vary with the smoothness of the water, the size and shape of the stone, the speed and skill of the throw, and other conditions. But by and large, the missile seems to act about as I have said.</p>
<p>I am fairly sure it does no such thing. I think a stone does not behave on water in the way described because I know it does not behave that way on sand — the hard, wet sand at the water's edge. So first, let me tell you what the stone does on the sand and how I came to know about it.</p>
<p>I found it out in the course of a long walk along the beach. I had been skipping pebbles over the water. (By the way, I wish someone could tell me precisely why beach pebbles are always flattened rather than spherical — no geologist has given me a satisfactory answer.) Because the water rolling into the beach was too rough for good performance, I decided to see how a pebble would behave on the hard, wet sand. On this surface, of course, it would leave little marks recording its travel.</p>
<p>When I saw the marks left in the sand by my first pebble, I think I must have been as astonished as old Crusoe on beholding the first footprint of his man Friday! The first bounce of the pebble was only four inches long; the next was nearly seven feet. Then came another short hop of only four inches, followed by a leap of about five feet, then again the four-inch hop, and so on for seven big hops punctuated by the four-inch ones. Each short skip was unmistakably recorded by two neat little marks in the sand. After the seventh repetition, the pebble ceased this strange behavior and merely jumped along with successively shorter strides until it stopped. The total number of hops was about 20 — my average on hard sand.</p>
<p>I kept skipping pebbles all afternoon, mile after mile along the beach. I tried them in all shapes and sizes, over every contour of terrain that I could find, at every angle at which it was possible to launch them. I tried all the variations I could think of, and I went back a second day and tried them all again. Without exception, the result was just about the same.</p>
<p>Now I fancy the same thing happens on the water, though in the water there is no imprint left to tell the story. A proper record with a camera would give us the answer. In the sand, at least, the story is quite clear, and a very pretty story it is — as pretty as the tracks of some little animal in the fresh snow.</p>
<p>As yet, I have no explanation for these facts. I have put the problem before several physicists of high distinction, but so far, I have received no answer in return. Somewhere, there must be an answer for my little riddle. <strong>Who will find it?</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<h3><strong>Previous Suggestions (and Why They Fail)</strong></h3>
<p>I may save some trouble if I say that two or three suggestions have already been tested and found wanting.</p>
<p>One was that each of the double marks is the result of the pebble turning over when it strikes the sand. I can imagine no reason why the pebble should turn over, and at all events, I can certify from scrutiny that the stone does not turn over — and so can the companions who have watched it with me.</p>
<p>Another suggestion was that the pebble, striking the sand at a tilt, might hit with its rear end first, do a little flop, and strike with its front end before taking off for the long leap. But this supposes a precision of timing and a uniformity of tilt at each landing which are beyond all credence. Besides, why would a big stone make its flop within the same space (four inches) as a tiny one? As a matter of fact, the marks in the sand show that the stone usually strikes the sand flat, and all the observers agree with me that there is no flop.</p>
<p>The only other suggestion so far is that the pebble's spin around its vertical axis may account for its strange action. Why such a spin should make it behave the way it does is not clear to me. But we do not need to labor the question because I have thrown pebbles without any spin (it can be done), and they all left the same mincing steps in the sand.</p>

<h3><strong>A Challenge for Future Experimentation</strong></h3>
<p>So, what scientist, professional or amateur, wants to go down to the beach with all the needful instruments and find the answer to my riddle? I shall be glad to go along if I am wanted; I can throw pretty well.</p>
<p>Let me know if further adjustments are needed!</p>
