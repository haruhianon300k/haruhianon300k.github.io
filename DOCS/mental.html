                        <dd>
                            <b>Applejack</b>: Really? Well, the reason is because lightning creates enough energy to break up the nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere. The nitrogen then turns into nitrous oxide which dissolve in the rain
                            and seep into the earth. And, uh, nitrogen in the soil's real good for farmin'.

                            By the weather. See, 'cause the weather's fast and it's everywhere! So... [chuckles] You know... So how are you? And-and Applejack? My two best friends that, uh, that I am studying friendship with because

                            <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah, I bet you were. Still, that does kinda remind me of this interesting story I heard once. There were these two wizards: an evil one named Sham-Taku and a good one named Toggaf.
                            Toggaf was named as such because his dad thought it would be a funny surprise when he learned to spell his name backwards in school. So anyway, these two wizards were mortal enemies, and one day Toggaf managed to
                            track down Taku at an old inn somewhere. Toggaf burst into Taku's room and challenged him to a duel of magic. Of course they both paralyzed one another's bodies instantly, but they couldn't crush each other's
                            minds. They laid there on the floor for two days fighting one another in a battle of pure concentration. The cleaning maid came in and tidied up the place without realizing that she was stepping in between an
                            epic battle of good versus evil. And anyway, the point of this story that I feel like that maid, except instead of a battle between two wizards, it was more like a battle between two completely stupid ponies.

                        <dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: So you just wandered in? Do you like colorin'?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Uh, that depends. Are you offering to let me do a sketch of you?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I have seen such forbidden colors.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Well, that's good enough for me! You guys are better than Twist at least. Let's be friends. My name's Apple Bloom.</dd>

                        <dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I go by many names. Seaty Belt, Sweaty Belt, Treaty Teats... But you may call me... Thrackerzod! I am a typical pony.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: So since we're all friends now, baby, do you guys wanna play a party game like Truth or Dare, Spin the Bottle, or Seven Minutes in Heaven?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I think we should all band together and <i>kill Twilight Sparkle</i>.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: I like the cut of your jib. But have you ever considered just convertin' her over to our way of thinkin'?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Yes... Perhaps we should convert her... into a murdered pony!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Every time one of us does a dare correctly, we could – hooah! – get a piece of candy.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Don't eat that or you'll have to run laps across the border!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: So tell Thrackerzod – as a joke because she is a normal pony – what would normal ponies consume?</dd>

                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: I think you were meant to study by <i>making</i> friends, not <i>watching</i> them.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's stupid. If you interfere with the test subjects, then the study is ruined.</dd>

                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Then what's the point? Why would Celestia even ask me to do that? She knows me.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Can't we at least try asking Pinkie directly now about some of her habits?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I think she's gonna lie about her sexual activity.</dd>

                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: She's gonna try and pretend she's in better health than she is.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: If she feels healthy, she doesn't need treatment.</dd>

                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'd ask how you think that's supposed to work, but I already know. Sadly. Today we're gonna learn about things I <i>don't</i> know.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You lied to Pinkie for research!</dd>

                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Do you ever have headaches, specifically in the morning?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yes, but only on Thursdays.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Do you feel like you have problems with nausea or vomiting?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Only when Pinkie is drunk. Yes. Or not drunk enough. On the Thursday.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Do you find you have issues with your hearing or your vision?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No. Yes. Except on Thursday.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Do you sometimes find it difficult to remember things?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yes! Pinkie cannot remember any of last Thursday! Pinkie begins to see a pattern.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie, how do you remember having all these symptoms on Thursday if you can't even remember last Thursday?!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Maybe Pinkie remembers incorrectly.</dd>

                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I think Pinkie Pie is a microcosm of case studies and she's never gonna fit into a model.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Well, certainly not with that attitude.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You know what I think? I think the moral of the story is that the social sciences are retarded.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: That's gonna make it awfully tough to research friendship, you know.</dd>
                        <dd>
                            <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, you know, I think that when you get right down to it, we could've learned a lot of different things from this little <i>episode</i>, but the main thing to take home is that you just
                            can't describe ponies with models. They're too diverse. They don't fit.

                            together, only instead of knowing each other, they avoid eye contact. It's also really expensive. Anyway, those really rich ponies would talk to Applejack and she wouldn't know how to respond. They'd be like,
                            "What's a rooster?" 'Cause they'd never seen a rooster. And AJ would wonder, "Should I tell them it's a bird or should I make up a lie and pretend it's something more exciting? It's a party; I should be
                            interesting." But then it was too late! They brought some food and the portions were really tiny and it was rated with a Magino star [Ponified Michilan Star]. So basically, it was like the kind of stuff most
                            ponies never taste in a lifetime. They bring out the one little one, and you think, "Oh, is this all?" But then they come out with more stuff and they keep going all night until you're full.

                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm not even really sure how to feed it. I don't know the first thing about owls. Do you think it's gonna fly out and feed itself or what?</dd>

                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No-no-no-no, Cadance and my brother sent it.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh. The third princess, yeah. She and your brother have been dating for a while now.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah. Yeah, my mom's been badgering him about engagement. They've been talking about it, but nothing yet.</dd>

                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah, she and Dad are getting along, and I'm... We're both getting old enough now. She's starting to write me about her... her sex life. [nervous chuckle] So... they're doing okay.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh, boy. Just what you wanted to hear.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's... you know, it's... whatever. I mean, she knows I've got a lot of medical background, so I kinda default as the family... I don't know, doctor, I guess.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh-oh. What kind of bedroom business requires a doctor?</dd>
                        <dd>
                            <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Nothing. She just doesn't know what I know, so she'll ask questions and fish for answers. If I know something, I can help out. But it tends to be stuff like, "Is Dad", you know, "still
                            young enough to do this?", or-or "Could I die from a perforated colon?"

                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Meh. Well, I've been wondering though. Could you tell me, what is Cadance a princess of?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The color pink!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh, come on.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I think love. But I never really figured out for sure, because how do you rule over an intangible concept?</dd>
                        <dd>
                            <b>Spike</b>: Sounds like cheating. If someone doesn't like the way you been ruling, you say, "What?! You don't like the way I've been ruling?! Well, if you're not in love with the way I'm doing things, clearly
                            it's not in my jurisdiction."

                        <dd>
                            <b>Spike</b>: Well, the God-Princess of the Sun is your personal teacher, the God-Princess of Love is your personal babysitter, your brother is the commander of the royal guard, and your family's only
                            upper-middle class.
                        </dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: So my family's upper-middle class. That's not weird.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: That's not the weird part. The weird part is that your family isn't politically influential, and yet somehow you're still the center of <i>everything</i>.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No... That's an exaggeration.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Now hear me out, because this keeps me up at night and I am shocked that you haven't thought of it yourself. What if there's a reason for it? What if they're focused on you for something?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, come on. You gotta use Occam's razor. I think Celestia is just aware of my magical potential and she's keeping me in check.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh, come on, Twilight. You're good, but you're not <i>that</i> good. Ask yourself – do you think you could ever lead a country?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, alright. What do you <i>think</i> it means? Because otherwise we're just making assumptions.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: I don't know, but look at the circumstances. Celestia has your family close to her there in Canterlot, she sent you away to Ponyville where you can't reach them...</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Which still implies I'm the potential threat.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Twilight, moving family around is something you do with provincial leaders. If it was just you she was worried about, then why wouldn't she just worry about <i>you</i>?</dd>
                        <dd>
                            <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike, it's been real quiet in Ponyville and I don't want to think about this or else I'm gonna stay up for the rest of the week. So go and help me find a book on this stupid bird in my

                        </dd>

                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No. Not today.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Okay, fine. What kind of owl is it?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I don't know. Get the book so we can look it up!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Okay, I'm going! So aside from figuring out how we're gonna feed this thing, what do you hope to learn?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Maybe I can teach it tricks. Like, to fetch books or something.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh, gunning for my job, huh?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You gonna get jealous?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh, heaven forbid I don't get to do this more often. I don't think that bird could carry books anyway.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Maybe children's books.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: You know what'd be good? If that owl had levitation powers. If that owl could levitate books, then I wouldn't have to climb up here and put my life in danger!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We <i>do</i> need a taller ladder. But it's gonna come out of your allowance.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Why?!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Life's about earning, Spike.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: But I never earn anything, no matter how hard I work! Also, I can't find your stupid book.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, look harder.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: I'm piercing the shelves with my fiercest gaze. I'm not seeing it.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, come on, that's impossible. I just reorganized yesterday.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Well, see, that's the problem! It's <i>dis</i>organized! You keep reorganizing it, I can never find anything.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's a really simple system. It should be next to the book on vowels.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: You have got to be kidding me. This system is never gonna work.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It works like a mnemonic device. Once you learn it, it's gonna revolutionize the way that you find books.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Okay, I found your book, but we're gonna have to change the system again.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What? No, Spike, learn the <i>new</i> system. It's better.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Nae.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Once you learn it, you're gonna find it's so much easier to remember where stuff is.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: I have had up to here with this, Twilight! I am not learning a new organizational pattern every single week!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Fine! Stay in the past with Dewey Decimal. See if I care.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Thank you. You micromanage too much, you know.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Whatever. Gotta know what to do with this bird. I mean... it can see in the dark. Maybe it could lead me around when it's dark?</dd>
                        <dd>
                            <b>Spike</b>: It's not a seeing-eye dog, Twilight. And besides, I'm a dragon. We live in caves. I've got a certain amount of dark sight if you need it. How would you find an owl in the dark anyway? The whole
                            point of their natural camouflage is not to be seen.
                        </dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm just grasping at straws here, okay? I dunno. Maybe I can use his feathers for quills when he molts.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Aye. He looks a bit small, but he's probably big enough for that. Quills only cost about one or two bits though.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Adds up over time.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: I guess it does.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I mean, if he feeds himself, it's... it's kind of like a net gain.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Except for me who has to clean up after his droppings.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: So okay. He's useful somehow. That means he's not a pet. We know what happens to pets. He's a utility bird.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Alright. What do you want to name the utility bird?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: How about "Owlowiscious"?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: I don't even know to spell that. How about "Owl" for short? That way, it's easier to pass it off like we didn't name him.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: As though we're pronouncing it wrong? Like we're stupid?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Aye. You ever see Rainbow Dash make an ass of herself directly to Celestia, then get away with it? Boy, she must be on to something there.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No kidding. You could punish the girl, but she wouldn't know what she did wrong. If I could start all over, I would just play dumb from start to finish.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: You could've done that, but then you wouldn't get to read much that way.</dd>
                        <dd>
                            <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No, no, watch. It'd be something like this. "I love reading books to set a good example for kids. I may not understand all the big words, but I try my best to read the smartest-looking
                            books."
                        </dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh, I see. Very clever. I guess it takes a bit of wit to figure out how to play stupid correctly.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah, and the best part is that it makes perfect sense that I'd sing the rubber ducky song in my head all the time. Perfect shield for magical thought-reading.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: You've been giving this a lot of thought, haven't you?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah, I have. But it's too late to do it now. Everybody would see right through it. I'd have to wait for some kind of opening, but I don't know what.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Huh. You'd blend right in at Ponyville. Speaking of, you seem to have mellowed out a lot since you got here.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah. I guess I'm not as stressed out as I was.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Well, it's nice having a bit more input now and again. But don't let your guard down.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I know. But... Hey, Spike... nothing has changed, but for what it's worth...</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Just leave it, Twilight.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You make good pancakes.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Loud and clear. So are we going out today? Should I pack your bags or what?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No, I'm staying in. I don't see what the crime is with being a happy shut-in.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Spike</b>: Alright. I'm going to take a nap then. Just give me a call if you need something.</dd>

                        <dd><b>Gilda</b>: Ah, yes. Certainly an apparel for the more... <i>pleasant</i> of evenings. It's a little something I picked up in the griffon country for the trip here. Do you... like it?</dd>

                        <dd><b>Gilda</b>: Keep warm on these cold, foreign— Uh, then again, it is fine. We can decide later.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, you see, I've developed a really bad habit of kicking while I sleep, so... I can just prepare the couch. It's... It's a cloud futon.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Gilda</b>: I guess we'll just have to tire you out so you don't have the energy for kicking. [laughing]</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Aw, yeah! Man, I haven't done a good race in, like, forever! Ponyville is a slow city. Everybody is slow. Do you wanna go for a race?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Gilda</b>: I would enjoy that immensely, but you know, I am quite tired from my trip.</dd>

                            <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: It's a small town. So you pretty much get screwed on cable. Oh, um, also things that I do not have: plumbing is a big one. If you need to go to the bathrom, you can shower, but there's no
                            water treatment line connected, so you've gotta go to an outhouse below. Just let me know when you're ready, and I'll show you where it is. Then, this might not be a big deal 'cause it's pretty warm this time of
                            month, but the cloud walls are not really good for insulation. I couldn't afford the magic insulation, so if you get cold and need extra blankets, I've got some. Then of course, there's a big thunderstorm
                            scheduled for Thursday. My house isn't waterproof – I-I couldn't afford to magic-proof for that either. So we'll have to move the whole house out of town for a few hours.

                            Last year, I got frostbite from my head to my butt and I cried and I cried and they wouldn't let me off early because they thought I was faking. Really, it was because Tuba Sunbather blew off his job moving his
                            clouds, so I took over and got all wet without the special jackets that you need. Now, I tried to be nice and everything, but I got all up on his case, and he said he'd make it up to me. Like, he'd buy an ice
                            cream cone for me for the spring. But he never did! Maybe he thought I'd forget, but I didn't though! I got frostbite! I went to the doctor and everything! That was a really harsh lesson. I'm never gonna do that
                            again. It wasn't like that in Cloudsdale. Everyone was more aware of the weather, you know?

                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: A-Alright, s-so sell me a dress. I have to go to the Great Galloping Gala, and I need one.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: [sighs] Alright, give me just a minute. I have to grab my tape. I've got to do a few measurements.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: They come custom, right? I've got a few requests.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, I know where this is going. You want me to do something insane like sew a star map into your dress, and it has to be accurate. Well, I can do it, but it's going to cost a fortune.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Rarity, I am a practical pony. What part of asking you to turn my dress into a star map would be practical?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, regardless, it's going to cost a bit. It's not like you're just buying off the rack. So what's your budget?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No, seriously, this is bothering me now. How would I navigate the stars if the map were printed on my ass?</dd>
                        <dd>
                            <b>Rarity</b>: I don't know. You wouldn't use it for that. Maybe go chat with the stallions from the Canterlot Observatory. Offer to let them stargaze and then they'll be all impressed because, "Hey, look, it's
                            accurate!" Sort of. They'll let a bit pass if they're looking at your butt, okay? It's... eh.
                        </dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You <i>would</i> think of that. What coordinate system would you use?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: Is there more than one?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: There's hundreds of them. Maps are 2D, but the real world is 3D, Rarity. There's a lot of trigonometry.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: Alright, it would cost a <i>double</i> fortune. See? You shot yourself in the foot there, didn't you, smarty-pants? It's not gonna happen is what I'm getting at.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: A double fortune is, like, what? Four thousand bits?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: Okay, I have got to ask again. What is your budget?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You thinking about going to the Gala?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: I've thought about it, but I wasn't able to get a ticket.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: They're running about four thousand bits right now. Of course, selling them would be a felony.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: Twilight... a-are you implying that you could get me into the Gala?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah. I'm a very metropolitan pony. I could get a ticket mailed straight to your house. It'll have your name on it and everything.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: It's a boutique, not a house.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Whatever. I already gave away two tickets to Dash and Applejack.</dd>
                        <dd>[crash]</dd>

                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah. So... on the bright side, if you happen to find a ticket landed in your mailbox, it's not gonna look like you did me any special favors. And we won't get arrested.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So whatcha guys talking about? We gonna do an adventure?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: Twilight! How could you?! You-You could just actually give me the ticket! T-There's no way that I'm going to have time to make a dress worth four thousand bits!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I know, I know. Just make something worth a couple hundred, and... I don't know, set something up for Dash and AJ.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: But <i>why</i> do I have to work for <i>mine</i>?!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Because gratitude is not collateral, and what is Dash gonna trade me?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Comic books.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I live in a library!</dd>

                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: See? She's got nothing.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I was thinking that, one of these days, I could sell stuff out of my house like you guys.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: It's not a house! It's a boutique!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah. I spent as much money as I had on cashews. 'Cause I was gonna sell them. But then my house is a cloud so the cashews got wet and now they're ruined. Business over.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, that's too bad.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I heard they're thinking about building a McPone's around here. Maybe I could run the store.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: See? They're thinking of starting a McPone's. We are <i>not</i> a hamlet.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The licensee is gonna get screwed. You know it's just gonna be built into the train station, right?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: It doesn't matter where they build it. A hamlet doesn't have a McPone's.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Is this the modern world we live in? Seriously? Where a McPone's qualifies as a church and turns your hamlet into a village?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, if our god wasn't a sun god, maybe her church wouldn't have burned down.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'm gonna make a million bits running McPone's, and then I'm gonna buy the Wonderbolts, and then I'm just gonna make myself a Wonderbolt directly!</dd>

                            <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: To be a McPone's franchisee, you need at least eight hundred thousand bits saved up in the bank, fifty thousand to pay for the rights, and then ten percent of your profits go to

                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh. Right. You know, he owns the lease on Applejack's farm.</dd>

                        <dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I want mine to be aerodynamic. And have wings just like me.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: You're ordering a dress, Dash. It's supposed to be flowing and pretty.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But that's gonna have a lot of drag.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: This is going to be like designing clothes for three-year-olds, isn't it?!</dd>

                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yes! That as well! Pinkie has a degree!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm not questioning <i>if</i> she has powers—</dd>
                        <dd><b>Applejack</b>: Yes. Yes, you are. You just said to my face that psychiatry is full of crap.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm saying she <i>doesn't</i> have powers.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Applejack</b>: Then how does she see the future, Twilight? From analyzing dreams. It's your basic psychiatry.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It is true! And AJ has deep-seated issues with her parents! Yes. She has coped by devoting herself to apples to replace their absence.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Applejack</b>: Okay, now let's not get ahead of ourselves.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It all fits! Yes! She replaces the Apples with apples!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Applejack</b>: I farm to live. I don't really appreciate this psychic analysis, Pinkie, your degree aside.</dd>

                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And <i>you</i> fill the void of <i>your</i> life with books! Yes. Because you do not have... filling! For the void! T-The... true filling is... <i>What is the purpose of li...?!</i></dd>
                        <dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hard work, I think. To finish that thought.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I fill the void with alcohol and the distant belief that I have some kind of destiny that will work everything out.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: If the void has walls, maybe the walls of the void occupy physical space. So if you put a void inside a void, the second void is scrunched.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Applejack</b>: Really, Twi? I wouldn't think you'd take truck with destiny.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, I don't mean destiny so much as a mathematical sort of fate.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Applejack</b>: Yeah, that's what I said. Destiny.</dd>
                        <dd>
                            <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No, I mean, like, if you hit a ball, the ball moves. So everything depends on everything else if something is gonna land somewhere because something acted on that thing to put it there.
                        </dd>
                        <dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, generally, Twilight, that somethin' that puts you places is your own willingess to pick yourself up by the bootstraps.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah, which is all controlled by hormones and chemistry—</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And a desire to fill the void! Yes.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You are not a psychiatrist!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Pinkie is a psychopotamus.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Applejack</b>: Look, she can predict the future. There's no sense in tryin' to apply the scientific method.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Who's applying the scientific method? I'm not. I'm just being skeptical.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Applejack</b>: You're trying to observe an intangible reality. You always do this, Twilight, and it's always wrong. If it's real, you just gotta accept that it's real.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Or what?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Then you are living like Pinkie. Yes.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Applejack</b>: Delusional and insane.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No... Yes. Applejack traitor. Living by your own rules.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I just think it seems like something Pinkie would do. Going out of her way to set up an elaborate hoax so she can pretend to be psychic for attention.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] Pinkie can see! It is enormous!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, great. You're gonna bash me in the head again. Real hilarious.</dd>

                            Not only does she know this, but she recalls each of their names with immediate precision. Yes. She knows who is expecting children, who lost their jobs, and who has a blister the size of the candied yam. Not
                            only that, but Pinkie knows their schedules. Some of them are as predictable as clockwork. Yes. And it is they who are the most dangerous. They plod around town, seemingly minds blank, but Pinkie knows them.
                            Their roads let them slip deep within themselves, where they scheme, where they plot against Pinkie! Yes. And this one is the most devious of all. At precisely 3:04PM, she comes to Pinkie seeking the marshmallow

                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Gay ponises do not wear the badge so you know them, Rarity. Yes. They strike from the shadows. It is there that Pinkie is most powerful!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: Yes, they do. And I always wondered why <i>you</i> don't wear flannel.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Because Pinkie does not look good in flannel. Yes. Why would she wear flannel?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: Lesbians always wear flannel. This is why you're single. You don't know the language of fashion.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Spitfire had flannel PJ's. Man, she's gonna be so confused. I went to her hotel for an hour and I told her I was the element of <i>royalty</i>.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Applejack</b>: Thing is, I just don't understand how that propane started a fire in the main hall. I never took my cart in there.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: That is because...! B-Because... you! You are irresponsible! Yes.</dd>
                        <dd>[beat]</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Pinkie is innocent!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: Pinkie... what did <i>you</i> do during the Gala?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Nothing. Yes.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: Nothing?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Pinkie danced the Pony Pokey. Yes.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: At the Grand Galloping Gala?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yes.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: You spent four thousand bits to dance the Pony Pokey at the Grand Galloping Gala?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Applejack</b>: She didn't have to pay. Twilight gave her a ticket.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No, I didn't.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Applejack</b>: Yeah, you did. I remember me and Dash were there... Wait. Pinkie, did you buy a Gala ticket?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Pinkie snuck past the guards. Yes.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Not past Celestia's royal guard, you didn't. The tickets are magical and they sweep the place throughout the night.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: This is profiling! Yes! Where do these questions come from? Probably the yellow one caused the fire!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [slurring] I hate all of you!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: See? She is drunk with shame! She has pulled the wool to your eyes! Yes!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [slurring] I hate all of you!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: So... somebody gave Pinkie a Gala ticket.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No. No. Pinkie is a licensed pyrotechnician. Yes. Accelerants are Pinkie's craft. Also, also, she did not start the fire. Pinkie was acting independently. Yes.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, who would want to hire an arsonist – and also Pinkie Pie – to burn down a section of the royal castle?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Probably that insurance guy.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: Blueblood? No, he <i>sells</i> insurance, dear, so he doesn't get money if he has to pay for damages.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: He was saying his company insures the castle, and he's one of the stakeholders 'cause he trusts the insurance so much.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You were actually paying attention to that?</dd>
                        <dd>
                            <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Duh. I asked him, so I had to listen. Plus, for a long time I thought he was a doctor, and I thought I'd get a lollipop if I was a good girl. I didn't get a lollipop though, so obviously he's
                            the bad guy.
                        </dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: Come to think, he did keep trying to get me to go wait in the main hall. Even after the fire had started. He must've known something.</dd>
                        <dd>
                            <b>Applejack</b>: So that's it! It all makes sense now! Blueblood hired Pinkie Pie to sabotage the Gala so he could collect on the insurance money! Darn it, that <i>scum</i>! But the only question now is how did
                            he cause the grease fire on my cart?
                        </dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Maybe he didn't actually cause the grease fire.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Applejack</b>: It's the only logical explanation, Twilight! And it fits so perfectly in with his diabolical little scheme to frame me for his crime! This totally invalidates that fine I was given!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Or maybe you're a clumsy mudpony who shouldn't be operating scalding grease cookers with your face.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: Then we've cracked it! Blueblood staged the fire and Applejack is a clumsy mudpony!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, he... he could've sabotaged me. I don't think we should rule that out.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: We really should notify the authorities.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Applejack</b>: Wait, who are the authorities? Blueblood is royalty, ain't he?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, the princess, surely.</dd>
                        <dd>[beat]</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: Dash, did the princess have an insurance policy on the castle?</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: A big one!</dd>
                        <dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: She also hates the Gala.</dd>
                        <dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh. Well. Good work, team. We cracked the caper.</dd>
