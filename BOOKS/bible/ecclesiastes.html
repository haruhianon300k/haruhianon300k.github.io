	The words of Koheleth, son of David, King in Yerushalayim (Jerusalem).
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:2"><sup>2</sup></span>
	Vapid mirage, Koheleth said. Vapid mirage. All is mirage.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> 
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:3"><sup>3</sup></span>
	What benefits a man from all his labor that he labors under the sun?
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:4"><sup>4</sup></span>
	A generation goes and a generation comes, and the Earth forever stands.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:5"><sup>5</sup></span>
	And the sun rose, and the sun went, and to its place it strives to shine, there.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:6"><sup>6</sup></span>
	Going south, and turning northward, turn turning goes the wind, and on its meanderings the wind returns.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:7"><sup>7</sup></span>
	All the rivers go to the sea, but the sea is not full. To the place that the rivers go—there they continue to go.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:8"><sup>8</sup></span>
	All things are tiresome, no man can speak of it. No eye will be sated from seeing, and no ear will be filled from hearing.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:9"><sup>9</sup></span>
	What was is what will be, and what was done is what will be done. And there's nothing at all new under the sun.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:10"><sup>10</sup></span>
	There is a thing of which it is said, "Look, this here is new!". It already existed in the eons that was before us.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:11"><sup>11</sup></span>
	Of the first ones there is no memory, and even of the last ones who will come there will be no memory, if they will be the last.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:12"><sup>12</sup></span>
	I am Koheleth. I was a king over Israel, in Jerusalem.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:13"><sup>13</sup></span>
	And I endeavored in my heart to demand and seek for wisdom, over everything that had been done under the skies. It is a bad business that God gave to mankind, to agonize over.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:14"><sup>14</sup></span>
	I saw all the doings that had been done under the sun, and here it is all mirage and herding the wind.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:15"><sup>15</sup></span>
	The crooked could not be repaired, and the wants could not be numbered.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:16"><sup>16</sup></span>
	I spoke to my own heart, saying: "Here have I grown and increased in knowledge over everyone who was before me over Jerusalem, and my heart has seen much knowledge and wisdom.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:17"><sup>17</sup></span>
	And I dedicated my heart to knowledge and wisdom, and knowledge of silliness and foolishness; I knew that this too is the herding of wind.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:18"><sup>18</sup></span>
	Because as wisdom grows, anger grows, and one who adds knowledge, adds pain.
	</p>
	<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Chapter_2">Chapter 2</span></h2>
	<p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:1"><sup>1</sup></span>
	I said to myself, please go, try your hand at happiness, and see the good, and here it is also a mirage.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:2"><sup>2</sup></span>
	"To have fun", I said, "is madness. And happiness, what does it do?"
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:3"><sup>3</sup></span>
	I considered to myself to ply my flesh with wine, and my heart is used to wisdom, and to grasp onto folly, until I would see just how good to people is that which they do under the sky, in the number of their days.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:4"><sup>4</sup></span>
	I multiplied my deeds, for me I built houses, I planted for me vineyards.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:5"><sup>5</sup></span>
	I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted in them trees of every fruit.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:6"><sup>6</sup></span>
	I made me pools of water, to irrigate from them, a wood growing trees
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:7"><sup>7</sup></span>
	I bought servants and maidservants, and had slave-sons to my household, I had also much livestock of cattle and sheep, from all before me in Jerusalem.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:8"><sup>8</sup></span>
	I gathered to me silver also and gold, and purple-robes of the kings and the nations. I gathered to me male singers and female singers, and the delights of men--- a woman, then women.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:9"><sup>9</sup></span>
	And I added to me, and grew more, from everything before me in Jerusalem; except my wisdom stood in my way.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:10"><sup>10</sup></span>
	And all that my eyes asked to see, I did not lazily avoid: I did not prevent my heart from any happiness, because my heart was happy in all my labors, and this was my portion, from all my labors.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:11"><sup>11</sup></span>
	And I faced all the things that my hands have done, and the labor that I labored to do, and, look, everything is mirage and herding the wind, and there is no benefit under the sun.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:12"><sup>12</sup></span>
	And I turned to see wisdom and madness and folly; for what man will come after the king, over that which is already done.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:13"><sup>13</sup></span>
	And I saw that there is benefit to wisdom over folly, as the benefit of light over darkness.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:14"><sup>14</sup></span>
	The wise one, his eyes are in his head, and the foolish one, in darkness walks. and I also knew that the one thing will happen to all of them
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:15"><sup>15</sup></span>
	And I said to myself, as will happen to the fool, so it will happen to me. And for what have I become so wise? And I said to myself, that this too is a mirage.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:16"><sup>16</sup></span>
	Because there is no memory of the wise man nor the fool, forever, in the coming of the latter days, everything is forgotten, and how the wise man dies along with the fool.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:17"><sup>17</sup></span>
	And I hated life, because I did not like these happenings which happen under the sun: because everything is a mirage, herding the wind.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:18"><sup>18</sup></span>
	And I hated all my labor that I labored under the sun: that I will bequeath to the man that will come after me.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:19"><sup>19</sup></span>
	And who knows if he will be wise man or a fool? And he will control all my labor that I labored and studied under the sun. Also this is a mirage.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:20"><sup>20</sup></span>
	And I went in circles, to frustrate my heart, over all my labor that I labored under the sun.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:21"><sup>21</sup></span>
	Because there is a man who works with wisdom, with knowledge, and with skill. And the man that did not work at it, will get him his share--- this also is a mirage, and a great evil.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:22"><sup>22</sup></span>
	Because, what is it to the man, all his labor and the discipline of his heart--- that he has labored under the sun?
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:23"><sup>23</sup></span>
	Because all of his days are painful, and anger is his business--- at night too, his heart does not rest, and this too is a mirage.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:24"><sup>24</sup></span>
	There is no good in the man that eats and drinks, and sees his soul well in his labor. This too, I saw, that from the hand of God it comes.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:25"><sup>25</sup></span>
	Because who will eat and who will feel, except for me?
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:26"><sup>26</sup></span>
	Because the man that is good before him, he gave wisdom, and knowledge and happiness, and to the sinner he gave a task of gathering and collecting, to give the good before God--- this too is a mirage, herding the wind.
	</p>
	<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Chapter_3">Chapter 3</span></h2>
	<p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:1"><sup>1</sup></span>
	To everything there is a moment, a time for all that's sought under the sky.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:2"><sup>2</sup></span>
	A time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot the planted. 
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:3"><sup>3</sup></span>
	A time to kill and a time to heal, a time to break-down, and a time to build.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:4"><sup>4</sup></span>
	A time to weep and a time to be merry, a time for mourning, and a time for dancing.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:5"><sup>5</sup></span>
	A time to throw stones and a time to collect stones, a time to embrace, and a time to keep away from embrace.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:6"><sup>6</sup></span>
	A time to seek, and a time to lose, a time to keep and a time to discard.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:7"><sup>7</sup></span>
	A time to rip, and a time to sew, a time to mute and time to talk,
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:8"><sup>8</sup></span>
	a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:9"><sup>9</sup></span>
	What benefit for the doer in that he has labored?
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:10"><sup>10</sup></span>
	I saw the business which God has given man, to agonize over.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:11"><sup>11</sup></span>
	Everything that he has made, is beautiful in its time. Also the world, he gave in their hearts--- without which why a man will not find any deed done by God, from the first to the last.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:12"><sup>12</sup></span>
	I knew that there is nothing good in these, if not to rejoice, to make good while he lives.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:13"><sup>13</sup></span>
	And also every man that ate and drank, and saw good things out of all his labor--- a gift of god, it is.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:14"><sup>14</sup></span>
	I knew that everything done by God will exist forever--- nothing may be added to it, and nothing can be taken away, and God has made it so that one will fear his presence.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:15"><sup>15</sup></span>
	What was already is, and what will be already was, and God will demand the chased.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:16"><sup>16</sup></span>
	And I also saw, under the sun, the place of judgment, there the evil is, and the place of justice, there the evil are.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:17"><sup>17</sup></span>
	I said to myself-- God will judge both the righteous and the wicked: because there is a time for all that's sought, and for every deed, there.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:18"><sup>18</sup></span>
	I said to myself-- God will sort out over the happenings of man, and see that they are beasts, they are.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:19"><sup>19</sup></span>
	Because the events of men and the events of beasts, they to them are one and the same. As one dies, so the other dies, and one spirit for all. And there is no man who is elevated from the beast, because the whole is a mirage.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:20"><sup>20</sup></span>
	All things to one place are going, all came from the dust, and all returns to dust
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:21"><sup>21</sup></span>
	Who knows whether the spirit of man, if up above it goes, and the spirit of the beast, if down to the ground it goes?
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:22"><sup>22</sup></span>
	And I saw that there is nothing better than that a man will be happy in what he does, because this is his allotment. Because who will bring us to see of what will come after him?
	</p>
	<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Chapter_4">Chapter 4</span></h2>
	<p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:1"><sup>1</sup></span>
	And I returned, and I saw all the oppression which exists under the sun. And here is the teardrop of the oppressed, and they have none to comfort them, and with the hands of their oppressors comes power, and they have none to comfort them.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:2"><sup>2</sup></span>
	And I praise the place of dead, who passed away from their lives, over that of those still alive.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:3"><sup>3</sup></span>
	And better than both, those who have not yet been, who did not see the evil deeds which are done under the sun.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:4"><sup>4</sup></span>
	And I saw all labor, and all skilled talent, as the envy of one man toward his peer, this too is a mirage and herding the wind.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:5"><sup>5</sup></span>
	The fool grasps together his own hands, and eats his own flesh.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:6"><sup>6</sup></span>
	Better a handful of restfulness than an armful of labor and herding the wind.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:7"><sup>7</sup></span>
	And I returned, and I saw a mirage, under the sun.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:8"><sup>8</sup></span>
	There is one without a second one, he doesn't even have a son or a brother, and there is no end to all his labors. His eye will not be satisfied with wealth, "And for whom do I labor and shed my soul of goodness?" This too is a mirage, and it is a bad business.  
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:9"><sup>9</sup></span>
	Better the two than the one: that they have a good wage for their labor.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:10"><sup>10</sup></span>
	Because if they should fall, one would raise his partner up, while if only one should fall, there would be no second to raise him up.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:11"><sup>11</sup></span>
	Also if two should lay down, they will be warm, and to only one, how shall he keep warm?
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:12"><sup>12</sup></span>
	And if the one should be attacked, two would stand against him. A tripled-over string will not quickly break.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:13"><sup>13</sup></span>
	Better is a child, poor and wise, than a king, old and foolish, who would no longer know to heed advice.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:14"><sup>14</sup></span>
	Because the king exited from a prison, because even in his own reign, he was born to poverty.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:15"><sup>15</sup></span>
	I saw all life that transpires under the sun, along with the child, the second who stands under him.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:16"><sup>16</sup></span>
	Even with no end to people, and to all that is placed before them, even the last ones will not rejoice to him: because this too is a mirage and herding the wind.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:17"><sup>17</sup></span>
	Mind your legs while you walk to the house of God, and listen carefully, to the fools that give sacrifice, because they don't understand doing evil.
	</p>
	<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Chapter_5">Chapter 5</span></h2>
	<p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:1"><sup>1</sup></span>
	Don't let your words startle in excitement, and let your heart not race, to bring forth something before God. Because God is in the sky, and you on the earth, hence your things will be meager.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:2"><sup>2</sup></span>
	Because a dream comes in many events, the voice of a fool with many words.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:3"><sup>3</sup></span>
	When you tend a vow to God, don't be late to redeem it, because there is no use for fools: that which you vow, redeem. 
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:4"><sup>4</sup></span>
	Better that you not vow, than that you vow and do not redeem.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:5"><sup>5</sup></span>
	Don't lend your voice to cause sin upon your flesh, and do not say before the angel that it was a mistake: why should God fume at your voice, and sabotage your hands' doing?
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:6"><sup>6</sup></span>
	Because in the many dreams and mirages and many events: fear only God.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:7"><sup>7</sup></span>
	If you see an oppressor of the poor, a perverted judgment and justice, in the nation, don't gape at the find, because the guardian is higher than high, also there are those higher than them.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:8"><sup>8</sup></span>
	And every earthly benefit come for the king who to the fields would labor.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:9"><sup>9</sup></span>

	So until the sun will darken, and the light and the moon, and the stars, and the clouds return after the rain.

	On the day that the guardians of the house will shake, and the the soldiers will distort, and the millers shall be idle because they dwindled in number, and the lights will darken in the windows.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:4"><sup>4</sup></span>
	And the doors in the marketplace will close, in the fading sound of the mill, and to the sound of the birds it will arise, and all the song-girls will lay low.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:5"><sup>5</sup></span>
	Also they will fear the on high, and along the path terrors, and the almond shall blossom and the locust will be burdened<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>, and the caperberry shall fail, because a man is walking to the eternal home, and the mourners surround the marketplace.

	Until the silver rope is snapped<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>, and the golden bowl is cracked, and the pitcher breaks on the fountain, and the cover-wheel crumbles into the well.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:7"><sup>7</sup></span>
	And the dust returns to the Earth, as it was, and the spirit returns to God, who gave it.

	Vapid mirage, said Koheleth, everything is a mirage.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:9"><sup>9</sup></span>
	And as Koheleth became wiser, so he taught wisdom to the people, and he listened and he investigated, and he set many sayings.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:10"><sup>10</sup></span>
	Koheleth asked to find things of use, and right writing, truthful words.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:11"><sup>11</sup></span>
	The words of wise men planted as fasteners and ramparts in the pages of anthologies; they were given by one shepherd.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:12"><sup>12</sup></span>
	And more than of these, my son, be careful: to making many books there is no end, and too much studying afflicts the flesh.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:13"><sup>13</sup></span>
	Word's end, everything is heard: Fear God, and keep his commandments, because this is all to man.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:14"><sup>14</sup></span>
	Because to every deed God will bring judgment, over all that's hidden, whether good, or bad.

I tried futile, but it doesn't work in some verses, vapor and vapid work as the noun and adjective form, but are a little imprecise. Mirage is better, with the subtle connotation of fraud, illusion, and vapor, but it has no good adjective form meaning "like a mirage", although you could use the word mirage itself as an adjective neologism. Bullshit is possibly closest, although it has the wrong connotation of profanity, and bogus is OK, but has no noun form, "bogosity" is too ponderous and "bogusness" is just ridiculous. King James uses "vanity", but in an archaic meaning as a noun form of "vain" in the sense of "this endeavor has been in vain". This solution is the worst of all, since it alters meaning, so it is even worse than "bullshit". (regarding 'all' and 'a mirage', See talk).</span>

"The sun went" is approximately the same double meaning, in the opinion of the translator.</span>

Since the correction is of a tiny jot on the bottom of one letter, and the meaning is much clearer in the parallel construction that follows, I translated the traditional correction.</span>
