	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:7"><sup>7</sup></span>And God made the dome, and separated the water which was below the dome from the water which was above the dome; and it was so.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:8"><sup>8</sup></span> And God called the dome 'sky'. And it was evening, and it was morning, a second day<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:9"><sup>9</sup></span> And God said, "The waters below the sky are to pool in one place, and the dry land show." And it was so.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:10"><sup>10</sup></span> And God called the dry land 'earth', and the pool of water he called 'seas'. And God saw it was good.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:11"><sup>11</sup></span> And God said, "Engrassed is the Earth to be with vegetation seeding seeds, fruit trees making fruit of its kind, with its seed inside, on the land." And so it was.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:12"><sup>12</sup></span> And the land sprouted vegetation seeding seeds, of each kind, and fruit trees making fruit of its kind with its seed inside, on the land. And God saw that it was good.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:13"><sup>13</sup></span> And it was evening and it was morning, a third day.

	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:15"><sup>15</sup></span> And the lights in the dome of the sky are to light up the earth." And so it was.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:16"><sup>16</sup></span> And God made the two great lights: the big light, to govern the day, and the small light to govern the night, and the stars.

	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:31"><sup>31</sup></span> And God saw everything which he had done, and here it is, very good! And it was evening, and it was morning: the sixth day.

	And God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because on it he rested from his creation which was created by God for making.

	<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Chapter_2">Chapter 2</span></h2>

	These are the lineages<sup id="cite_ref-toldot_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-toldot-11">[11]</a></sup> of the sky and the earth, when they were created, on the day that Yahweh<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> God made earth and sky.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:5"><sup>5</sup></span>
	No field bush was yet on the earth, and and no field grass had yet sprouted, because Yahweh God had not sprinkled rain on the earth, and no man was there to work the ground.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:6"><sup>6</sup></span>
	Then a mist rose up from the earth, and irrigated all the surface of the earth.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:7"><sup>7</sup></span>
	And Yahweh God created a man <i>(adam)</i>, dust from the ground <i>(adamah)</i>, and blew in his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living spirit.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:8"><sup>8</sup></span>
	And Yahweh God planted a garden in Eden, to the east; and he put there the man whom he had crafted.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:9"><sup>9</sup></span>
	And Yahweh God grew from the ground every tree pleasant to see and good for food, and the tree of life inside the garden, and the tree of knowing right and wrong.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:10"><sup>10</sup></span>
	And a river came out of Eden to irrigate the garden, and from there it split and became four sources.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:11"><sup>11</sup></span>
	The name of the one was Pishon, which wound about all the land of Ḥavilah<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>, where there is gold. 
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:12"><sup>12</sup></span>
	And the gold of that land is good; there is bdellium and onyx stones.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:13"><sup>13</sup></span>
	And the name of the second river was Giḥon, and it wound about all the land of Kush<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:14"><sup>14</sup></span>
	And the name of the third river is Tigris, which goes to the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.<sup id="cite_ref-dots_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-dots-18">[18]</a></sup>
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:15"><sup>15</sup></span>
	And Yahweh God took the man, and set him in the garden of Eden, for him to work and to maintain.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:16"><sup>16</sup></span>
	And Yahweh God commanded the man, "From all the trees of the garden, you may eat.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:17"><sup>17</sup></span>
	But from the tree of knowing right and wrong, you will not eat, because the day you eat from it, you'll die a certain death."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:18"><sup>18</sup></span>
	And Yahweh God said: "It is no good that the man is to be alone. I will make him a helpmate, complementing him."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:19"><sup>19</sup></span>
	And Yahweh God formed from the ground every wild animal, and every bird in the sky, and brought to the man to see what he would call it. And anything the man called a living thing, that was its name.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:20"><sup>20</sup></span>
	And the human gave names to all domestic beasts and to birds of the sky, and to all wild animals, and the man did not find a helpmate to complement him.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:21"><sup>21</sup></span>
	And Yahweh God dropped the man into a deep sleep, and as he slept, took one of his rib-bones, and closed the flesh back beneath.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:22"><sup>22</sup></span>
	And Yahweh God built the rib-bone which he had taken from the man into a woman, and he brought her to the man.

	Then, when Jacob saw Rachel, daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and the flock of Laban, his mother's brother, he approached and rolled the stone off the mouth of the well, and watered the flock of Laban, his mother's brother.

	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="30:38"><sup>38</sup></span>
	And he displayed the sticks which he had peeled in the troughs in the waterways where the flocks came to drink, in front of the flocks. And they copulated when they came to drink.<sup id="cite_ref-187" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-187">[187]</a></sup> 
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="30:39"><sup>39</sup></span>
	The flocks copulated in front of the sticks, and the flocks gave birth spotted and dotted and parti-colored. 
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="30:40"><sup>40</sup></span>
	Jacob separated the sheep, and he set aside the flocks facing, spotted and all-brown, in Laban's flock, and gathered flocks onto himself, and did not mix them with Laban's flocks.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="30:41"><sup>41</sup></span>
	And for every copulation of vigorous sheep or goats, Jacob put out the sticks in the watering-troughs for them to see, so they would copulate with sticks.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="30:42"><sup>42</sup></span>
	But for the flock's feeble, he didn't. So to Laban went the feeble, and to Jacob the vigorous.

	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="31:2"><sup>2</sup></span>
	And Jacob saw Laban's expression now, and it wasn't with him like yesterday, or the day before.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="31:3"><sup>3</sup></span>
	So Yahweh said to Jacob, "Return to your fathers' land, to your birthplace, and I'll be with you." 
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="31:4"><sup>4</sup></span>
	And Jacob summoned Rachel and Leah to the field where his flock was. 
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="31:5"><sup>5</sup></span>
	And he said to them:
	</p>
	<blockquote><p> I see your father's expression, that he isn't with me like he was yesterday, the day before. But my father's God has been with me.

	And you know that I served your father with all my power. 
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="31:7"><sup>7</sup></span>
	But your father slighted me, and changed my wages a dozen times, but God did not allow him to harm my standing. <sup id="cite_ref-188" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-188">[188]</a></sup>
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="31:8"><sup>8</sup></span>
	And if he said this — "The dotted will be your wages." — then all the flocks bore dotted. Or if he said that — "The spotted ones will be your wages." — then all the flocks bore spotted. 
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="31:9"><sup>9</sup></span>
	So God released your father's livestock, and gave it to me. 
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="31:10"><sup>10</sup></span>
	And then, when the flocks were copulating, I lifted up my gaze and saw, in a dream, that here: the he-goats mounting the females are spotted and dotted and piebald.

	And an angel of God in the dream said to me "Jacob".

	And he said, "Please, lift your gaze, and see that all the he-goats mounting the flock are spotted and dotted and piebald, because I saw all that Laban did to you.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="31:13"><sup>13</sup></span>
	I am the Beth-El God, there where you anointed a monument, where you vowed a vow to me. Now rise up, leave this land, and return to the land of your birth."

	<p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="31:14"><sup>14</sup></span>
	And Rachel and Leah answered, and they said to him, "Do we still have any part in our father's inheritance?
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="31:15"><sup>15</sup></span>
	Because he considered us as strangers, because he has sold us. And he's also eaten up the money we cost.

	Therefore all the wealth which God has confiscated from our father is ours, and our sons'. So now, all that God told you to do, do." 
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="31:17"><sup>17</sup></span>

	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="31:26"><sup>26</sup></span>
	And Laban said to Jacob:

	<p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="31:31"><sup>31</sup></span>

	Whoever you find your gods with will not live! In front of our kin, go through what I've got here, and take them." And Jacob didn't know that Rachel had stolen them.

	But Rachel had taken the house-gods, and put them in the camel's saddle, and sat on top of them. And Laban rifled through the whole tent, but did not find them.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="31:35"><sup>35</sup></span>

	<p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:1"><sup>1</sup></span>
	And Jacob settled in the land where his fathers wandered, in Canaan's land.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:2"><sup>2</sup></span>
	And these are Jacob's lineages:<sup id="cite_ref-toldot_11-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-toldot-11">[11]</a></sup>
	</p><p>Joseph, seventeen years old, was a shepherd along with his brothers, and he was a teenager along with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives. And Joseph came with a bad report about them to their father.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:3"><sup>3</sup></span>
	And Israel loved Joseph most of all his sons, because he was a son to his old age, and he made him an ornate gown.<sup id="cite_ref-208" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-208">[208]</a></sup> 
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:4"><sup>4</sup></span>
	And his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, and they hated him, and couldn't talk friendly to him. 
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:5"><sup>5</sup></span>
	And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told his brothers, and they hated him even more.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:6"><sup>6</sup></span>
	And he said to them: "Listen please, to this dream that I dreamed.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:7"><sup>7</sup></span>
	And here we are binding bundles in the field, and here my bundle rises up, also erect. And here: your bundles come around it, and bow down to my bundle."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:8"><sup>8</sup></span>
	And his brothers told him: "So you will reign a king over us? Rule over as a ruler?" and they continued to add to their hatred of him, for his dreams and his words.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:9"><sup>9</sup></span>
	And he dreamed another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, "Here, I dreamed another dream. And now, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bow down to me."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:10"><sup>10</sup></span>
	And he told his father and his brothers. And his father reproached him, and said to him: "What is this dream which you dreamed? Come, will I myself and your mother and your brothers come to bow down to you?"
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:11"><sup>11</sup></span>
	And his brothers were jealous of him. And his father remembered this thing.
	</p><p><br>
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:12"><sup>12</sup></span>
	And his brothers went to herd the sheep when their father was in Shechem.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:13"><sup>13</sup></span>
	And Israel said to Joseph, "Since your brothers are sheep herding in Shechem — you go, I'll send you to them."
	</p><p>And he told him, "Here I am."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:14"><sup>14</sup></span>
	And he said to him, "Please go and see how your brothers are doing, and how the sheep are doing, and come back with news."
	</p><p>And he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he came towards Shechem.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:15"><sup>15</sup></span>
	And a man found him, and here he was in the wrong field. So the man asked him, "What do you want?"
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:16"><sup>16</sup></span>
	And he said, "I'm asking you about my brothers. Please tell me, where are they sheep herding?"
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:17"><sup>17</sup></span>
	And the man said, "They drove out of this field. Because I heard them say 'Let's go to Dothan.'"
	</p><p>So Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:18"><sup>18</sup></span>
	They saw him in the distance, and before he would approach them, they colluded against him, to kill him.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:19"><sup>19</sup></span>
	And they said, man to his brother, "Here comes the master of dreams.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:20"><sup>20</sup></span>
	And now we'll go and we'll kill him, and we'll throw him in one of the wells, and we'll say a vicious animal ate him, and we'll see what will be of his dreams."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:21"><sup>21</sup></span>
	And Reuben heard, and rescued him from them. He said, "Let's not take a soul."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:22"><sup>22</sup></span>
	And Reuben said to them: "Don't spill blood. Throw him into that well in the wilderness, and don't lay a hand on him," so that he could rescue him from them and return him to their father.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:23"><sup>23</sup></span>
	And so, when Joseph came to his brothers, then they stripped him of his gown, the ornate gown he was wearing.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:24"><sup>24</sup></span>
	And they took him, and they threw him into the well, an empty well with no water.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:25"><sup>25</sup></span>
	And they went back to eating bread, and they lifted their gaze and saw: here is a procession of Ishmaelites coming from Gilad, and their camels are carrying spices and balm and laudenum, to transport to Egypt.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:26"><sup>26</sup></span>
	And Judah said to his brothers, "What is the point if we kill our brother and cover up his blood-cost?
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:27"><sup>27</sup></span>
	Let's go and sell him to the Ishmaelites, so we won't lay a hand on him, because he's our brother, our flesh." And his brothers listened.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:28"><sup>28</sup></span>
	And Midianites passed by, merchants, and they pulled Joseph up and out of the well, and they sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty silver. And they brought Joseph to Egypt.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:29"><sup>29</sup></span>
	And Reuben returned to the well, and here: Joseph's not in the well! And he ripped his clothes.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:30"><sup>30</sup></span>
	And he returned to his brothers to say: "The boy is gone. And me, where will I go?"
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:31"><sup>31</sup></span>
	And they took Joseph's gown and they slaughtered a he-goat, and they dipped the gown in the blood.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:32"><sup>32</sup></span>
	And they threw the striped gown down, and they brought it to their father, and they said, "We found this. Identify it please. Is it your son's gown or not?"
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:33"><sup>33</sup></span>
	And he recognized it, and said, "This is my son's gown. A vicious animal has eaten him. Preyed on Joseph as prey."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:34"><sup>34</sup></span>
	And Jacob ripped his gowns, and put a sack on his hips, and mourned over his son many days.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:35"><sup>35</sup></span>
	And all his sons and daughters arose to comfort him, but he would not be comforted, and he said, "I'll go to the underworld still grieving for my son." And he wept for him, his father.
	</p><p><br>
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:36"><sup>36</sup></span>
	And the Midianites sold him to Egypt, to Photiphar, Pharaoh's officer, chief executioner.<sup id="cite_ref-tabachim_209-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-tabachim-209">[209]</a></sup>

	<p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:1"><sup>1</sup></span>
	And it was at that time that Judah went away from his brothers and travelled to an Adulamite by the name of Ḥira.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:2"><sup>2</sup></span>
	And Judah there saw the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua', and he married her and came to her.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:3"><sup>3</sup></span>
	And she conceived, and bore a son and named him 'Er <i>(Aroused)</i>.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:4"><sup>4</sup></span>
	And she conceived again and bore a son and named him Onan <i>(Wanker)</i>.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:5"><sup>5</sup></span>
	And continued, and bore a son, and named him Shelah <i>(Hers)</i>; and she gave birth to him at Ḥeziv.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:6"><sup>6</sup></span>
	And Judah took a wife for his firstborn 'Er, her name Tamar.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:7"><sup>7</sup></span>
	And 'Er, Judah's firstborn, Yahweh saw as evil, so Yahweh put him to death.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:8"><sup>8</sup></span>
	And Judah said to Onan, come to your brother's wife and impregnate her, build offspring for your brother.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:9"><sup>9</sup></span>
	But Onan knew that the offspring wouldn't be his, so when he would go to his brother's wife he wasted it on the ground, so as not to give his brother offspring.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:10"><sup>10</sup></span>
	And Yahweh saw this as wrong, what he did, and killed him too.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:11"><sup>11</sup></span>
	And Judah said to Tamar his bride, return as widow to your father's house, until Shelah my son grows. Because he thought, "Lest he die too, like his brothers." And Tamar went to live in her father's house.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:12"><sup>12</sup></span>
	And many days went by, and Shua's daughter, Judah's wife, died. And Judah was comforted, and he and his friend the Adulamite Ḥira went to his sheep-shearers, to Timnath.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:13"><sup>13</sup></span>
	And Tamar was told this: "Here, your father-in-law's going to Timnath, to shear his sheep."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:14"><sup>14</sup></span>
	And she removed her widow's garments, and covered herself with a veil, and wrapped up, and she sat at the entrance to 'Einayim <i>(Two-Eyes)</i> which is on the way to Timna: because she saw that her man had grown, and she wasn't given him as wife.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:15"><sup>15</sup></span>
	And Judah saw her, and thought her a prostitute, because she had covered her face.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:16"><sup>16</sup></span>
	And he turned to her on the way, and said, "Let me come to you," because he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law.
	</p><p>And she said, "What will you give me, if you come to me?"
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:17"><sup>17</sup></span>
	And he said, "I will send a kid goat from the flock."

	And he said, "What collateral should I give you?",
	</p><p>and she said, "Your signet, your cord, and the staff you're holding." And he gave her, and he came to her, and she conceived by him.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:19"><sup>19</sup></span>
	And she got up and walked away, and took away her veil and put on the clothes of her widowhood.

	And Judah sent the kid-goat, through his Adulamite friend, to take the collateral from the hands of the woman, and he did not find her.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:21"><sup>21</sup></span>
	And he asked the men of the place, saying, "Where is she, the whore at Einayim, on the path?"
	</p><p>But they said, "There wasn't any whore there."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:22"><sup>22</sup></span>
	And he returned to Judah, saying, "I didn't find her. Also, the people of the place said 'there wasn't any whore there'."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:23"><sup>23</sup></span>
	And Judah said, "Take it to her, or else we're disgraced. Here I sent this kid-goat, and you didn't find her."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:24"><sup>24</sup></span>
	And it was three months later that it was told to Judah: "Your daughter-in-law Tamar whored around, and also conceived, through her whoring."
	</p><p>And Judah said, "Take her out and burn her."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:25"><sup>25</sup></span>
	She found out, and she sent to her father-in-law, saying: "I'm pregnant by the man whose these are." And she said, "Please recognize whose signet and cord and staff these are."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:26"><sup>26</sup></span>
	And Judah recognized them, and said, "She is more righteous than I am, because for this reason I did not give her to Shelah my son," and he never ceased laying with her.<sup id="cite_ref-210" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-210">[210]</a></sup>.

	And at the time of childbirth, there are twins in her belly.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:28"><sup>28</sup></span>
	And during her labor, one extended a hand and the midwife took it, and tied a thread on his hand, to mean, 'this one came out first.'

	And as he retracted his arm his brother came out, and she said, "How you've burst out <i>(Paraẓta)</i> through your breech <i>(Pereẓ)</i>!", and named him Pereẓ.

	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="39:3"><sup>3</sup></span>
	His master saw that Yahweh was with him, so that everything that he does, Yahweh makes succeed in his hands.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="39:4"><sup>4</sup></span>
	And Joseph looked all right to him, and he waited on him. And he appointed him over his household, and everything he had, he put in his hands.<sup id="cite_ref-matsa-chen_50-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-matsa-chen-50">[50]</a></sup>
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="39:5"><sup>5</sup></span>
	And from the time that he appointed him head of household and everything he has, Yahweh blessed the Egyptian's household, because of Joseph. And Yahweh's blessing was on everything that he owned, in the house and in the field.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="39:6"><sup>6</sup></span>
	And he left everything he had in Joseph's hands, and didn't look to a thing about him except the bread he ate. And Joseph was well groomed and handsome.
	</p><p><br>
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="39:7"><sup>7</sup></span>
	And it was after these events that the wife of his master lifted her eyes to Joseph, and said, "Sleep<sup id="cite_ref-211" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-211">[211]</a></sup> with me."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="39:8"><sup>8</sup></span>

	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="39:9"><sup>9</sup></span>
	He is not greater in this house than I am, and he has not hidden anything from me, except for you, because you are his wife. So how could I do this great wrong? I would sin against God."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="39:10"><sup>10</sup></span>
	As it was, she spoke to Joseph day after day, and he didn't listen to her, didn't sleep with her, wasn't with her.

	And since she saw that he left his garment in her hand, and escaped outside,
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="39:14"><sup>14</sup></span>
	she called the men of the household, and spoke to them, saying: "Look, he has brought us a Hebrew man to fondle us. He came to me to sleep with me, and I shouted loud.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="39:15"><sup>15</sup></span>

	And she placed his garment with her, until the master would come to his house.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="39:17"><sup>17</sup></span>
	And spoke to him the same words, saying: "The Hebrew servant, which you brought us, came to me, to fondle me.

	And as I raised my voice and shouted, he left his clothes with me, and escaped outside."

	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="40:6"><sup>6</sup></span>
	And Joseph came to them in the morning, and saw them, and both are downcast.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="40:7"><sup>7</sup></span>
	And he asked the Pharaoh's officers, who were with him under the guard of his master's house — saying: "Why are your faces so down today?"
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="40:8"><sup>8</sup></span>
	And they said to him — "We dreamed a dream, and we have no interpretation."
	</p><p>And Joseph said to them, "Why, God has interpretations — please tell me."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="40:9"><sup>9</sup></span>
	And the head server told his dream to Joseph, and said: "So, in my dream, here is a grapevine in front of me.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="40:10"><sup>10</sup></span>
	And on the vine are three branches. And one blooms and raises a pod, and upon its bunches the grapes turn ripe.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="40:11"><sup>11</sup></span>
	And Pharaoh's cup is in my hands, so I take the grapes and drain them into Pharaoh's cup, and I put the cup in Pharaoh's palm."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="40:12"><sup>12</sup></span>
	And Joseph said, "This is the interpretation: the three branches, they are three days.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="40:13"><sup>13</sup></span>
	In three days' time, Pharaoh will haul you off back to your seat and you'll serve Pharaoh's cup to his hand, in your original station, when you were his server.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="40:14"><sup>14</sup></span>
	But if you remember me, when you'll be better off, please do me a favor, and mention me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this house.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="40:15"><sup>15</sup></span>
	Because I was kidnapped, stolen from Hebrews' land. And also here I didn't do anything to get me into this pit."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="40:16"><sup>16</sup></span>
	And the head baker saw that he interpreted right<sup id="cite_ref-212" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-212">[212]</a></sup>, and said to Joseph: "As I'm in my dream, here: there are three baking baskets on my head.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="40:17"><sup>17</sup></span>
	And in the top basket is all Pharaoh's food which is baked. And the birds eat it from the basket over my head."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="40:18"><sup>18</sup></span>
	And Joseph answered, saying: "This is the interpretation: the three baskets are three days.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="40:19"><sup>19</sup></span>
	In three days, Pharaoh will haul you off, and hang you on a tree. And birds will eat your flesh off of you."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="40:20"><sup>20</sup></span>
	And it was on the third day, Pharaoh's birthday, that he held a feast for all his servants. And he hauled the head server and the head baker off among his servants.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="40:21"><sup>21</sup></span>
	And he placed the head server to serve him drinks, and he put the cup in Pharaoh's palm.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="40:22"><sup>22</sup></span>
	But the head baker, he hanged, as Joseph had interpreted for them.

	And here, from the Nile, seven cows come up, looking beautiful, healthy with meat, and they grazed in the meadow.

	And now: seven other cows come up after them from the river, looking ugly and scrawny, and they stood alongside the cows on the bank of the Nile. 
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:4"><sup>4</sup></span>
	And the ugly, scrawny cows ate the cows that were beautiful and healthy. Then Pharaoh awoke.

	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:6"><sup>6</sup></span>
	And here are seven bunches, thin and worn in front, growing after these.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:7"><sup>7</sup></span>
	And the thin stalks swallowed the seven healthy, full stalks, and Pharaoh awoke, and that was the dream.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:8"><sup>8</sup></span>
	And it was at morning, and his heart was beating, and he sent out for all the scribes of Egypt, and all her wise-men. And Pharaoh told them his dreams<sup id="cite_ref-213" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-213">[213]</a></sup>, and none could interpret them for Pharaoh.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:9"><sup>9</sup></span>

	And there with us was a Hebrew boy, servant to the chief executioner, and we told him, and he interpreted our dreams: to each as his interpretation of his dream.

	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:14"><sup>14</sup></span>
	And Pharaoh sent out and called for Joseph, and they rushed him out of the pit. And he shaved and changed robes and came to Pharaoh.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:15"><sup>15</sup></span>
	And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I dreamed a dream, and there is no interpretation. But I heard it said about you that you hear a dream, you interpret it."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:16"><sup>16</sup></span>
	And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, "Without my doing. God will answer for Pharaoh's peace of mind."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:17"><sup>17</sup></span>

	And here, from the Nile, seven cows rise up; full of healthy meat, and beautiful looking. And they graze in the meadow.

	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:20"><sup>20</sup></span>
	And the thin bad cows ate up the seven first cows, the healthy ones.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:21"><sup>21</sup></span>

	And here seven stalks, withered and front-stripped, growing after.

	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:25"><sup>25</sup></span>

	The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good stalks are seven years. It's one dream.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:27"><sup>27</sup></span>
	And the seven bad, weak cows rising after them, are seven years — and the seven weak front-stripped stalks will be seven years — of famine.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:28"><sup>28</sup></span>
	These are the words which I speak to Pharaoh. God showed Pharaoh what God is going to do."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:29"><sup>29</sup></span>
	"And here seven years are coming — a great plenty over all of Egypt.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:30"><sup>30</sup></span>
	And after them will come a seven year famine. And in Egypt we'll all forget all the plenty, and the famine will decimate the land.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:31"><sup>31</sup></span>
	And no one in the land will know satiety, because — that famine that follows — it will be very heavy."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:32"><sup>32</sup></span>
	"And as for the dream returning to Pharaoh twice? It is because the thing is ready with God, and God is hurrying to do it."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:33"><sup>33</sup></span>
	"So now, if Pharaoh sees a good wise intelligent man, to send out over the land of Egypt,
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:34"><sup>34</sup></span>
	Pharaoh will do it. And appoint officials on the land, and five-fold divide the land of Egypt, in the seven years of plenty.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:35"><sup>35</sup></span>
	And gather all the food of these following good years, and amass grain under Pharaoh's control — food-silos — which he would guard.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:36"><sup>36</sup></span>
	And the food would be a supplement for the land during the seven years of famine which will come to the land of Egypt so the land will not be decimated with hunger."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:37"><sup>37</sup></span>
	And what he said sounded good to Pharaoh, and to all his servants.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:38"><sup>38</sup></span>
	And Pharaoh said to his servants, "But will we find such a man, infused with the spirit of God?
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:39"><sup>39</sup></span>
	And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God informed you of all this, there is no one wise and intelligent as you.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:40"><sup>40</sup></span>
	You will be placed over my household, and all my people will deal by your words; only the Throne will be your superior."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:41"><sup>41</sup></span>
	And Pharaoh told Joseph: "See I have placed you over all of Egypt."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:42"><sup>42</sup></span>
	And Pharaoh took his ring off his hand, and put it on Joseph's hand. And he dressed him in shesh, and put a gold chain on his neck.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:43"><sup>43</sup></span>
	And he carried him in his secondary carriage, and called upon him, "Abrech" <i>(bless?)</i>, and put him over all of Egypt.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:44"><sup>44</sup></span>
	And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh. And no man will lift a hand or a foot in all of Egypt without you."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:45"><sup>45</sup></span>
	And Pharaoh called Joseph by the name Zephenath Paneha <i>(Tzaphnat-Pa'neaḥ/Sign-Interpreter)</i>, and he gave him Asenath the daughter of Poti Pera <i>(Poti Phera')</i> priest of On, for a wife. And Joseph went out, over the land of Egypt.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:46"><sup>46</sup></span>
	And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt, and Joseph left Pharaoh's presence, and traveled the whole of Egypt.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:47"><sup>47</sup></span>
	And in the seven years of plenty, the land made heaps.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:48"><sup>48</sup></span>
	And seven years, he collected all the food which was in the land of Egypt, and he distributed food in the cities: the food from the city's field which surrounded it, he distributed inside.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:49"><sup>49</sup></span>
	And Joseph gathered as much grain as the sand of the seas, so much that he stopped counting, because it could not be counted.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:50"><sup>50</sup></span>
	And to Joseph were born two sons, before the year of the famine came, which Asenath, the daughter of Poti Pera, priest of On, bore him.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:51"><sup>51</sup></span>
	And Joseph named the eldest Menashe: because God bore for me <i>(nashani)</i> all my burdens, and those of all my father's household.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:52"><sup>52</sup></span>
	And he named the second Ephraim: because God has made me fruitful <i>(hephrani)</i> in the land of my torment.
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:53"><sup>53</sup></span>
	And the seven years of plenty which were in the land of Egypt finished.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:54"><sup>54</sup></span>
	And the seven years of famine began, coming just as Joseph had predicted. And there was a famine in all the lands, but in all Egypt, there was bread.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:55"><sup>55</sup></span>
	And the land of Egypt hungered, and the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh told all of Egypt, "Go to Joseph, and do what he tells you."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:56"><sup>56</sup></span>
	And the famine was over the entire Earth. But Joseph opened every store they had, and it provided grain for Egypt. And the famine intensified over Egypt.
	<span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:57"><sup>57</sup></span>
	And all the Earth went to Egypt for grain, to Joseph: because the famine was strong over the entire Earth.

	And Joseph was the ruler of the land, he was the grain supplier for all the land's people. And Joseph's brothers came, and they bowed down to him, nose to the ground.

	And the men feared, because they were brought to Joseph's house, and they said, "It's on account of the money in our satchels the first time that we were brought here — to surround us and attack us, and take, us as slaves, and our donkeys."
	</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="43:19"><sup>19</sup></span>

The grammar of 1:1-3 is disputed by interpreters. It is possible to have <i>b'reshit</i> in a "construct state". In this alternate reading, there are two options: read Genesis 1:1-2 as: "Originally God created the sky and the earth, while the earth was vacuous havoc, and darkness upon the abyss." Or perhaps a single large sentence verse 1 to verse 3: "As God originally began to create the sky and the earth, and the earth was chaos and void and darkness upon the abyss, God's spirit hovering over the surface of the water, God said, 'Let there be light.' And there was light." The final version seems an unnatural translation to one of the translators here (RM) because such a sentence is very grammatically complex, requiring an enormous center embedding of a full sentence, and the rest of Genesis has no comparable center embedding (or, for that matter, any center embedding at all). Intepreters are divided as to the construct vs. absolute question in general. The most naive straightforward reading is the one translated, although whether the creation described is fully ex-nihilo or not is not clear in the text, and is hopefully equally vague in the translation, since this requires interpretation.</span>

The Hebrew phrase תהו ובהו <i>tohu wavohu</i> expresses a sense of primordial chaos, tohu--- vacuous, emptiness, or incompleteness, vohu--- chaos. Various translations have been proposed. Appearing here were "helter skelter" (too fidgety), "higgledy piggledy" (too silly), chaos and void, unformed and unfirmed (not accurate enough), havoc and waste, chaos and waste, vacuous chaos, chaos and void. The usage of waste in "chaos and waste" is that of "wasteland", and it conflicts with the sense adopted for waste which is more corrupted and decayed for translations of shachat. The term "inchoate chaos" is perfect in both form and meaning.</span>

Robert Young of <i>Young's Literal Translation</i> gives "expanse", while the King James Version gives "firmament". This verse is an object of religious controversy. Secular scholars read Genesis 1 as expressing the flat-earth cosmology typical of Ancient Near Eastern literature. The world is a flat disk, floating an deep sea called the <i>tehom</i> (here translated "abyss"), covered by a water-bearing solid dome called the sky, and the רקיע is the sky-dome. Later texts already acquired round-Earth cosmology from the Greeks, and the raqia' then was reinterpreted as a spherical firmament surrounding the Earth, where various demons and angels dwell and battle, and part of a successive system of solid spheres where the moon and planets are set. This reinterpretation can be dated to between the 5th and 1st centuries BC. Fundamentalist religious readers interpret Genesis 1 as a literal day-by-day description of the creation of the earth as we understand it today, so they give a more vague term which can be used to describe either the atmosphere between the sea and clouds, or a spiritual realm separate from the physical world.</span>

At the same time, noticeably missing from this list is "all the wild animals" (<i>kol hayat haarets</i>) which we might expect to find here. The Genesis account has three categories of animals: domestic animals, (larger) wild animals, and crawling animals. If the word <i>hayat</i> has been dropped by a copying error, the list would originally have contained all three categories of land creatures. The Syriac Old Testament includes "all the wild animals," where the Hebrew has "all the earth," supporting the idea that a copying error has occurred. See Kittel's <i>Biblia Hebraica,</i> which recommends reading <i>kol hayat haarets</i> here. The translation follows Kittel here.</span>

The grammar here is unique and is so archaic to be incomprehensible. The verb translated as "owned" usually means "acquire by purchase" or "buy", but in instances, it likely means "acquired" or "possess". Interpretations of this sentence include "I have created a man like Yahweh did," "With Yahweh's help I have gotten a man.", or perhaps one of many more absurd personal interpretations, like "I bought a man, I paid in Yahweh", "I haggled Yahweh down to get a man". The "own/created" interpretation is the Occam razor choice, but it is completely conjectural, and perhaps leaves the verse making more sense than it should.

It literally means "a swelling", like a swelling up. Due to the ridiculous coincidence of English having an exact parallel term, unfortunately somewhat dated slang, the translation here did not avoid the temptation. God's tone is usually avuncular and light hearted in this narration (unlike, for instance, snake's tone, or many instances of God's voice in the Exodus narration), so one of the translators (RM) suggest "swell" is not so out of line as it might sound at first due to its informality in English.</span>

The Hebrew <i>oph</i>, here translated as <i>flier</i>, is the most common word for "bird" in the Bible, although it technically can include flying insects as well. Therefore, one possibility is that an editor added the words <i>every bird, every wing</i>, meaning <i>every winged bird</i> to clarify that in this case, Noah was <i>only</i> taking in birds, and not insects. On the other hand, perhaps the word <i>wing</i> means <i>winged insect</i> in this context.

In addition, Noah becomes a hermit, and Noah's daughters are under the impression that nobody is left alive but their family, requiring them to impregnate themselves with their father.

The robe is torn and dipped in blood to fake an animal attack. The other occurrence is in the story of Tamar, who is given a <i>passim</i> robe, "because so were the virgin daughters of the king dressed" (2 Samuel 13:18). After being raped by her brother, she tears the garment in anger or shame (13:19).
