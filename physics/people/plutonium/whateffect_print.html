	<h3><i>What effect did Archimedes Plutonium and his Plutonium Atom Totality theory have upon your view of the world?</i></h3>

	<div>
		<p>Everyone was trying to figure out this new medium, the internet, what it was for. It was clearly going to take over the world, this was obvious, although at the time, I imagined it would continue to be more text-based. Authority was a hinderance, Pauli-language, direct bluntness, was an advantage. It was like the physicists had died and gone to heaven.</p>
		
		<p>Then into this heaven came this guy, out of the blue, writing what was essentially poetry in his own language derived from science. He was talking about how we are "electrons, in the electron dot cloud..." of a gigantic plutonium atom, and you could see that he was serious about it. He went on to describe how we would become aware of this, because pi was 22/7 and there are 22 electrons in this orbital and 7 electrons in that orbital of the plutonium atom. It was crazy stuff, but it was mountains! It didn't stop, walls and walls of unique text, I have never seen such prolific writing. It flowed out of him like water out of a tap. Every day, there would be four, five, six long pages of unique text, all about a different completely original idea you had not only never heard before, you couldn't even conceive of hearing before you heard it.</p>
		
		<p>The only comparable originality was in other usenet competitors, Abian suggested to blow up the moon, and explained that mass was used up to "push time forward" (itself funny to a positivist). But all this stuff was like the Salieri to Plutonium's Mozart. It was as if he was born for this medium.</p>
		
		<p>My own impression at the time was that this had to be the greatest crackpot who had ever lived, the most prolific, the most ingenious, the most poetic guy who had ever described all those ideas that physicists get in unsolicited manuscripts in their mailbox. I thought that, since the internet would quickly bring scientific literacy to everyone, that he was also the last of the crackpots, that this was the swan-song of crackpottery before the new age of reason.</p>
		
		<p>I know better now. I don't consider Plutonium a crackpot at all, rather a deep poet of the internet era, a poet who worked in the medium of science prose, to express a scientific religiosity that is difficult to express, except through his unique method. There will never be another like him. I strive to be as original as him every day, and when I am not productive, I always am ashamed, because Plutonium would be writing seven pages full of unique original ideas in the time it takes me to get just a handful of boring pedestrian ideas that do nothing to break the mold. It is humbling to compare yourself to him.</p>
		
		<p>His ideas kept on coming, seemingly inexhaustibly. The "fusion barrier principle", the "stone throwing principle", and so on and so on. You couldn't help but admire the determination. Holy crap--- this guy is producing a stream of original writing and thought with no comparison in the history of writing, let alone of scientific crazy-writing. It was idea after idea after idea, all of them completely mad, but you could begin to see the coherence behind them, that they were based on expressing the innermost content of his soul. He was getting a ton of attention, because his writing was interesting and exciting, the writing style was new, you had never seen such writing before. And it fit the medium. I don't think anyone understood usenet better than Plutonium.</p>
		
		<p>From this, I learned how to write for the internet. I tried to learn to match him in tone, because his tone was the right tone, but I strived hard to be dead-on accurate with the content, walking this straightjacket between honesty and accuracy and complete exploratory originality. I think it has gotten easier with age, whether because the originality diminishes, or because one has more experience, I am not sure.</p>
		
		<p>For me, constrained as I was by the requirements of complete accuracy and internal intellectual honesty, I despaired when I saw this guy--- how can a person who demanded accuracy ever compete in originality and fecundity with such a mind? How could your own work ever compare with such a stream of creativity? It was going to be impossible to do. It meant that the bar for creativity had been raised for everyone, permanently.</p>
		
		<p>I wrote a Wikipedia page for Archimedes Plutonium, since deleted: <a href="wiki_AP.html">Archimedes Plutonium</a></p> 

		<p>One of the nicest parts of writing this page is that I got to have a long conversation with Plutonium, who came booming down like the voice of Moses from the mountain, and explained that I had forgotten the all important "leading zero" of the Plutonium integer multiplication, and that I was overemphasizing one of his most trite observations, the notion of "googlebombing". I explained to him that googlebombing was stolen by an academic, and that I wanted to make sure he got proper credit for it. But he felt it was too trivial compared to the deeper things, the Plutonium totality, the stone-throwing idea, the fusion barrier thing.</p>

		<p>The reason I focused on the Plutonium integers is because this is what got me interested in mathematical logic. It was clearly a consistent nonstandard model of arithmetic, more or less, but it was clear also that here the integers were uncountable!</p>

		<p>So many people had argued that the reals were countable, this is the standard objection to Cantor. It's what you get when you Skolem reduce. But here was a person arguing something that clearly no one had ever considered before--- that the reals are equinumerous with the integers, not because the reals are countable, but because the integers are uncountable! The very contradiction in terms makes it stunning, but the "digit arrangements" he talks about make the uncountability manifest (uncountability of the integers in the model, as seen from outside the model itself of course).</p>

		<p>Plutonium's exchange on the talk page of the Wikiepdia article was very intimidating (here it is: <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg%2Fsci.math%2FKM_AC9I-prs%2FsGcLDIpyzoUJ">Google Groups</a> ). You always knew you were talking to Plutonium, because his voice would not waver. I felt like I was talking to one of the great Beat poets, to Ginsberg, or Bukowski. His voice was a thundering boom from the mountaintop. It constantly urges you: do better. What is wrong with you? You can be more original than this.</p>

					<p><em>I think Ron's making the point that if you go around making casual remarks like that against people not diagnosed as insane by psychologists, then why shouldn't people describe you in the same way for their reasons?</em></p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><em>Indeed if he were less flagrantly a raving nutter that might have been a good point. But we're talking word salad here.</em></p>
						<blockquote>
							<p><em>No, there's an intelligent organisation to AP's postings using the axioms of his belief system, just as for Thomas Aquinas writing on The Angels. I doubt you can provide a link to any of his "word salads".</em></p>

								<em><p>Thomas Aquinas on angels is a low bar to clear - basically he's just making shit up: ANGELS--Teachings from St. Thomas Aquinas. <a href="http://www.jesus-passion.com/angels.htm">ANGELS--Teachings from St. Thomas Aquinas</a></p><p>However it seems to me that AP isn't even that coherent - at least TA is using words in their everyday meanings whereas AP doesn't amount to much more than bad poetry with technical terms. It's hard to find samples of his writings because much of it was on Usenet, but I would regard this as word salad: <a href="http://sci.tech-archive.net/Archive/sci.chem/2004-09/0921.html">sci.chem: Re: changes to website of Archimedes Plutonium Re: can it see the atoms during superconduction?

									<em><p>The linguist Chomsky gave this as an example of a word salad:</p>
									<p>"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously."</p>
									<p>This is your example:</p>
									<p>"Back in 1994 I thought the correct theory of superconductivity was photons<br>
									flipping into neutrinos where neutrinos fly through matter with almost zero<br>
									resistance. That idea may still be part of the true theory when it is fully<br>
									known in the future.<br>
									But during the intervening years of 1994 to 2004 I found what to me is a better<br>
									theory of superconductivity. Because of experimental facts that<br>
									superconductivity temperatures can be lowered by the addition of doping<br>
									elements. I found and favored the theory of Maximal Electronegativity and<br>
									Electropositivity. That Superconductivity is not a fancy quantum phenomenon of<br>
									photons flipping into neutrinos but rather instead just Classical Physics of<br>
									electronegativity and electropositivity being maximized."</p>
									<p>Isn't it obvious that he's writing about his theory of superconductivity in 1994, and how it changed between 1994-2004?</p>
									<p>Looks more like the writing of a sincere uneducated eccentric or "crackpot", rather than a "nutter" who can't express their ideas coherently.</p></em>
									<blockquote>
										<em><p>In my view, "Classical Physics of electronegativity and electropositivity being maximized" isn't much better than "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously".</p></em>
										<blockquote>
											<em><p>It makes sense to me, although I don't know enough chemistry to know if it's correct. It's analogous to entropy which a system maximizes, energy it minimizes. AP is proposing similar principles for electronegativity and electropositivity.</p></em>
											<blockquote>
												<em><p>That's the point: it's using precise technical terms in a word salad - it sounds impressive but it doesn't actually mean anything.</p></em>
												<blockquote>
													<p>Oh, it means something all right, it just is something incorrect. This is why Plutonium is maddening and inspiring. He thinks completely independently, with no regard to past thinking, and produces mountains of original ideas almost all of which are hopelessly wrong, because it is far away from the cumulative understanding which is already acquired.</p>

													<p>This is not always so. He proposed spraying certain chemicals in the upper atmosphere to reverse global warming. This is an idea I have heard again from others, although its simple enough to think of that it's probably not a rip-off in either direction. He proposed google-bombing, which nobody ever even considered in 1995 or whenever he thought of it (there wasn't even a google, he called it "searchenginebombing"). This was original and important, and it got done, probably by people who read his posts, and the credit for this idea went elsewhere, an acedmic stole his idea! The academic published it under his name, and claimed he came up with the concept, figuring (insanely) that nobody remembered Plutonium, or took him seriously. That academic, whoever it was, should go find another job.</p>

													<p>His recent ideas on monopoles are not right, but the claim that monopoles are "lines" is probably related to the nucleus of the idea of the Dirac string, which you get from imagining a very skinny solenoid that ends at a point. This picture of a monopole is correct, but already old.</p>

													<p>The value of Plutonium's writing is that it shows you clearly, with no requirements of hard study, what is required to make new understanding, how to push our understanding further. The only thing he is missing to prevent him from being another Isaac Newton is the fluency in the old knowledge, and the honesty to incoporporate others criticism.</p>
